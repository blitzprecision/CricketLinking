1	501674	Bangladesh v India, Group B, World Cup 2011, Mirpur	Co-hosts spar in curtain raiser	The Preview by George Binoy	February 18, 2011	#p#Match Facts #p#February 19, Mirpur Start time 14:30 local time (08:30 GMT) #p#Few players have as much responsibility with bat and ball as Shakib Al Hasan does for Bangladesh AFP Enlarge Related Links Matches: Bangladesh v India at Dhaka Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Bangladesh | India #p#Big Picture #p#Events unfolding in Port of Spain four years ago culminated in euphoria on one side of the Bengal border, and gloom on the other. With every dance down the wicket from Tamim Iqbal, little-fancied Bangladesh landed another blow in a series of blows that would eventually eliminate India, wearied by the weight of expectation and a discordant dressing room, from the first round of the World Cup. Four years later the teams meet again, but in a tournament protected from the domino effect of a shock like the one in Trinidad. The stakes this time are different as well, for it is not just India, overwhelming favourites again, who carry a tremendous weight of expectation. #p#As Shakib Al Hasan entered the opening ceremony in a decorated cycle rickshaw, soaking in the goodwill from tens of thousands inside the Bangabandhu Stadium and the crowds surrounding it, his demeanour revealed pride and a sense of the grandeur of the occasion, and none of the reluctance he's had in captaining Bangladesh in series past. There would also have been a feeling of responsibility, of a magnitude no Bangladesh captain has ever faced before. #p#For the first time, Bangladesh are expected to go beyond the first round of a World Cup. For the first time, and largely because of a significant home advantage, their passage will not be considered an upset. For the first time, they are hosting a World Cup and can see all around them a stirring passion saturating the country. Bangladesh too will be relieved that the format allows a little room for error, while striving to avoid it against one of the tournament heavyweights. #p#Justifiably or not, India have begun several World Cups wearing the favourites tag, but never has that label been more authentic than now. Their bowling attack might blow hot and cold, but even on their most frigid days India possess a batting line-up capable of overhauling anything. And they play all their matches on the familiar pitches of home, apart from the opener against Bangladesh, which is at the Shere Bangla Stadium in Mirpur. The Indians won't say that revenge for 2007 is on their minds but there is no chance they will go into the contest with an iota of complacency. #p#Form guide (Most recent first) #p#Bangladesh : WWWLW India : LLWWL #p#Pitch and conditions #p#The pitch used for the practice game between Bangladesh and Pakistan in Mirpur had turn for the spinners. Not much is known about the surface for Saturday but it is expected to aid the slow bowlers. Dew has traditionally had an impact on day-night fixtures in Dhaka but it is supposedly not as big a concern in February. However, this is what Waqar Younis, Pakistan's coach, said after the warm-up game: "There was a little bit [of dew], maybe in the last 15 overs. It can be trouble later on in the tournament, so good luck to whoever is playing here." #p#Watch out for  #p#India's batsmen : Sehwag, Tendulkar, Gambhir, Kohli, Yuvraj, Dhoni and Yusuf. The weakest link on paper in that line-up, Virat Kohli, is also India's most in-form batsman. And Suresh Raina, who was a rabbit in South Africa but is a force on the subcontinent, is an option too. Each one is capable of producing a match-winning innings. This Indian side is calibrated for scoring a 300-plus total, and chasing one down. #p#Spin, and dew : In their last ODI at home before the World Cup, against Zimbabwe, Bangladesh played four spinners: specialists Abdur Razzak and Suhrawadi Shuvo, allrounder Shakib, and part-time offspinner Naeem Islam. On slow tracks that turn, with batsmen needing to create the pace, they can control the pace of the game. India have played just one specialist, Harbhajan Singh, in recent games and relied on a phalanx of able part-timers - Yuvraj Singh, Yusuf Pathan and Suresh Raina. Given the prominent role of spin, the dew in Mirpur, if it is heavy, could have a considerable role in the day-night contest. A slippery ball and a slick outfield will be a disadvantage for the team defending a target under floodlights. #p#A fever-pitch atmosphere : The build-up to the World Cup has visibly been more intense in Bangladesh than in either India or Sri Lanka. The excitement reached a crescendo in the hours before the opening ceremony and it is poised to spill over when the opening game gets underway. India rarely play in front of a crowd in which they have virtually no support. That is likely to happen tomorrow. If Shakib's men are looking for a little more inspiration, they will hear it reverberate around the Shere Bangla. #p#This is the beginning of Sachin Tendulkar's last World Cup, and MS Dhoni's first as captain AFP Enlarge #p#Team news #p#There was a fitness concern over Shafiul Islam, who bowled only five overs in the warm-up against Pakistan, but he is expected to be fit. Raqibul Hasan could make the XI ahead of Mohammad Ashraful and Bangladesh could also play two spinning allrounders in Mahmudullah and Naeem Islam. #p#Bangladesh (probable): 1 Tamim Iqbal, 2 Imrul Kayes, 3 Junaid Siddique, 4 Mushfiqur Rahim (wk), 5 Raqibul Hasan 6 Shakib Al Hasan (capt), 7 Mahmudullah, 8 Naeem Islam 9 Abdur Razzak, 10 Shafiul Islam, 11 Rubel Hossain. #p#After sitting out of both of India's warm-up matches with a groin niggle, Zaheer Khan bowled during India's net session and will lead the attack on Saturday. The major decision India will have to make is whether to play Kohli or Raina. Kohli has been in excellent form, but an extra left-hander, Raina, could be useful in combating Bangladesh's left-arm spinners. Dhoni, however, had indicated a few days ago that Kohli could edge Raina out. #p#India (probable): 1 Virender Sehwag, 2 Sachin Tendulkar, 3 Gautam Gambhir, 4 Virat Kohli/Suresh Raina, 5 Yuvraj Singh, 6 MS Dhoni (capt & wk), 7 Yusuf Pathan, 8 Harbhajan Singh, 9 Zaheer Khan, 10 Ashish Nehra, 11 Munaf Patel. #p#Try picking the XIs for tomorrow's game by playing Team Selector. #p#Stats and trivia #p#Mirpur is easily Bangladesh's most successful ODI venue - they've won 18 matches here, which is three times the number they've won at their next-best venue. They've won 64 games in all, which means 28% of their ODI wins have come in Mirpur. #p#The last 12 day-night matches in Mirpur have all been won by the team batting second. Overall, in 16 day-night ODIs, the team batting first has won only three times. #p#India have won seven and lost three ODIs in Mirpur, but they've beaten Bangladesh in all five matches here. Three of those were day-night games, and in all of them India chased. #p#Most of India's top order has done well in Mirpur, with Gambhir, Dhoni, Kohli and Raina all averaging more than 50, and scoring at least one century here. For Bangladesh , Shakib and Tamim have scored two hundreds each in ODIs at this venue. #p#Quotes #p#"The guys have played enough cricket to cope with the pressure. We are not looking too far ahead. We will take it one game at a time and concentrate on the job at hand. I don't think it can get better than this. Playing a strong side like India has its advantages. We want to prove ourselves against the best." Shakib Al Hasan on the eve of the beginning of Bangladesh's World Cup campaign. #p#"Being a co-host will always bring a lot of expectations. But we do not get bogged down by expectations. The important thing is to do the process right. We always look to put more emphasis on the process, rather than on winning, and this is what has made us a successful team." MS Dhoni attempts to cocoon his team from the hype around India's chances at the World Cup.
1	501691	Bangladesh v India, Group B, World Cup 2011, Mirpur	Time for us to do our job - Shakib	Sidharth Monga in Mirpur	February 18, 2011	#p#It seemed as though Shakib Al Hasan had a tear in his eye when his rickshaw entered the Bangabandhu Stadium on opening-ceremony night to thunderous applause in the sold-out venue. His right index finger swept under his eye, and a moment later he was seen smiling and talking to the child with him on the rickshaw. One could not be sure, though. A day later, Shakib confirmed it was indeed a moving moment for him. #p#"It was a great feeling yesterday," Shakib said, giggling. "I got emotional at that time. It was a very good experience for me. It's something I will remember for the rest of my lifetime." #p#And this has been going on for at least a week. It has been an emotional time in Dhaka. People have been out on the streets even in the wee hours of the morning. All Bangladesh has been thinking about for a while now is the World Cup. "As you can see, on any street of Dhaka, you can see the difference from 100 days back," Shakib said. "It has obviously changed a lot. Even at night, up until 12'o clock, people come to see the ground, the facilities, how they have improved. Great feeling for the people of the country." #p#As players, as a young team, it is difficult to stay insulated from this kind of singular anticipation from the country. And the players know that the anticipation will translate onto the field. It will translate into pressure, from the people, from the media, from their families, from their friends. #p#Nerves showed in their warm-up game against Pakistan on Tuesday, when they lost comprehensively despite spells of good play both from the bowlers and the batsmen. Generally a good fielding side, Bangladesh dropped four simple catches during the match. They started their innings in a free-flowing manner, but once they lost a wicket they froze in the middle overs, playing too many get-away shots, losing wickets in a heap. #p#Jamie Siddons, their coach, knows about these pressures. "We have talked a little bit about the pressures they are going to face: the crowds, the media, their families, and all those sort of things that are part of playing a World Cup at home," Siddons said. "I think they are getting on pretty okay with it." #p#Shakib Al Hasan: "We are taking it game by game, we are not thinking about India. We want to improve ourselves" AFP Enlarge #p#It is not just the anticipation from the country, which can sometimes be unreasonable, that will put pressure on them. Playing at home, they will expect themselves, reasonably so, to put it past at least one of the four big teams and make it to the quarterfinals. Siddons himself was quick to point that Bangladesh are rated ahead of West Indies, so they should be expected to win that game. #p#"We have to beat teams above us in the ODI rankings," Siddons said. "West Indies are just below us. We are expected to beat them; if we do that, we will get very close to going to the next round. We need to beat one of the big teams and two minnows - for the want of a better word - the Associate members, to give us a chance. Need to win four games to be safe. A lot of work to do, we start with India, and then Ireland." #p#They are no longer the underdogs. Their wins - at least in the first round - will not be considered upsets. All their previous big wins in the World Cup have come with not much to lose. This time they have a lot to lose. That is going to be Bangladesh's biggest challenge this World Cup. Already there is a mountain of hype because they beat India in the last World Cup encounter between the two teams. #p#Shakib is saying all the right things before the match. "We have six league games, that's the important thing," he said. "We are taking it game by game, we are not thinking about India. We want to improve ourselves. We want to go there and do the basics right. If we do that, hopefully we will have a very good game." #p#When asked whether what he saw last night put pressure on him, Shakib was blasé. "They came out and did their job yesterday, now it is time for us to go out and do our job," he said. The festivities are over, the song and dance is behind us. The only way the festivities will carry on in Bangladesh is if its cricket team does its job.
1	501718	Bangladesh v India, Group B, World Cup 2011, Mirpur	Dhoni plays down the pressure factor	Sambit Bal in Mirpur	February 18, 2011	#p#On the morning of the final day of the Adelaide Test of the 2003-04 series, when a tricky chase lay between India and their second Test win on Australian soil, I arrived at the ground early, sneaked on to the field where the team was playing a game of volleyball, crept up to John Wright, the India coach whom I regarded as a friend, and whispered this question. #p#"So John, what's this volleyball thing about, a couple of hours before one of the most important days of Test cricket of their lives?" #p#Wright gave me the look of astonishment. His eyes narrowed as he considered his response. I can't reproduce his words here, but I had hardly expected the spray that came my way. #p#I bumped into him in the elevator a couple of days later, and he smiled. "I don't bother you when you are working, do I?" he said, saving me the bother of asking. "Sometimes, the best way to prepare for a big day is to take your mind off it." #p#I remembered this as I watched the Indian team kick around a football in the Shere Bangla stadium, where they will open their World Cup campaign against Bangladesh on Saturday. MS Dhoni had just emerged from the pre-match press conference, where he had to respond to the same question phrased in different words and in different languages: was his team feeling the pressure? "I would have told you the exact figure," he said at one point, "if I had a machine to measure the pressure." #p#Indian players hardly need to be reminded about what is expected off them. "What to do," Dhoni said in response to another question, "there is pressure if you win, there is pressure if you lose." But out there on the turf, playing a game of football before the serious business of nets, they were like eager boys showing off their skills without feeling the obligation to perform. #p#Bangladesh are hardly pushovers in one-day cricket, and certainly not in their own conditions when their bowlers are as good as any in the world. But India, massive favourites in this World Cup and on whom rest not only the hopes of their fans rest but also the commercial success of the tournament, are expected to win against a team that knocked them out of the last World Cup, leading the format of the tournament to be redesigned. #p#The warm-up matches have been done and won but India are among to few teams to start the tournament against an opposition that possesses the wherewithal to knock them over. There is a precedent of a team losing the first match and going on to win the World Cup, but losing to Bangladesh would bring back the memories and the questions that India wouldn't want to revisit. #p#Yusuf Pathan's heroics in South Africa have made him a certainty, but will Suresh Raina play? AFP Enlarge #p#"We haven't even thought about it," Dhoni said when asked whether the 2007 defeat was playing on their minds, "because we don't want to repeat what happened in 2007." Seven of those who featured in that match are likely to be in the playing XI tomorrow, and four of them will form the top order that malfunctioned in Trinidad. The biggest difference between then and now, Dhoni pointed out, is that "we are in a much better frame of mind." #p#If India have any worries it is over the form of their quick bowlers. Ashish Nehra, who has been India's most consistent bowler in the format and was expected to fire in yorkers during the batting Powerplay, has been both erratic and down on pace in the warm-up matches. Munaf Patel, who was impressive in South Africa, has looked easy fodder on flatter pitches. Zaheer Khan, who sat out the warm-up games but bowled in the nets today, is certain to play and is expected to carry the attack. Nehra will perhaps be pencilled in to the share the new ball, but the nature of the pitch here makes two specialist spinners a real possibility. #p#"It's certainly an option we will consider," Dhoni said. Piyush Chawla was a rank outsider before the squad was selected but lends variety, can bat a bit and is a better fielder, all of which gives him a better chance of making the XI ahead of R Ashwin. #p#An equally big decision would be over the sixth batsman. By no means was Yusuf Pathan a certain starter before the one-dayers in South Africa but he will be impossible to leave out after his near match-winning hundred in Cape Town and his offspin lends a handy four-over option too. #p#But it's Virat Kohli's form that provides Dhoni with his happiest headache. He was India's most impressive batsman in difficult conditions in South Africa, but he would come in at the expense of Suresh Raina, who has been a fixture in the ODI squad and a vital part of Dhoni's strategy of consuming the fifth bowler's quota. #p#Whatever combination they pick, though, India's strategy will be based on a simple plan. Give their bowlers plenty to defend if they bat first. Or expect to chase down big totals. They bat big and they bat deep, and for the first time in a long time, they have all their best players to choose from. The countdown for the cup that counts begins tomorrow.
1	501739	Bangladesh v India, Group B, World Cup 2011, Mirpur	Bullish Bangladesh ready for battle	Sidharth Monga in Mirpur	February 18, 2011	Bangladesh will have to do without Mashrafe Mortaza against India, but he insists he is fit and ready if needed Associated Press Enlarge Related Links News : Time for us to do our job - Shakib Players/Officials: Aminul Islam | Mashrafe Mortaza Matches: Bangladesh v India at Dhaka Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Bangladesh #p#A day before Bangladesh kicked off their much-anticipated World Cup campaign, they were visited in the nets by two World Cup heroes, central characters from their two biggest wins in the global tournament. Aminul Islam was the captain when they shocked the world with a win over Pakistan at Trent Bridge in 1999, and Mashrafe Mortaza Man of the Match when they stunned India eight years later at Port-of-Spain. #p#Aminul, now a development officer with the Asian Cricket Council, looks just the same as he did all those years ago. Mashrafe, although hurting from a World Cup snub on fitness grounds, is the same childishly enthusiastic fellow from four years ago despite all those injuries, six surgeries on one knee, and the heartbreak and frustration that comes with it. #p#Talking to them, in a simplistic sort of way, charters Bangladesh's growth and history as a cricketing nation. Aminul remembers his side's win over Pakistan resulted in his first first-class flight. If Aminul's generation lit a flame in Bangladesh's heart, Mashrafe and friends had to keep it from dying after lukewarm years in between. #p#"It was the first World Cup for Bangladesh," Aminul says of 1999. "Our target was beat Scotland, and play better against other teams. In that regard, the start was very good. #p#"I remember a couple of journalists came to interview me before the match day. I said we will try to play better cricket, but never thought we were going to win. On that particular day we played great cricket, and were better in every department compared to Pakistan." #p#Coming slowly as it did, the win tested Bangladesh's nerves. After having Pakistan at 42 for 5 and 102 for 7, they have to wait anxiously, and persevere. The height of that examination was when the last wicket, a run-out, was referred to the third umpire. The supporters in the stands couldn't take it any more, and charged onto the field. #p#"If he [Saqlain Mushtaq, the last man] wouldn't have been given out, I don't know what would have happened. It would have taken a few hours to take the crowd out of the ground," Aminul says. #p#After the game, Aminul went to the Pakistan dressing room, and realised it was a mistake. "They [Pakistan] were never expecting to lose against Bangladesh, since they had won all the matches in the league stages," he says. "But I remember one thing, after winning I went to their dressing room, and I did not receive a very good welcome because they thought this was a disaster for them. Losing against a team like Bangladesh, they never took it well." #p#For Bangladesh, though, the win paved the way for their Test status, and also development of cricket in the country. In fact after the match, when the prime minister called to congratulate Aminul, he asked not for rewards but for more cricket grounds. Now they have a truly world-class international venue in Mirpur, plus four other international grounds. Aminul, however, wants more. #p#"It is wonderful that we have five international stadiums," Aminul says. "But I would have been happier if we had more cricket fields all around the country, for 150 million people and thousands and thousands of schools to play. We need better playing grounds for them, not stadiums." #p#He might not have had the benefits of the best playgrounds when he was growing up, but Mashrafe turned out to be one fine cricketer for Bangladesh. Man of the Match in both Bangladesh's wins over India, Mashrafe now has to sit out of the match the whole country is talking about. Still he can't keep himself from coming to the nets and training with the team. He wears his Abahani shirt to training, always. #p#"I am disappointed that I will not play a part tomorrow," he says. "The worst part is that I am fully fit now and even then I am out. But at the same time the boys who are playing are all very capable players. But I am practising hard so that I can be available if the team needs me. #p#"I am not hoping that any of our fast bowlers gets injured, but I am just staying ready if I am needed." #p#The man who used to jump off bridges onto moving vehicles, and was a sort of amateur stuntman with bikes, might have the same restless energy to him, but there is a wise head too. Talking about tomorrow's games, he says, "The main difference between the two teams is that for India if just two or three players perform, they can win against us. But for us to beat India we would need contributions from all our boys. You have to remember [Syed] Rasel, Shakib [Al Hasan], [Mohammad] Rafique all played very well in that match [that they won in 2007]. Tamim [Iqbal] performed beyond himself. Everybody chipped in and we would need a similar performance on Saturday. We cannot afford to bank on just Tamim and Shakib." #p#If 1999 earned Bangladesh Test status and recognition, the class of 2007 earned them respect. "All teams used to ignore us earlier. They would think, 'Bangladesh is coming; we will win easily.' It used to hurt a lot. Nowadays, they cannot afford to do this." Not in this World Cup for sure.

Instead, Virender Sehwag and Virat Kohli gave evidence of the havoc this Indian batting line-up can create during centuries that demoralised Bangladesh's bowlers. <m9>Shakib Al Hasan's men failed to maintain their composure in the grandest match of their lives and conceded a total beyond the reach of their batting abilities.</m9> #p#There was wisdom in Bangladesh choosing to chase - the previous 12 day-night matches at the Shere Bangla were won by the team batting second - but their bowlers were wayward on a slow pitch that kept low and had loopy bounce not conducive to shot-making. Shakib wanted to keep India below 260 when he put them in because of the dew factor later in the evening. He watched the target surge past that as <m10>Sehwag and Kohli, who justified his captain's decision to leave out Suresh Raina, dismantled the attack in front of a shell-shocked crowd and powered India to 370</m10>. #p#Bangladesh, however, did not go quietly. Faced with an impossible chase, <m11>Imrul Kayes attacked from the outset</m11> after which Tamim Iqbal and Shakib took charge. They set off at a sprint, swinging fearlessly, edging luckily, and brought cheer to their supporters. What Bangladesh failed to do, though, was sustain the aggression for as long as Sehwag did, and the asking-rate soared irreversibly out of reach. #p#With a withering back-foot drive, <m12>Sehwag had slammed the first ball of the tournament to the cover boundary</m12>, the opening move of his maiden century against Bangladesh silencing a boisterous Mirpur crowd. Shafiul Islam had given Sehwag too much width, and <m13>in his second over he strayed twice on to Sachin Tendulkar's pads</m13> with dire consequences. His day would not get better and <m14>he conceded 69 off seven</m14>. #p#<m15>India raced to 36 after four overs</m15>, forcing Shakib to turn to his premier spinner, Abdur Razzak, in the fifth. <m16>Razzak looped the ball into Sehwag from round the wicket, following the batsman and cramping him for room as he tried to hit inside out through the off side</m16>. <m17>Sehwag had scored 12 off his first six balls and 13 off his next 24</m17>. #p#Bangladesh were listless, though, as Sehwag regained his touch and never lost it again, but they also had some good fortune. A mix-up, during which <m18>both Tendulkar and Sehwag were ball-watching, left both batsmen at one end</m18> and the Mirpur crowd found its voice again. #p#<m19>Sehwag, however, continued piercing gaps and hit the tournament's first six, hoisting Razzak over wide long-on to reach fifty off 45 balls</m19>. <m20>With Gautam Gambhir, Sehwag added 83 to build on the opening stand of 69</m20>. While Sehwag used muscle, Gambhir played with precision - dabbing, pushing and chipping into gaps. <m21>His dismissal for a run-a-ball 39, bowled by a straight one from Mahmudullah</m21>, was against the run of play. #p#The exceptional feature of <m22>Kohli's innings</m22> was his driving. On a surface this slow, he reached the pitch of the ball, gathering momentum with a forward thrust of his body, and drove crisply through the off side with a whip of his wrists. He did it against pace and spin, scoring effortlessly at more than a run a ball. <m23>In the 33rd over, Kohli drove Naeem Islam twice to the cover boundary and pulled him behind square</m23>, placing the ball just wide of the fielders each time. <m24>India took their batting Powerplay after the mandatory ball change and scored 48 for 0</m24> during the fielding restrictions. #p#At one stage Sehwag, who had Gambhir running for him because of an injury, had a shot at a double-century. <m25>He fell in the 48th over</m25>, though, almost making good his pledge to bat through the innings. <m26>Kohli continued to motor towards a hundred in his first World Cup match and got there off the penultimate ball of the innings</m26>, possibly having secured his spot for the rest of the tournament. #p#The pitch quickened in the evening, making shot-making easier, and the dew greased the outfield, making the ball harder to grip. But Bangladesh's bowlers had conceded too much ground for their batsmen to regain. They tried, though, and the initial assault on the Indian bowlers was fierce. #p#The highlight of that brief blitz was the attack on Sreesanth. <m27>Kayes edged, flicked, pulled and drove him for boundaries, and a wayward wide contributed to Bangladesh taking 24 runs off the fifth over</m27>. <m28>They were 51 for 0</m28>. Kayes then tried to force the slower pace of Munaf Patel, who replaced Sreesanth, through the off side and played on, <m29>ending the opening partnership at 56</m29>. #p#Zaheer Khan's control and the introduction of spin resulted in an increase in dot balls and a reduction in boundaries, and by the half-way stage <m30>the asking-rate was already 9.36</m30>. <m31>Tamim and Shakib completed aggressive half-centuries</m31> and the rest of the batsmen also struck the ball fluently during a heartening display. Victory, however, had already escaped them. Bangladesh will hope to reproduce this batting effort in a match in which their bowlers get their act together. #p#Match Timeline
1	501976	Bangladesh v India, World Cup 2011, Mirpur	Sehwag and India make amends	S Rajesh and Madhusudhan Ramakrishnan	February 19, 2011	#p#The contrast between the 2007 World Cup game between Bangladesh and India, and this one, couldn't have been greater. Right from the toss - India had chosen to bat on that occasion - almost everything was completely different between the two games. The biggest difference was Virender Sehwag's performance: in that Trinidad game he scored 2 off 6; <m1>this time he lasted 134 balls more</m1>, and, not surprisingly, that made all the difference. <m2>Sehwag's presence meant India scored far more runs in the first ten overs</m2>, which in turn put pressure on Bangladesh's spinners, who had been completely dominant in Port of Spain. The slow nature of the track meant run-scoring wasn't all that easy in the afternoon, but, as often happens when Sehwag is in this mood, these trivialities didn't matter a jot. #p#Contrast between India's innings in 2007 and 2011 In 2007 In 2011 The toss India chose to bat Bangladesh chose to field <m3>Score after 15 overs 40 for 3 104 for 1</m3> <m4>Dot balls in first 15 overs 73 41</m4> <m5>4s/ 6s in first 15 overs 2/ 0 12/ 1</m5> Performance of Bangladesh spinners 6 for 117 in 30 overs 2 for 238 in 33 overs Performance of Bangladesh fast bowlers 4 for 69 in 19.3 overs 1 for 129 in 17 overs #p#Before the tournament Sehwag spoke about his desire to bat for longer periods, and the manner in which he batted here showed he is serious about implementing those plans. <m6>He faced 140 deliveries in this innings</m6>, which is the most he has ever faced in an ODI innings, beating his earlier record by one ball. In fact, in 223 ODI innings, he has faced more than 120 deliveries only three times, and both the earlier instances were before 2004. #p#The way he paced his innings was interesting: <m7>he started off in a frenzy, scoring 12 off his first six balls</m7>, but then <m8>made only 15 off his next 27</m8>, so that <m9>after the first ten overs he was on a relatively subdued 27 off 33</m9>. <m10>The start of the second Powerplay made him switch gears</m10>, as <m11>he struck four fours off his next six balls</m11>, a sequence that turned the momentum India's way. <m12>At the end of the 33rd, he'd scored 104 off 99</m12>, <m13>before the batting Powerplay helped him move up a further gear, as he scored 33 off 17 balls during this period</m13>. #p#How Sehwag paced his innings First 6 balls Next 27 balls Next 66 balls Last 41 balls Runs scored 12 15 77 71 #p#<m14>The only bowler who controlled the runs against him to some extent was Rubel Hossain, who gave away only 22 off 29 balls</m14>.

Batting first and choking the opposition is your strength. It's a flat pitch. You win the toss. And what do you do? Invite the best batting line-up in subcontinent conditions to bat? Not the way to go. Shakib Al Hasan perhaps let the statistics (in the last two years, 14 of the 19 completed ODIs in Mirpur have been won by the team batting second) sway his choice, but there was a more immediate history that he should have paid heed to. Only earlier in the week they failed miserably chasing 286, in a warm-up match against Pakistan. #p#The start Travelling teams often say the best way to play in the subcontinent is to first silence their crowds. Virender Sehwag applied the principle to India's neighbours. It had been a long and frenzied build-up to the event, and Bangladesh was a potential banana-peel game for India, especially if the crowds got on top of them. <m1>The first ball of the match gave Sehwag the slightest amount of width, and he crashed it past cover for four</m1>. World Cups don't get off to more explosive starts. #p#The cheers The loudest, sustained cheers from a sell-out crowd were sadistic ones. The first was when <m2>Sehwag was hit by a short ball somewhere between his pad and thigh pad</m2>; they went mad as he went down. <m3>Virat Kohli later misread the bounce of another short one, and inside-edged onto the area between his thigh pad and the box</m3>. He bent over in pain, and the roof of the stadium came off again. To rub salt into his wound, the giant screen showed three replays of the hit before the next delivery. Each was greeted by a loud cheer. #p#Those replays were conspicuous in their absence later in the innings when Mushfiqur Rahim was hit in the face by a ball that bounced in front of him. It was in fact the longest period of silence at the Shere Bangla Stadium, as Mushfiqur received treatment. #p#World Cup debut Not long ago, with all the big batting guns expected to be back, it was difficult to see how India would fit Virat Kohli in their first XI for the World Cup. Through sheer weight of runs, though, Kohli forced his way in, denying Suresh Raina a World Cup debut. Not only did Kohli do that, he also made sure it wouldn't be easy to drop him in the near future by <m4>scoring a century</m4> and <m5>adding 203 with Sehwag</m5>. #p#World Cup debut, part II <m6>In the first over of Bangladesh's innings, the UDRS too made its first appearance in a World Cup</m6>. <m7>It was Sreesanth, another Cup debutant, who necessitated its use with a full outswinger that pitched around middle and leg and came in towards Tamim Iqbal's pads</m7>. Kumar Dharmasena, the umpire, ruled it not out, and on first look it seemed that an inside edge may have saved Tamim. After various replays, it was ascertained there was no edge, but Hawk-Eye showed the ball was swinging down the leg side.
1	502010	Bangladesh v India, World Cup 2011, Mirpur	Beware of Sehwag 2.0	Sidharth Monga at the Shere Bangla Stadium	February 19, 2011	By the time <m1>Virender Sehwag was dismissed in the 48th over against Bangladesh, he had made 175</m1>, and taken India past 350 AFP Enlarge Related Links Analysis : Normal service restored, somewhat Report : Sehwag and Kohli sink Bangladesh in opener Audio/Video: 'Sehwag has the will to bat long' Players/Officials: Virender Sehwag Matches: Bangladesh v India at Dhaka Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: India #p#To intimidate people, Al Pacino's character in Scarface made them "say hello to my little friend" Somehow six other words from Virender Sehwag, which sound completely non-violent by his standards, are having similar impact in the cricketing world. Cricket's Tony Montana just said, "I want to bat 50 overs." It is a simple thought, something every opening batsman says by rote, but when Sehwag says that it becomes scary. When Sehwag says he wants to bat 50 overs, you shudder when you think what if he actually bats 50 overs? #p#What if the man - his average innings lasts 32 balls but he has still managed to score more than 7000 runs at a strike-rate over 100 - decides to try and play anything close to 150 deliveries in a match? What if he regularly starts lasting till batting Powerplays? Before today, while batting first, Sehwag had faced 100 balls only on two occasions. What if he starts doing it more often? He has never stayed not out batting first. What if he does that often in completed innings? #p#Today Sehwag gave a glimpse of the possibilities, and on evidence the bowlers need to be afraid. Very afraid. It was fitting that the new Sehwag came out in the same country where four years ago he was trying to figure out just what his role was as a batsman, when he was a confused man after being dropped from Tests, a format in which he has never merited a drop. That was soon after the World Cup debacle. On that tour he got off to two starts, but threw his wicket away on both occasions. Four years on, now one of the most feared batsmen in Test cricket, Sehwag's intentions of making a larger impact in ODIs too have begun in Bangladesh. #p#The ease with which Sehwag did it today made it seem like all he had to do was tell himself he needed to bat longer. <m2>You could see he was fighting boredom in the middle overs when all that was available was singles</m2>. <m3> that will be remembered for all the bat</m3> considered the oxygen of his batting, but that had little effect on him. You could see from his itching to hit that he still didn't think spinners ought to bowl in international cricket, but <m4>he showed restraint when Abdul Razzak came on to bowl in the fifth over</m4>. <m5>He played out four dots in that over before taking the single</m5>. Razzak's time would come later. <m6>The first time Sehwag tried to clear the infield today was in the 15th over, a six over cow corner to reach his fifty  off Razzak</m6>. #p#All this after he had got the World Cup off to a smashing start, with <m7>a punch through the covers first ball</m7> and <m8>a drive for four through the same region in the same over</m8>. You watched with interest just how he would rein himself in after such a start. How would a batsman who knows no boundaries limit himself? Not that he hasn't done that before. He did so to save the Adelaide Test, but then he had a challenge in front of himself, a larger cause of drawing the Test. He did that during a chase in Dambulla last year, scoring 99 not out when every other batsman failed under the lights, but then the conditions provided that extra challenge. #p#One-day cricket on flat tracks, like today, doesn't present that kind of multi-faceted challenge. It was the kind of track and bowling where the only man that could have got Sehwag out was Sehwag himself. He wasn't going to do that today, not until he had reached the back-end of the innings. <m9>In the middle overs, he fought the boredom with chips over extra cover for twos</m9>. He stayed alert to quick singles; on one occasion he ran a bye, and then the overthrow off a ricochet off the stumps when the ball had hardly gone far. #p#Once he reached that back-end, <m10>once he called for the batting Powerplay in the 35th over</m10>, every bowler bar Rubel Hossain - who used the bouncer well on a slow pitch - got the clip. <m11>Shafiul Islam was swung for six over long-on</m11>. <m12>Razzak he treated like a club bowler, leaving his crease every ball, and then deciding which boundary to clear</m12>. Powerful shots, late-cuts, lofts, all came back. #p#With the World Cup upon us, so is Sehwag 2.0. If he can continue doing what he did today, more games will be decided by the end of the first innings.
1	502019	Bangladesh v India, World Cup 2011, Mirpur	Normal service restored, somewhat	Sambit Bal at the Shere Bangla Stadium	February 19, 2011	A large total was mounted by India's batsmen; so large, in fact, that it didn't stretch their bowlers at all AFP Enlarge Related Links Analysis : Beware of Sehwag 2.0 Features : Sehwag and India make amends Report : Sehwag and Kohli sink Bangladesh in opener Matches: Bangladesh v India at Dhaka Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Bangladesh | India #p#The crowd and the stage was befitting of a World Cup opener - and, when the home batsmen sparkled briefly at the beginning of the chase, the atmosphere too - but gradually the inevitable outcome of a gigantic chase homed in, batsmen abandoned the chase and the crowd resigned themselves to cheering the occasional boundary. The streets outside the ground weren't as charged as the night before but the partying continued in Dhaka. It isn't merely about the home team here: the World Cup is the real thing. #p#For the Indians, it went to script. A large total was mounted; so large, in fact, that it didn't stretch their bowlers at all. But the most interesting part of the plot was the unveiling of a new Virender Sehwag, restrained, patient, canny, and hungry. There were glimpses of this during the warm-up games, and he made good his pre-tournament promise to bat long. <m1>This was the longest he has ever batted</m1> in a one-day match, and inevitably it yielded his highest score. The 200 came tantalisingly close but Sehwag never looked over-anxious to get there. Was it because he didn't think it appropriate to take Sachin Tendulkar's record after having run him out? #p#Overall, it was a mighty batting performance by the mightiest batting line-up in this World Cup. The Bangladesh bowling was unthreatening but by no means was the pitch a belter. It was a typical Bangladesh pitch, low and slow. So slow that the real threat to the batsmen came from the risk of indecision. <m2>Bangladesh turned to spin after four overs</m2>, and the ball took so long to arrive that Virender Sehwag could have sung a song before playing it. Runs had to be manoeuvred, not bludgeoned. The Indians did it expertly, skillfully. #p#The wagon wheels tell the story (check out our brilliant new one). <m3>India picked up 152 of their 370 runs in front of the wicket on the onside</m3>. The arc between the bowler and mid-on is among the most difficult scoring areas but, on a pitch where the batsmen were forced to generate their own pace, Indian batsmen drove off the back-foot consummately. Sehwag, of course, hit a few straight down the ground with a flat bat. #p#Uncertain of his place in the XI before the World Cup began, <m4>Virat Kohli has cemented his place at the number four with an exquisite hundred on debut</m4>. By all accounts he is India's most improved batsman in recent years. Sehwag joined the chorus of teammates to speak about his maturity. Recalling that he had thrown away his wicket in the Champions Trophy match against Pakistan in South Africa, Sehwag pointed out that Kohli has scored six hundreds in the ODIs since then. His batting today was perfectly tempered, full of grace and timing and of cover-driving reminiscent of Rahul Dravid. #p#Sreesanth had only the theatrics going for him in a wayward performance AFP Enlarge #p#Bangladesh's decision to bowl was not inexplicable, and Shakib Al Hasan defended it stoutly but did betray diffidence. Two factors would have weighed on Shakib. The dew that tends to set in in the final stages of the match is potentially crippling for his spin-based bowling attack. And historically, most of their wins against top nations, including their two World Cup upsets, have come bowling first. In fact, that's how unfancied team usually sneak a win: they capitalise on opposition batsmen either underestimating their bowlers or just batting badly. #p#Bangladesh have a fair chance of making it to the quarter-finals in this World Cup. But to get there, they would need to believe that they are genuine contenders. They have a largely defensive bowling attack, and they must trust it to defend in these conditions. A team choosing to bowl first expects wickets off its bowlers, and there wasn't a sniff of a wicket-taking ball throughout the Indian innings today. The most sustained cheer from the crowd came when Virat Kohli under-edged a pull to his thigh and winced in pain. As if to keep the spirits going, they replayed the ball four times in quick succession on the giant screen, and the cheers grew louder. But for the most part, the crowd was left to feel the pain inflicted by Indian batsmen. #p#<m5>Abdur Razzak bowled a couple of good overs at the start</m5> and Shakib has developed a fast offside yorker that works at the death but Bangladesh had no option but to wheel away once the Indians got going. <m6>Rubel Hossain alone produced some spunk with clever use of the bouncer</m6> that Sehwag, and later Kohli, found difficult to put away. He went for only six an over despite bowling in all the Powerplays and at the death. #p#India can be relieved to have done the business expected of them but the bowling will remain a worry. They chose Sreesanth ahead of Ashish Nehra, who had been wayward, and <m7>Sreesanth delivered two spells full of sins: too full, too short, too wide, too far down the leg, and predictably a no-ball</m7>. Since playing four specialist bowlers is fundamental to their strategy, and they have nowhere else to look for a fast-bowling option, they might soon need to consider two specialist spinners. #p#On a turning pitch in Bangalore against England, that may not be the worst option.
1	502023	Bangladesh v India, World Cup 2011, Mirpur	Shakib rues profligate fast bowlers	ESPNcricinfo staff	February 19, 2011	#p#Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan has held his fast bowlers responsible for making his decision to insert India backfire spectacularly. #p#"I thought we could have bowled better" Shakib - downcast but not desolate - said. "We bowled too many boundary balls, and that cost us the game." #p#<m1>The opening ball of the World Cup, short and wide from Shafiul Islam, yielded a boundary as Virender Sehwag crunched it through extra cover</m1>. <m2>Shafiul went on to concede eight more runs in his first over, including a four off the last ball</m2>. <m3>By the end of the third over, the Indian openers had hit six boundaries and raced to 32</m3>. <m4>It led to the introduction of spin in the fifth over</m4>. #p#"I thought we had a better chance of winning the game chasing," Shakib said repeatedly. "It would have been a different game had we got two early wickets. That was our plan. Our fast bowlers didn't execute the plan, that was the main problem. #p#"I thought our fast bowlers have been bowling really well for the last 12 months. Today wasn't their day but hopefully they will come back strongly." #p#He said he was satisfied, however, with the effort with the bat <m5>despite his team finishing 87 runs short of the target</m5>. "The plan was to bat properly, playing cricketing shots. We knew the wicket was good, and if one of Tamim (Iqbal) and Junaid (Siddique) had kept going, we could have got a very good total. #p#"That was our plan, and I thought we executed our plan very well. We didn't try to hit too many slogs, we played all cricketing shots, and got close to 300. I thought we batted really well and sensibly." #p#He refused to be drawn into discussing the non-selection of Mohammad Ashraful, who has spent more time on the bench than in the playing XI under his captaincy, and to a pointed question on whether he had a problem with the senior players, his response was a cryptic and dismissive "no comments."
1	502030	Bangladesh v India, World Cup 2011, Mirpur	'I didn't think about the double-century' - Sehwag	Sidharth Monga at the Shere Bangla Stadium	February 19, 2011	#p#Virender Sehwag might have taken extra care to make sure he batted deep into India's innings at Mirpur, but when it comes to his press conferences, middle overs continue to remain conspicuous in their absence. He talks like he bats, and after <m1>his 175 - his longest one-day innings in terms of runs, balls faced, and overs elapsed</m1> - his reaction was: "I am happy that at least once in my career I have batted 47 overs." That was followed by a warning: "I was planning to bat 50 overs. I couldn't do that, but hopefully I will do so in coming games." #p#That came moments after a similarly forthright show at the presentation ceremony, where he said, "Everyone did well, other than Sreesanth." He also said this was a grudge match after India's defeat to Bangladesh in the 2007 World Cup, something not many like to admit. He also maintained that Bangladesh are not a good Test side. "They can compete in ODIs, but today they could not." #p#Inside the press-conference room, the fun continued. <m2>The mix-up with Sachin Tendulkar, which resulted in the latter's run-out</m2>, was delightfully explained. "We discussed we will take it easy on singles," Sehwag said. "He was calling, and I was not listening, and I was looking at the ball, yeah. For a fraction of a second I thought I had made a mistake, but you know when I went to the dressing room, he said, 'It's okay. What's important is to win the game for the country. It's not important who is performing.'" #p#In Christchurch, in 2009, when Tendulkar retired hurt on 163 at the end of the 45th over, Sehwag told him he had missed out on a double-century. At 175 in the 47th over, Sehwag said he himself didn't think of that mark. "Not at all. When he came back not out, eight or nine overs were left. When I came back, three overs were left, and I still had 25 to get. I would have had to play 15 out of those 18 balls, so I wasn't thinking of the double-hundred. My target was to bat 50 overs, no matter how much I score." #p#His own innings, Sehwag termed the most satisfactory "as far as overs are concerned" It was obviously a conscious effort to play a longer innings, and take fewer chances. One of the bigger challenges of such innings is the middle overs, when fields are spread. Sehwag said his plan was to concentrate on taking singles. "It was easy for me to rotate the strike. <m3>I think I hit a six on 49</m3>, and <m4>after that till 75 or 80 I was just rotating the strike </m4>because I knew I had to play 30-40 overs, and if I do that I would get a hundred. Still my strike rate was more than 100." #p#There was praise for the other centurion, Virat Kohli, and not just hollow praise, but analytical appreciation. "Whenever we spoke in the middle, we told each other to not throw our wickets away. I still remember against Pakistan in the Champions Trophy [in Centurion, in 2009], he was playing well, but he played a shot straight to long-off. After that he has scored six hundreds. Sometimes a little nudge is enough for some people. He is a quick learner, and a mature batsman." #p#The last question to him was if he feels any pressure from the pundits that he is most crucial to India's prospects in the World Cup. Sehwag's dead-pan reply was, "My job is to play and make runs."

Kenya come across as the whipping boys of the group, along with Canada, but a demoralised New Zealand are ripe for the picking. New Zealand have come off a humiliating loss to India in their warm-up game and three consecutive bilateral ODI series defeats at the hands of Bangladesh, India and Pakistan, so the need to show some intent is pressing. #p#New Zealand have gone from being one of the sides that was always there and thereabouts to the forgotten men of international competitions but given the format of this World Cup, they have almost no excuse to not make it to the quarter-finals. #p#The World Cup is Daniel Vettori's last international series as captain; he would like to leave a lasting impression and he has the personnel to help him do that. The middle order is New Zealand's marshmallow and if they can firm up that section, they should be able to pull off a decent all-round performance. They will be the team the minnows are targetting in this group and in order to restore self belief they could do with a solid win under their belts. #p#For Kenya, a win over any side will do and beating a full member will be punching above their weight. A close defeat to the Netherlands in their second warm-up illustrated what they are capable of with both bat and ball. The top five batsmen are all capable of getting big scores with Seren Waters leading the line-up. Their string of medium pacers have been economical and effective and if they can capitalise on the mentorship they've been receiving from people like the Kirsten brothers and Jonty Rhodes, they may have a rabbit or two to pull out of the hat. #p#Form guide (Most recent first) #p#New Zealand: WLLLW Kenya: WLWLL #p#Pitch and conditions #p#The Chennai pitch worried South Africa captain Graeme Smith despite his team cantering to an eight-wicket win in a warm-up game against Zimbabwe last week. There doesn't appear to be too much life in it, for either the seamers or the spinners and the batsmen are the ones who could benefit the most. It is likely to be a hot day in Chennai, but the heat should be tempered somewhat by some cloud cover. #p#Watch out for  #p#One of the most exciting young batsmen to come out of Kenya in a while, Alex Obanda is a strokeplayer, who will probably open the innings. His shots are as flamboyant as his frosted hairstyle, and Kenya will look to him as the ideal foil for more circumspect opening partner, Waters, to attack the new ball and score boundaries with the field up. #p#Injuries and dwindling confidence have taken some of the spark out of Jacob Oram's gameplay in recent times, but there is no doubting his talent and if New Zealand are going to get out of their slump and be serious contenders in this tournament, they need a fit and firing Oram in the lower middle order. He didn't have much impact in New Zealand's warm-ups, scoring 17 runs in two innings and picking up two expensive wickets, and a return to form is well overdue. #p#Team news #p#Offspinner Nathan McCullum spent Thursday and Friday night in hospital after being admitted with high fever. He participated in a light training session on Saturday but remains a doubtful starter. Luke Woodcock may play in his place but that would keep a batsman out of the side. Should New Zealand opt for the extra batsmen, like Jamie How, they may find themselves a bowler short. #p#New Zealand (probable): 1 Martin Guptill, 2 Brendan McCullum, 3 Jessie Ryder, 4 Ross Taylor, 5 James Franklin, 6 Scott Stryis, 7 Jacob Oram, 8 Daniel Vettori, 9 Luke Woodcock, 10 Kyle Mills, 11 Tim Southee #p#Kenya have had a fairly settled unit in recent times, and without any injuries to worry them, the playing XI practically picks itself.

2	501959	Kenya v New Zealand, World Cup 2011, Chennai	Kamande wants Kenya to express themselves	Sriram Veera in Chennai	February 19, 2011	#p#Jimmy Kamande, the Kenya captain, belied the occasion of a pre-game World Cup conference; his demeanour suggested he was at a party. The shoulders were relaxed, the eyes smiled naughtily, the legs dangled to an inner tune and the mouth was curved into an ever-present smile. There was an easy, joyous gaiety about him. He spoke confidently, said the right things and looked the part of a captain of an associate team who knew the pressure would be on his bigger opponents. However, you could sense a quiet determination to prove that they belonged at this level. There was even a bit of bravado. "Any team that will take us lightly will do so at their own peril," Kamande said. Not the usual, "we are here to learn" sound bytes from him that you might expect from a smaller team like Kenya. Kamande, and by extension Kenya, seem to favour flamboyance. They will now have to walk the talk. #p#Ever since the peak of 2003, when they reached the semi-finals, Kenya have been slowly slipping out of the radar. Steve Tikolo, the 39-year old former captain, saw it as a management failure. "The management let us down after our performance in that World Cup. While most teams would use the platform to take the leap into the next level and try to get Test status, we remained an associate nation," Tikolo said. "There is definitely a lack of talent at the grassroots level but that has more to do with financial limitations more than anything else. At present not too many people are keen to play cricket in Kenya." #p#This tournament gives them an opportunity to wow and lure young kids back to the game. Tomorrow is not just another day and Kenya know it. "If we can upset New Zealand, and beat Canada and Zimbabwe, we can be in the second round," Tikolo said. #p#The captain feels they couldn't have prepared better. "I doubt whether the Test teams are working on some of the areas that we have been. We have been working very hard for the last few months or so. In this tournament the top 14 countries in the world are competing and nobody should be taken lightly. The results will talk about our performance at the end of the day." Kenya's preparations indeed have been pretty elaborate. They played a few games in Ahmedabad and Vadodara in India in January, trained in Nairobi, and had a conditioning camp at the ICC High Performance Centre in Dubai. They beat Ireland and Netherlands in Dubai and had a couple of tightly fought warm-up games in Colombo. The batting, led by Tikolo and the young Seren Waters, looks promising and it remains to be seen how the bowlers fare. #p#"What I have seen from my side these days is that we have improved on the batting side and on the bowling side they are coming up together," Kamande said. "We want to play to our potential and enjoy ourselves and the results will take care of itself." #p#It was a common theme through the conference. "Self-expression, enjoy, be our selves, and play our brand of cricket" were some of the words Kamande used frequently. Asked to define their brand of cricket, Kamande tilted his head, stared at the questioner and said with a smile, "Please watch us over the next few games. We are well organized and prepared. We will just go there and express ourselves whether New Zealand or any other teams come our way. We will enjoy ourselves and not to copy any team. Best thing is to watch us tomorrow."
2	501974	Kenya v New Zealand, World Cup 2011, Chennai	Vettori calls for intensity ahead of 'must-win' game	Sriram Veera in Chennai	February 19, 2011	#p#These are desperate times for New Zealand. On better days, a game against Kenya should not be a thing to be fussed about and they would actually be worrying how not to get complacent ahead of the contest. Instead, they feel the pressure of a "must-win game" "Intensity will be even bigger because this is a must win game for us," Daniel Vettori said. "We will be strong and play well." #p#For the past few months, New Zealand have been psyching themselves to look to the future. The recent past has been dispiriting: a whitewash in Bangladesh, losses in India, defeats against Pakistan at home, and a soul-crushing pasting against India in the warm-up game. Gloom shadowed them everywhere. Harsh criticism floated up first: "We batted like dicks," was the frank assessment of the then coach Mark Greatbach. Saner post-mortem followed with the inclusion of John Wright as the new coach. The losses continued, meanwhile. #p#Brendon McCullum recently agreed to the assessment that they had forgotten how to win. Will tomorrow's game against Kenya be the first step out of the sordid mess or a further slide into the abyss? Daniel Vettori, the captain, tried to sound positive in the pre-game conference. "We are sure to up our confidence levels after our match tomorrow. It is quite a fluid concept when we play bigger teams but our guys have the abilities to bounce back. But I prefer to look at that rather than dwelling on the past." #p#The past though couldn't be shoved under the carpet. "We acknowledge the comments [about New Zealand being low on confidence] since we lost a lot of games in recent times and they were disappointing performances, particularly in the sub-continent, but hope we can look at the World Cup as a fresh start." #p#The first game against Kenya shouldn't be difficult to win but Vettori, understandably, chose to be cautious. "The hardest thing about playing a qualifier is that you do not see much of them. Some of their players will be a bit of a surprise. You prepare may be after seeing them on television. In a way it is a challenge but it does not matter as we got to turn up and play tomorrow." It's something they haven't done well in the recent past. #p#Things could kickstart if the batsmen start performing. A line-up that reads Brendon McCullum, Jesse Ryder, Ross Taylor, an in-form Martin Guptill, Scott Styris and Jacob Oram should make the Kenyans sweat. Even in the defeat against India in the warm-up game, the way Brendon and Guptill batted against the seamers would have given a lot of heart to New Zealand fans. It's their batting against spin that has let them down. And their bowling. #p#The bowlers, especially the seamers, have been so lacklustre that Vettori was prompted to say that their bowling coach Allan Donald "is even now bowling better than all fast bowlers" It was meant to be a compliment to Donald but it didn't seem way off the mark. "We have fixed too much on batting and that does not give us enough in bowling," Vettori said. "Allan has been an exciting addition to the team because he is bringing obviously his own personal skills and his own confidence. Ever since he came on board, he speaks with a position of authority to our players and the guys listen when he says what it takes to succeed in the sub-continent and other parts of the world." #p#New Zealand have a selection worry ahead of the game as Nathan McCullum is a doubtful starter after running high temperature yesterday and being kept under observation in an hospital. He returned for a light training session this morning but it's unlikely they will take a risk by playing him against Kenya. "As of now, we plan to play three pacers and two spinners. It depends on Nathan's fitness. We will play two spinners and look at the possibilities in balancing if the third one is coming in. I think there is plenty of runs on the track, if you bowl well, you can restrict the batting side. Generally, it is a batting wicket. It is incredibly difficult for the fast bowlers on these kinds of wickets to make their presence felt." For New Zealand's sake, they must.

The new ball barely deviated off the straight for Southee but Kenya's young opening pair, perhaps over-awed by the occasion, remained nervously rooted to the crease. <m13>They had cobbled together just 14 runs - all in singles</m13> - when <m14>Southee nipped one off the seam to strike Alex Obanda in front of leg stump</m14>. #p#Umpire Marais Erasmus' decision initially looked a good one, but there was a hint that a review might have been in order. The Kenyans were, of course, unfamiliar with the UDRS but that provides no excuse for Obanda's tame acceptance of his demise as replays showed that the ball would have gone over the top of the stumps by at least an inch or two. #p#With the innings drifting swiftly into mediocrity <m15>Collins Obuya got going with a couple of meaty blows off Nathan McCullum</m15>, who opened the bowling from the other end, but just as he and Waters were starting to gain momentum Bennett was introduced and soon had the innings in disarray. First, he fired one full and straight at Waters, the ball shooting through at a low shin height to pin the batsman in front of his stumps. #p#Smart stats <m16>Kenya's total of 69</m16> is by far their lowest in World Cup games - it's their first sub-100 total in 24 games. They lasted 23.5 overs, which is the lowest for them. It's also the fifth-lowest total in World Cups. Canada's 36 against Sri Lanka in 2003 is the lowest. For the first time in a World Cup match, New Zealand dismissed a team for less than 100. The previous lowest against New Zealand in a full 50-over match had been Bangladesh's 116 in 1999. New Zealand won the match with 252 balls to spare, which is their most comprehensive World Cup win - and the third-best for all teams in World Cups - in terms of balls remaining. In all ODIs, it's New Zealand's second-most emphatic win. <m17>Hamish Bennett's 4 for 16</m17> is his best ODI figures, bettering the 4 for 46 he had achieved against Pakistan in his previous ODI. #p#There would have been high hopes in the Kenyan camp of Steve Tikolo, their veteran batsman, sparking a revival but <m18>he was swiftly removed by a searing full delivery that burst through a lazy swish to make a mess of his stumps</m18>. With the ball keeping low and starting to nip off the seam <m19>Obuya was the next batsman to be rapped on the front pad, right in front of middle</m19>. Perhaps out of desperation, a completely superfluous review was called for but there was no second life for Obuya and the innings sank even further when <m20>Maurice Ouma was dispatched in identical fashion in Bennett's next over </m20>to leave <m21>Kenya staring into the abyss at 49 for 5</m21>. #p#<m22>That soon become 59 for 6</m22>, <m23>Jacob Oram finding the edge of Kamande's bat to end his brief resistance</m23>, and with that the fight went from Kenya's innings. <m24>Oram had Thomas Odoyo, who was fending at a rising delivery, easily caught by Jesse Ryder</m24> and <m25>Southee was on a hat-trick when he removed Nehemiah Odhiambo and Shem Ngoche with the last two balls of his sixth over</m25>. There was no second international hat-trick for him, however, with <m26>Elijah Otieno flicking Oram straight to midwicket shortly afterwards to end a miserable Kenyan innings</m26>. #p#Guptill took the lead as <m27>New Zealand completed the formality of the chase in just eight overs, thrashing two enormous sixes and peppering the boundary almost at will in a 32-ball 39</m27>. An uninspired <m28>McCullum chipped in with a rapid 26</m28> as Kenya at least attempted to remain upbeat in the field despite the futility of their efforts. #p#While New Zealand would have been hoping for a successful start to their campaign, the ease of their win here is hardly the best preparation for sterner challenges ahead against the likes of Australia, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. For Kenya, things can only get better after a day they would dearly like to forget, though their performance won't have done any favours to the argument that Associate nations deserve to be involved in future World Cups. #p#Match Timeline

It came from Jacob Oram after <m1>he removed Elijah Otieno</m1> to bowl out Kenya. He immediately turned, put his hand up and grinned sheepishly at Tim Southee, who smiled. <m2>Southee had just taken two wickets in two balls at the end of the previous over</m2>. <m3>Oram's wicket</m3> had denied him a crack at bagging a hat-trick. #p#The disappointment of the day.

Martin Guptill might not be as famous as a Brendon McCullum or Ross Taylor but there aren't many batsmen in the world who can loft the ball to the straight boundary cleaner than him. <m8>He set himself perfectly in the fifth over to launch an Odoyo delivery behind the sightscreen.</m8>
2	502119	Kenya v New Zealand, Group A, World Cup 2011, Chennai	'The young boys were nervous' - Kamande	Sriram Veera at the MA Chidambaram Stadium	February 20, 2011	#p#It was a sombre press conference. Jimmy Kamande, the Kenya captain, was in the hot seat and a New Zealand journalist couldn't resist asking the question. "Yesterday, you said you guys will express yourself and play the Kenyan brand of cricket. How does that comment sit now after today's performance?" #p#To his credit, Kamande didn't stutter or squirm but responded immediately, "Ya, we didn't express ourselves. The young boys were nervous. The two young lads who opened were a bit nervous but Collins Obuya was positive and we were gaining momentum but quick wickets in the middle set us back. In the next few games, we will express ourselves. The good thing is that this is done. It's out of the way. " #p#For what it's worth, it was out of the way very quickly. There was almost an inner conflict when watching the game and it was visible in the audience, at least in the press box. Some sniggered as the wickets tumbled, some were sympathetically silent and some were condescendingly quiet. A few wondered whether the ICC will get further ammunition to keep the minnows out of the next competition. #p#Kamande didn't want to get drawn into that debate but said Kenya will try their best to improve and gently suggested that it was the reverse that was in fact the reason for the debacle. "It's for ICC to decide to play 10 teams or 15... The disappointing thing is we get to play a Test team once around every two years or so. The more we play against these guys, the better you become. We play Pakistan next. I would be happy as long as we improve each and every game." #p#Today, perhaps, it was just the nerves. There was also a matter of skill. <m1>New Zealand, Hamish Bennett in particular, hurled it fast and full</m1> and the Kenya batsmen played around the ball, across the line. There is a huge difference between playing the ball late and being late on the ball. Kenya did the latter and crumbled. "It wasn't as if the ball was doing much but the lines and lengths were tight and some of our batsmen played too much across the line. We will go back and work on it. Next game, different opposition and it will be a different approach from us." #p#While Kenya and their fans, and their critics, will wait to see what unfurls in the future, it was time to breathe easy for New Zealand. It was the perfect way to start a tournament for a team that has been stumbling from one disaster to another. "We didn't expect that the game would get over so quickly," Vettori said. "It was nice. We are happy with how we performed. We don't expect all other matches to be this easier. I think bowling full and straight is going to be the key in this part of world. We will keep the same intensity for every game." #p#Bennett, the wrecker in chief, said he came to know he would be playing after Kyle Mills had an injury problem in the pre-match training session. I just said to myself that I will go straight, try to bowl hard and full to skid off the wicket and catch the pads of batsmen. Coming in as a replacement for the injured Mills in the playing XI, it was a good result for me. Hopefully, I can keep pushing for my selection" #p#New Zealand will hope the bowlers can hold their nerves against tougher opposition, Kenya that batsmen shed their nervousness quickly. There was evidence, even in this debacle, that they have a couple of batsmen who have the flair to provide some fun moments for their fans. As the tournament tagline says, this is the cup that counts, and it would be a pity if we don't get to see the Kenyans play with a bit more freedom.

With a team forged around much of the same group of players that made it to the final in the Caribbean last time around, Sri Lanka start as one of the tournament's fancied sides. Canada - a team of immigrants, expats and five home-grown former Under-19 stars - have had a good run in the warm-up against Netherlands and England but will need a World Cup miracle to beat Kumar Sangakkara's side. #p#Sri Lanka's home record is imposing but the surroundings of Hambantota are almost as unfamiliar to them as they are to the visitors. A new pitch at a new stadium, the captains have been keen to praise the look of both. The state of pitches at this tournament is already shaping up into a bone of contention, and set against the fiasco at Eden Gardens, the Sri Lankan board should be credited for getting the stadium ready in time. #p#The last time these two met in the World Cup, Canada slumped to the lowest World Cup score in history. The entire cricketing infrastructure in Canada has improved since then, with players centrally contracted for the first time and big sponsors like Reebok jumping on board. Upsets have been hard-wired out of the format for this World Cup, and with the ICC taking it a step further next time by expelling Associate nations altogether, a competitive show from Canada would do wonders to the minnows' case for inclusion. #p#Form guide (Most recent first) #p#Sri Lanka: WWLWW Canada: LWWWL #p#Pitch and conditions #p#The Mahinda Rajapaksa International Stadium has not yet hosted a full international match so the pitch in Hambantota is something of an unknown quantity.

After practicing at the ground Sangakkara was happy, saying "the wicket looked fantastic and the conditions were beautiful for cricket" The Sri Lankan weather has been anything but for recent series and there were a few clouds circling on the eve of the game, which could mean an early outing for Duckworth and Lewis, in their fourth World Cup. #p#Watch out for  #p#There is still something about the 50-over format that promotes unqualified utility players, who are unable to hold their place in either discipline.

Teams: Canada | Sri Lanka #p#For the many who slammed the ICC's decision to expel Associates from the next World Cup, this was a bad day. After Kenya were embarrassed by a modest New Zealand team, Canada desperately needed to showcase why minnow teams belong on the global stage. Instead they were overwhelmed by 210 runs against Sri Lanka, who opened their World Cup campaign as emphatically as their co-hosts India did on Saturday. #p#<m8>Mahela Jayawardene stroked his way to the fastest World Cup hundred</m8> by a Sri Lankan, <m9>sharing a 179-run stand with his captain Kumar Sangakkara</m9>, before the home side's pace bowlers rushed through a hapless Canadian line-up to deliver a crushing victory. #p#After India's fervoured opening in Mirpur, proceedings at Hambantota felt much more leisurely, and with a combination of sight screen problems and a few injuries, it took the visitors four hours to get through their fielding effort. <m10>For the first 20 overs of Sri Lanka's innings the scoring rate was almost as sluggish</m10> - despite <m11>a 59-ball half-century for Tillakaratne Dilshan</m11> - as Canada demonstrated the ideal model for Associate cricket. Disciplined dobbers combined with swift fielding and a slowish track to keep Sri Lanka in check. #p#<m12>It was only when Jayawardene arrived that Sri Lanka's campaign really kicked into gear</m12>. He was in total control, threading the spinners through the finest gaps and caressing boundaries at will. <m13>Sangakkara was not quite as fluent, needing 47 deliveries to find his first boundary</m13>. He survived two moments of alarm, when <m14>he was dropped on 12 by by 16-year-old Nitish Kumar</m14>, on as a substitute, and <m15>again on 48 by the rotund legspinner Balaji Rao</m15>. #p#<m16>Jayawardene barely mistimed a ball but twice survived reviews from Canada captain Ashish Bagai, who was convinced he was out caught behind</m16>. On both occasions the appeal was spontaneous and exuberant but the UDRS - without Snicko and HotSpot - revealed nothing. With those behind him, Jayawardene's glances, chips, pick-up-sweeps and even a reverse-thwack toyed with an attack that faded under pressure. #p#Smart Stats. <m17>Sri Lanka's 332</m17> is their second highest score in World Cup matches, behind their 398 against Kenya in Kandy in 1996. It is also the second highest score against Canada in World Cups behind New Zealand's 363 in 2007. <m18>Mahela Jayawardene scored his century off 80 balls</m18>, making it the fastest century in World Cups by a Sri Lankan batsman. The previous record was held by Sanath Jayasuriya, who scored his century off 85 balls against Bangladesh in the 2007 World Cup. <m19>With their ninth century partnership, Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara</m19> went past the pairing of Aravinda de Silva and Arjuna Ranatunga, who have eight century stands in ODIs. They are now second only to Jayasuriya and Marvan Atapattu, who have 14 century partnerships. <m20>The 179-run partnership between Sangakkara and Jayawardene</m20> is the second highest third-wicket partnership for Sri Lanka in World Cup matches. Sri Lanka posted their sixth score over 300 in World Cups, which is second only to Australia, who have 13 scores over 300. Three of Sri Lanka's 300-plus scores came in the 2007 World Cup. The 210 run victory margin is Sri Lanka's second highest in World Cup matches and the seventh highest overall in World Cup matches. #p#There was no route back for Canada as the pair cashed in against a tiring attack. It's becoming one of cricket's more quirky stats that Sangakkara can't seem to reach three figures in ODI cricket anymore. His last century was in June 2008 and he has now gone 60 matches without a hundred, despite scoring heavily over the period. #p#He had the ideal opportunity today, but inexplicably popped <m21>a gentle return catch to John Davison when eight runs short</m21>. By this stage the only trouble for Jayawardene was the heat and he looked exhausted as he crawled the single to bring up his record-breaking century. #p#While victory was always going to be beyond them, a competitive showing with the bat would have lifted the spirits of a dank World Cup day but Canada's top order folded against a sparky new-ball pairing. <m22>The hulking Thislan Perera proved too quick for John Davison and Zubin Sukari</m22> <m23>before returning later to snare Bagai</m23>. The looming threat of rain forced Sangakkara to swap seam for spin to rush to 20 overs - the minimum needed to constitute a match - but once that threat cleared Sri Lanka's job was as good as done. #p#At 40, Davison has had plenty of experience but appears to be trading off the World Cup century he made eight years ago. In the build-up Canada were keen to point to the clutch of youngsters who had come through their Under-19s side but come the day Kumar and Hiral Patel - their two bright batting talents - were left out. After today's showing both can expect to make their senior World Cup debuts soon. #p#<m24>Rizwan Cheema offered a glimpse of the big-hitting</m24> that gave England a fright but by that stage that game was meandering towards the inevitable. After two matches and two crushing defeats, the Associates are doing the ICC's case no harm at all. #p#Match Timeline
3	502188	Sri Lanka v Canada, Group A, World Cup 2011, Hambantota	The fans turn up...and so does an elephant	Osman Samiuddin in Hambantota	February 20, 2011	There was plenty of support for the home side despite the long journey. Manoj Ridimahaliyadda. Enlarge Related Links. Matches: Sri Lanka v Canada at Hambantota. Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup. Teams: Canada | Sri Lanka #p#Start of the day. Having overcome so many hurdles to get ready for the country's opening match of the World Cup - venue being a jungle just a couple of years back, unexpectedly heavy rains hampering work, unhappy inspection teams to name just three - it was somehow fitting that the start of the game would be further delayed. <m1>Upul Tharanga had to wait an extra ten minutes to face the game's first ball from Khurram Chohan</m1>: of all the things that could go wrong, the culprit was a minor sightscreen malfunction. The devil clearly is in the detail. #p#Memo of the day. To boards, ICC and broadcasters: The UDRS without HotSpot is like, well, a World Cup without the world. <m2>Twice in successive overs from Jimmy Hansra, Canada was convinced Mahela Jayawardene had edged behind.</m2> HotSpot comes into its own particularly for edges. Slo-mo replays suggested the first one might've been a good shout; HotSpot would've confirmed it. #p#Appearance of the day. The district of Hambantota, to the tourist, can appear a quiet, isolated one. Sixty kilometers to and from the stadium can pass with few souls spotted; at night, you can go without seeing anyone. SLC had announced in advance 35,000 people would be turning up and for a couple of days, it didn't look like there were that many in the region. Yet on match day, in they came, in huge numbers, some from 50-60km away. By midway through Sri Lanka's innings, the general stands and grass embankments were packed with life. #p#Appearance of the day II. The elephant that ambled up outside the stadium near the southern entrance. Really. Clearly he didn't seem much that interested him and he was soon off, ambling away. #p#Drop of the day. Canada dropped a couple of chances in the field but as the minnows are being given such a tough time on and off the field, we thought of picking on Thilan Samaraweera for the sake of balance. And <m3>the chance, waist-high at second slip from the first ball Zubin Surkari faced, was simple enough</m3> that, dare we say it, a Canadian would've held it. #p#Run of the day. Tyson Gordon's international debut wasn't a particularly memorable one. In attempting a run-out from point he injured his ankle and had to go off. <m4>He came out to bat later with a runner and off his first ball clipped the ball elegantly to deep square-leg. And set off for a run, getting halfway down before remembering someone was there to do that for him.</m4> #p#Run of the day II. Henry Osinde, Canada's big, burly fast bowler, pulled up with what appeared to be a hamstring strain early in his spell when Sri Lanka batted. After a break for treatment, he tried to run in again, stopped and slowly trudged off the field not to reappear again. He wasn't expected to bat, but he gamely came out as last man... without a runner; and duly <m5>jogged a comfortable single from the very first ball he faced</m5>. #p#Shot of the day. Whenever Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene score runs you can be guaranteed a fine, vast array of strokes. But for sheer chutzpah the shot of the day came from Canada's own Boom Boom, Rizwan Cheema. He'd already clubbed a couple of boundaries when Muttiah Muralitharan came on. <m6>The very first ball he faced from him, he lofted him over extra cover for six.</m6> As you do.
3	502226	Sri Lanka v Canada, Group A, World Cup 2011, Hambantota	Stripped down UDRS under the spotlight	Osman Samiuddin in Hambantota	February 20, 2011	Canada had no luck with the UDRS when they were in the field. Associated Press Enlarge Related Links. Players/Officials: Ashish Bagai | Mahela Jayawardene. Matches: Sri Lanka v Canada at Hambantota. Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Canada | Sri Lanka #p#The unavailability of Hot Spot technology during the current World Cup came under scrutiny as co-hosts Sri Lanka opened their World Cup campaign with a thumping win over Canada today at Hambantota. #p#<m1>Mahela Jayawardene, Man of the Match for his 100</m1>, was the focus of <m2>two referrals from Canada for caught behind decisions</m2>, both of which went against the minnows. First, <m3>in the 23rd over with Jayawardene on 11, spinner Jimmy Hansra and wicketkeeper-captain Ashish Bagai went up for a huge appeal convinced an edge had been pouched</m3>. #p#The umpire turned it down, but Canada went for an immediate referral. TV replays suggested an edge, but were ultimately inconclusive and the decision remained. Then, <m4>in Hansra's very next over, they went up as Jayawardene attempted a drive. Again the umpire turned it down only for the second referral to be called and again TV replays failed to provide a decisive picture.</m4> #p#In October last year, the ICC had announced that Hot Spot cameras would be used in the semi-finals and final of the tournament. But an ICC spokesman later told ESPNcricinfo that, "the supplier of the Hot Spot technology advised that it was not willing to supply its cameras for the tournament so, accordingly, they will not be used at any stage in the tournament." #p#Though Jayawardene was potentially a beneficiary of the absence of Hot Spot, he said later that it was a concern not having it. "I think that's probably the downside to it and I don't think they have Snicko either. I am a big fan of the UDRS, I think if we have technology and if we can use it in a certain way we should." #p#The UDRS, in its current form, is reduced to its most basic requirements: a ball-tracker (Hawk-Eye), super slo-mo camera, and a 'clear' stump mic, none of which are particularly helpful with edges. "I think you need to make sure that fair decisions are being made and we need to help the umpires especially because in the conditions it's not easy for them to make correct decisions all the time," Jayawardene said. "There's more technology possible so we should use that." #p#<m5>Canada did make successful use of one referral when they batted, Bagai winning a decision in his favour after he had been given leg-before to Muttiah Muralitharan</m5>. "For us, this was the first time we were playing under that rule and our guys were not experienced with it," Canada coach Pubudu Dassanayake said. "Definitely without Hot Spot you can't take proper decisions for caught behinds."
3	502229	Sri Lanka v Canada, World Cup 2011, Hambantota	Jayawardene says there is still work ahead	Sa'adi Thawfeeq in Hambantota	February 20, 2011	#p#Mahela Jayawardene, the Sri Lanka vice-captain, said he was pleased with Sri Lanka's start to the World Cup but there was still a lot of hard work ahead of his team in the tournament. <m1>Jayawardene scored the fastest century by a Sri Lanka player in any World Cup, when he got to the landmark off 80 balls in their first game of the tournament</m1>, against Canada in Hambantota on Sunday. The previous fastest hundred was off 85 balls by Sanath Jayasuriya, against Bangladesh in 2007. #p#"We had a few nerves before the game started, just to get on with the World Cup in front of our own crowd," Jayawardene said. "It's not easy to play a team like Canada. You've got to make sure that you come in prepared. It's a good start but we've got a lot of hard work ahead of us with other teams." #p#After electing to bat, <m2>Sri Lanka had got off to a relatively sluggish start, with the scoring rate having dipped below five runs an over by the time Jayawardene came in</m2>. He credited Canada's bowlers for that, but said it was always the plan to keep wickets in hand. #p#"To be fair on the Canadian side they bowled really well. They bowled in good areas to start off with, and [Tillakaratne] Dilshan couldn't get away and neither did Upul [Tharanga], but it was important for us to keep wickets in hand. We had a good <m3>partnership between Kumar [Sangakkara] and me</m3>. We needed to change that rhythm a bit in the middle overs and we managed to do that and took control of the game." #p#<m4>After Jayawardene was dismissed to a tired shot just after he got his century</m4>, <m5>Sri Lanka lost some quick wickets in the end overs</m5>, sparking further doubts over their inexperienced middle order, which is considered one of the few weaknesses they have in their side. Jayawardene, however, praised the middle order for doing what he described as "dirty work" in going after the bowlers rather than trying to preserve their wickets. #p#"We can't blame those guys because they went on to accelerate and obviously we will lose a few wickets in that situation. There was another case where we could have taken a run a ball and probably got 300 and would have been happy. But the guys are doing some dirty work for us so and we need to appreciate that. #p#"When the right time comes, as we saw in the warm-up game against West Indies , the middle order clicked, and in the other warm-up against Holland too, we batted very well. Everyone's got a role to play in our team and according to the situations they will come up and play those roles. There is no point just going out there and blocking the ball and not getting out. It's all about doing the job for the team." #p#Sri Lanka are one of the hosts of the tournament but have not had a chance to play an ODI at two of their new stadiums - the Mahinda Rajapaksa International Cricket Stadium in Hambantota and the Pallekele International Cricket Stadium - but Jayawardene said they were happy with the time they got to practice in Hambantota. "The first couple of practice sessions we had [in Hambantota], we realised the wickets were really good. Everything went smoothly for us. From the players point of view there are no complaints. We knew we could score 250 to 300 on this wicket." #p#Sri Lanka's strong batting performance on Sunday was backed up by an equally impressive showing by the bowlers, even in the absence of Lasith Malinga. Jayawardene confirmed Malinga's absence was just precautionary and said he would play in their next game, against Pakistan on February 26. #p#"Lasith had a bit of a back strain. He played in the West Indies game as well so we didn't want to risk him. He bowled yesterday and he was okay but given the fact that we have got a couple of crucial games coming up we thought that he should get a break. He'll get into his stride in the next few days and should be okay for the Pakistan game."
3	502234	Sri Lanka v Canada, World Cup 2011, Hambantota	Where do the minnows go from here?	Osman Samiuddin in Hambantota	February 20, 2011	#p#Such days make for a dispiriting - and complicated - spectacle. The two matches in Chennai and Hambantota on Sunday are precisely what the format and the World Cup don't need, yet it is the very existence of such matches that allows cricket to think of itself as a global game. #p#Much has been said on the issue of the Associates in the run-up to this tournament. Probably the most thoughtful and reasoned assessment of their plight came from Ricky Ponting, who in his sporting old age, appears to have found a wisened balance. #p#The World Cup needs to be more competitive, he said, and that can't be argued with. The first two days have seen individual and collective quality, but no competitiveness. But Associates also need to be given a platform to develop. They only get to play big teams once every four years. There, they get duly battered, go away, come back four years later and go through it again. Here is the real plight. #p#Occasionally there is hope: Kenya's run in 2003, Ireland's performances in 2007. But where do they go from there? Into the glass ceiling Ireland spoke of a few years ago? Mostly, there is what happened to Kenya and Canada on Sunday. What, Ponting asked, do they learn from such batterings? #p#Canada showed some spirit and bite in Hambantota. For 25 overs in the field they can say they had things under control. But it was always a precarious kind of hold, prisoner to the gulf in quality of superior opponents and their own lack of exposure to it. Once Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara decided to take the game away, they simply went on and did so. As Canada's Sri Lankan coach Pubudu Dassanayake later acknowledged, they knew what to do; the plans were in place; presumably some kind of SWOT analysis coaches love doing was carried out as well. They just didn't have the tools to do it. #p#In four World Cups since 1979, Canada has won one game, against Bangladesh. Yet there is something to build on with this side. There are young players coming through. They have coaches with international experience. The ICC facilitates their preparation for such tournaments. #p#But without playing any top-flight cricket outside the World Cup, how do they grow as players, as a team, how do they build? Not by playing top sides every four years. #p#Dassanayake seems a cheery man, so he insisted that his players would have learnt something from <m1>the 210-run defeat to Sri Lanka</m1>. "Mainly this is a great experience for my youngsters," he said. "Playing against great bowlers like [Muttiah] Muralitharan and [Ajantha] Mendis, it gives them a lot of confidence. If you talk about talent they are all talented but just not exposed at this level. We can coach certain things but it's all about them going and experiencing this and getting the belief they can compete against top players." #p#They might very well take something from this, but where do they take it? These sides want to become full Test members. Ultimately, that must be the aim of everyone involved in cricket. By not playing regular top-level cricket, or not, as may be the case, playing in future World Cups, that will not happen. #p#Ponting's suggestion - taken up by Mahela Jayawardene as well - that there should be another way of getting them to play constant top-flight cricket offers a solution if there is seriousness about finding one. #p#"You need to give them opportunities to play more regular cricket with top nations," Jayawardene said. "Maybe on and off they need to organise certain things for them because their cricket can be improved. Cricket is a global game and we need to try and make sure everyone plays and comes to that standard one day." #p#Until - and if - that day comes, associates, as Dassanayake put it, are in the dark about where they go next. He is not alone.
4	502147	Australia v Zimbabwe, Group A, World Cup 2011, Ahmedabad	Confident Australia seek winning start	The Preview by Liam Brickhill	February 20, 2011	#p#Match Facts #p#February 21, Ahmedabad Start time 14:30 local time (09:00 GMT) #p#Ricky Ponting has been in good form since his return from injury and will lead a team confident of victory in their opening match Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: Elton Chigumbura | Shaun Tait Matches: Australia v Zimbabwe at Ahmedabad Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Australia | Zimbabwe #p#Big Picture #p#Australia enter uncharted territory as they open their tenth World Cup campaign at Motera in Ahmedabad. For the first time in a cricketing generation, they come into the competition without the favourites tag to weigh them down, and while the expectations of their fans will still be high, a fourth consecutive world title seems a long way off. The Zimbabweans, too, stand at the brink of a new era. A group roundly written off for half a decade - and rightly so - is now a rapidly maturing unit, fully aware of its strengths and how to play to them. #p#While they are clearly no longer the world-beaters of old, Australia remain one of the best limited-overs outfits in world cricket. They left the Ashes in England's hands but tempered that disappointment with a 6-1 trouncing in the one-day series that followed and have an enviable record of 23 consecutive wins in World Cup matches since their semi-final tie against South Africa in 1999. They were well short of their best in their two warm-ups against India and South Africa, but Zimbabwe will be softer targets and haven't beaten Australia in a full one-day international since their famous win at Trent Bridge in 1983. #p#All the same, the Zimbabwe side Australia will meet in Ahmedabad has a different complexion to the one that was thrashed 3-0 in their last bilateral series way back in May 2004. A lot of the names on the Zimbabwe team sheet are the same, but the attitude in the team camp is completely different, and they will also be buoyed by the fact that their most recent confrontations against Australia have both resulted in wins. They triumphed on a rainy night at Newlands in the World Twenty20 in 2007 and then edged a closely-fought encounter in the warm-ups to the 2010 competition in the Caribbean. #p#Those results will have pricked more than just Aussie pride, and where once they would have floated into this match surrounded by an impenetrable aura, now they will be respected but not feared. Ricky Ponting's men have ample firepower to blow Zimbabwe away with both bat and ball, but if they're not at their best the Zimbabweans have a couple of emerging stars of their own who could at least ensure a competitive match. Zimbabwe are one of the better 'minnow' sides at this tournament, and with the ICC seemingly set on expelling Associate nations from the World Cup altogether in the future, a spirited performance from them would at least show that the smaller teams are also capable of playing entertaining cricket. #p#Form guide (Most recent first) #p#Australia: WWWLW Zimbabwe: LLLWL #p#Pitch and conditions #p#While the pitch has a slightly grassy look to it, plenty of that is made up of grass shavings that have been rolled into it so it is not as green as it appears. Recent history suggests that conditions could favour the batsmen - South Africa racked up 365 for 2 here a year ago, with centuries for Jacques Kallis and AB de Villiers. A steaming hot day should be followed by a cool, clear night, and while dew shouldn't be a major factor, it could play some part in the second innings. #p#Watch out for  #p#Zimbabwe's batsmen will be unaccustomed to facing a bowler of Shaun Tait's searing pace, and if he gets past the top order the soft underbelly of the middle order could easily be opened up. In England last year, he hit 160kph and if he even gets near that he'll be too much for the Zimbabweans. A menacing presence with both the new and old ball, he's been in the wickets recently too, taking 3 for 48 against England at the WACA to cap Australia's resounding series win. #p#After a quiet couple of months, Elton Chigumbura seems to be getting back to his effervescent best - with the bat at least - and he cracked a 81-ball 103 against Ireland during Zimbabwe's warm-ups. There's also something about competing against Australia that seems to bring out the best in him: as an 18-year-old in his sixth ODI against an attack containing Glenn McGrath and Shane Watson, he top-scored with 77, and at the World Twenty20 warm-ups in 2010 he cracked 76 from just 35 balls against them to set up a one-run win. #p#Team news #p#Australia have remained tight-lipped on a possible playing XI, but they'll be looking to stamp their authority early on this World Cup and will be loathe to experiment despite the relative weakness of the opposition. That means Callum Ferguson, Tim Paine and perhaps Doug Bollinger will sit out, while Jason Krezja's position will depend on their reading of the pitch. John Hastings is more likely to find his way into the starting line-up. #p#Australia (probable): 1 Shane Watson, 2 Brad Haddin (wk), 3 Ricky Ponting (capt), 4 Michael Clarke, 5 David Hussey, 6 Cameron White, 7 Steve Smith, 8 Mitchell Johnson, 9 John Hastings, 10 Brett Lee, 11 Shaun Tait. #p#The main questions for the Zimbabweans revolve around their top order. Charles Coventry was tried as an opening partner for Brendan Taylor during their warm-ups, with limited success, but it's unlikely he'll make way for the only other specialist opening batsman in the squad - Terry Duffin. The bowling line-up is sure to have an emphasis on spin, while the greater dynamism of Sean Williams' batting means he'll probably sneak in ahead of offspinning allrounder Greg Lamb. #p#Zimbabwe (probable): 1 Brendan Taylor, 2 Charles Coventry, 3 Regis Chakabva, 4 Tatenda Taibu (wk), 5 Craig Ervine, 6 Sean Williams, 7 Elton Chigumbura (capt), 8 Prosper Utseya, 9 Graeme Cremer, 10 Ray Price, 11 Chris Mpofu. #p#Try picking the XIs for tomorrow's game by playing Team Selector. #p#Stats and trivia #p#The highest total at Motera came in the previous match played there, Jacques Kallis and AB de Villiers putting on an unbeaten 173 for the third wicket as South Africa reached 365 for 2. There have been five other totals over 300 at the ground, all of which have come since 2000. #p#A couple of the Zimbabweans won't have happy memories of their last trip to this ground. At the Champions Trophy in 2006, they came up against West Indies here and were bowled out for 85, losing by nine wickets. #p#In 27 ODIs against Zimbabwe, Australia have lost just once - and that was in the first official match between the two sides. #p#Taylor has been in terrific form in the last 18 months, and he'll also draw confidence from his past record against Australia: he made consecutive half-centuries as an 18-year-old in his first two games against an Australian attack including the likes of McGrath, Jason Gillespie and Michael Kasprowicz. #p#Ponting will be making a record 40th World Cup appearance, moving ahead of McGrath (39) and pulling away from Sanath Jayasuriya and Wasim Akram (both 38). #p#Quotes #p#"The pitch is a massive part of the equation. But if you have a bowler like Tait bowling around 160 kmh at the batsmen's toes, it doesn't matter where you are playing. It is still going to hit the batsmen on the full." Brett Lee believes sheer pace alone could be enough to get past the batsmen in Ahmedabad #p#"If we play confidently, play our best cricket and Australia don't, then we may have a chance. Let's be honest, if both sides play their best cricket, it's very likely that we'll lose." Zimbabwe coach Alan Butcher is realistic about his team's chances of causing an upset in their opening game
4	502148	Australia v Zimbabwe, Group A, World Cup 2011, Ahmedabad	Ponting urges Haddin to score big	Brydon Coverdale in Ahmedabad	February 20, 2011	Ricky Ponting said that his injured finger won't be an issue when he plays against Zimbabwe AFP Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: Brad Haddin | Ricky Ponting Matches: Australia v Zimbabwe at Ahmedabad Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Australia #p#Ricky Ponting has called on Brad Haddin to stop wasting his positive starts at the top of the order, as Australia search for the big scores they will need to defend their World Cup title. Haddin is one of the most experienced members of the side but he has been overshadowed by his opening partner Shane Watson in recent months, and hasn't made a hundred in nearly a year. #p#The Australians are in no doubt that Watson can go on and make big scores when it counts - centuries in the semi-final and final at the Champions Trophy two years ago are the proof of that - but they need Haddin to lift his output. During the home summer against Sri Lanka and England, he reached 20 on eight out of ten occasions, but his best effort was 54. #p#It was a frustrating trend for a man who has now had two years to prove himself as an ODI opener. In 35 matches at the top of the order he has made two centuries and averaged 33.58, and while his ability is not in doubt, Ponting would like Haddin, who is one of the leaders within the group and has at times been vice-captain, to show more application once he builds a platform. #p#"It's something we discussed throughout the summer with him as well," Ponting said. "We all understand, as top-order players, you have to make big scores. A 30 or 50 in any form of the game very rarely wins you anything. It's your responsibility as a top-order player to be in late in the innings. #p#"Hadds, sometimes I think the game can get a bit easy for him. He scores really freely and probably just gets a bit carried away with scoring as easily as he does. He needs to pull the reins back in a little bit, work the ball around in those middle overs. He still scores quickly - he's got that ability to score boundaries that other blokes don't have. He and Watson are really big keys for us. They both know that. I'm sure we'll see them play well." #p#A strong start against Zimbabwe in Ahmedabad on Monday would be a boost for Haddin, who made a duck in his only warm-up innings, but the conditions in the subcontinent don't always make it easy to get away briskly. And Zimbabwe are almost certain to open the bowling with a spinner, which will present a different challenge again for Haddin and Watson, who can both handle the slower men but enjoy the ball coming on to the bat. #p#"When you come in on wickets like these over here, it's hard to go in and hit the ball straight away because the pace of the wickets, and of the bowlers you're going to face, are a bit more foreign than we're accustomed to," Ponting said. "Even at the top of the order, we know Haddin and Watson are going to score pretty quickly, but Pup [Michael Clarke] and I are going to need to take our time to get set and make sure that we build a partnership and keep wickets in hand through those middle overs." #p#Unlike Haddin, Ponting did enjoy some valuable time in the middle during the practice matches against India and South Africa, when he made 57 and 55. He is on his way back from a broken finger that ruled him out of the second half of the Australian summer, and despite suffering some discomfort in the nets on Saturday, he was confident he wouldn't be affected during Monday's match. #p#"I haven't been too restricted in the practice games that I've played," he said. "The fact that I'd had four days without any batting was probably the major reason it stiffened up yesterday. It took probably until half-way through my training session yesterday that it started to feel right again. I've been fielding with it taped up because I just prefer a little bit of extra protection." #p#Both men returned to the nets on Sunday, keen to get their eye in before taking on Zimbabwe, but the real test will be when they face the stronger teams further down track. And if the top three of Haddin, Watson and Ponting fire against those sides, Australia will be well on the way to defending their title.
4	502158	Australia v Zimbabwe, Group A, World Cup 2011, Ahmedabad	Zimbabwe pin hopes on spin	Brydon Coverdale in Ahmedabad	February 20, 2011	#p#Zimbabwe's coach, Alan Butcher, thinks it's unlikely his team will beat the defending champions on Monday. The captain of Australia, Ricky Ponting, is not expecting a surprise loss. The bookmakers have Australia as almost unbackable favourites. But somewhere in the back of the minds of this Zimbabwe group is a sliver of hope, the knowledge that upsets can happen. #p#And that if their three spinners can make use of an Ahmedabad pitch that could provide assistance, it might be just enough to bring Australia back down to a more even footing. Of course, everything must go right for Zimbabwe, who have not beaten Australia in an ODI since their shock win at the 1983 World Cup. Everything would also need to go wrong for Australia, who have not lost a World Cup match since 1999, back in the era of Steve Waugh and Alistair Campbell. #p#"The longer a winning run goes, the closer it must be to coming to an end," Butcher said on Sunday. "It may not be us that ends it but someone has got to. All we've done is tried to prepare as well as we can, on the basis that if we play as well as we can in six matches during this World Cup, we can't do any more than that. If on the way one or two of the big sides have a bad day and slip up, hopefully we will take advantage of that. #p#"If we play confidently, play our best cricket and Australia don't, then we may have a chance. Let's be honest, if both sides play their best cricket, it's very likely that we'll lose." #p#Butcher is nothing if not a realist. But the Zimbabweans have kept an eye on Australia's performance during the warm-up matches, when they struggled against top-quality spin. Ray Price, Prosper Utseya and Graeme Cremer are not quite the same as Harbhajan Singh, but spin is the strength of Zimbabwe and Australia will need to force the pace for much of their innings. #p#It's nearly seven years since the teams have met in a one-day international, although the Australians will remember with frustration being upset by Zimbabwe at the 2007 World Twenty20. In the past year, Zimbabwe have had ODI wins against India, Sri Lanka, West Indies and Bangladesh, so they know how to beat good teams, but Ponting is confident his side will have their measure. #p#"We had a good team meeting last night and talked about all their players, individually, and went through batters and bowlers," Ponting said. "They've got a lot of spin options, even a couple of part-time spinners and a quality left-arm offspinner and a legspinner as well, that I wouldn't be surprised if they play. #p#"We've had a good look at them. We know what their strengths and weaknesses are. We've also seen their record, and their record is not that strong either, and that's against some of the smaller nations. We'd expect to play well tomorrow and hopefully get the tournament off on the right note." #p#And after powerful performances from India, New Zealand and Sri Lanka against weaker sides in the opening matches of the tournament, it seems likely Australia will continue the trend. Zimbabwe's most ardent fans might say that it means a surprise is due.
4	502228	Australia v Zimbabwe, Group A, World Cup 2011, Ahmedabad	Zimbabwe look for a bit of magic	Firdose Moonda	February 20, 2011	Ray Price's experience will be crucial to Zimbabwe's World Cup hopes Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: Graeme Cremer | Ray Price | Prosper Utseya Matches: Australia v Zimbabwe at Ahmedabad Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Zimbabwe #p#The ugly stepsisters, the dysfunctional board and the defiant rebels have changed their self destructive ways. The pumpkin that had become Zimbabwe cricket slowly started transforming into a carriage and the Cinderella story of an unlikely revival hopes to reach its happy ending at this World Cup. #p#That doesn't mean taking home a cup, reaching the semi-finals or even being present in the knockout stage at all. It's just means giving a respectable enough account of themselves to prove that the improvement in their cricket is not merely a fairytale, but something tangible. "To justify what's been happening, we need to do things on the field," Prosper Utseya, the Zimbabwe offspinner said. #p#Utseya is referring to the newfound professionalism in Zimbabwe cricket, not just in their franchises system, but in their attitude. The system was established in August 2009, and now that it has had a full calendar year in operation, its fruits may be ready to flower. "We've learnt to be more competitive because the different franchises have all got overseas based cricketers to play in our tournaments as well," Utseya said. #p#Zimbabwe's first global competition after their revamp was the World T20 in the Caribbean in May last year. It turned out to be a massive disappointment for a team of hopefuls, who had spent ample time preparing and where conditions should have suited them, and they lost both their group matches to return home empty handed and without much pride. That they've brought a similar squad to the subcontinent for this World Cup is indicative of them not panicking and applying the first basic principle of engineering: buildings stand on foundations, not air. #p#"We want to be more consistent," Ray Price, Zimbabwe's senior left-arm spinner said. The granddaddy of the team, at 34 years old, has seen it all from the glory days to the gutter and this time he says that is convinced things are different. For him, they certainly are, having left Zimbabwe in 2003 for the county circuit as an ordinary bowler clutching to the fringes of the ODI team and coming back in late 2007 to soar to a career highest second on the ODI bowling rankings. #p#Like Zimbabwe cricket itself, Price underwent a mini-internal revolution just before his comeback. He decided on two things, one that he wanted make cricket his career for as long as he could and that he wanted to do that in Zimbabwe. "I had a terrible job before I was a cricketer," he said, referring to his qualification as an air conditioner repairman. "I just love cricket and I also love Zimbabwe. England was so restrictive. I missed the open space and the people. I'm an outdoors sort of person and Zimbabwe is a lot more peaceful, so I came back." #p#Now, he and Utseya form the pressure cooker of the Zimbabwean bowling attack. They are seen as the containers, the guys who "don't concede a lot of runs and wait for the batsmen to make a mistake." It helps that the two men who have to assume the most mature positions in the team are two of the most senior and understand their roles inside out. They also understand what is still lacking in the Zimbabwean set up and, although they can't do much about it themselves, are trying to ensure that everyone in the squad is aware of it and looking to rectify it. #p#The biggest concern at the moment is the absence of an out and out quick bowler and Utseya says that Zimbabwe have to learn to work within their limitations. "We've never had very quick bowlers, we usually to around 130kph or 135kph but you don't have to be quick to have control. It would be great for our seam bowlers to get a few early breakthroughs for us in this tournament." Price agreed, saying that the team "can't hide behind the spinners forever." #p#For this World Cup, they will be forgiven for being over reliant on the spinners, especially because conditions should suit the structure of their attack. Zimbabwe, who have a strategy of opening with a spinner, have a well rounded and developed spin unit which Utseya says is a result of their conditions in their home country and the circumstances in which they learn the game. "Having a lot of spinners has got to do with the wickets that we've got. It's also our body make up. We are not as naturally big as the South Africans for example. It could be something to do with the food we eat." #p#Whatever the cause of the breed of young tweakers that Zimbabwe are producing, it's working and it's the one element of their game that has helped them restore self belief that they could be a side able to compete with the big boys again. With team confidence has come public interest and legspinner Graeme Cremer said he noticed a marked difference in the attitude to cricket before the national squad left for their first set of warm-ups in Dubai. "People were genuinely interested in us and wishing us god luck for the tournament," he said. "The atmosphere around cricket has changed and the public is starting to care again." #p#For fans that have forgotten what it's like to see their team in Test kit, limited-overs is the ultimate source of competition for now. That's why a good showing at this World Cup will turn the players into Prince Charmings and the sport into magic once again.

Players/Officials: Michael Clarke | Mitchell Johnson | Chris Mpofu | Shane Watson. Matches: Australia v Zimbabwe at Ahmedabad. Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup. Teams: Australia | Zimbabwe #p#<m10>Australia began their World Cup campaign on a winning note, wrapping up an easy 91-run win over a Zimbabwean outfit</m10> that had no answer to the pace battery of Brett Lee, Shaun Tait and Mitchell Johnson, who finished as the pick of the bowlers with 4 for 19. Zimbabwe had put in a spirited display in the field <m11>to keep Australia to 262 for 6</m11> on a good batting wicket, but they never looked like chasing the runs down once a positive opening <m12>stand between Charles Coventry and Brendan Taylor had been broken</m12>. #p#With Lee and Tait steaming in with the new ball, Zimbabwe's openers had every reason to be nervous but they quickly shed their early jitters - Coventry's flambuoyant flash over cover point being a particular highlight - and started to settle before Lee switched his length with immediate reward. <m13>Digging the ball in, he drew a false stroke from Coventry and an ungainly hook resulted in a top edge that Lee himself charged round to catch</m13>. #p#Brendan Taylor did his best to overcome the setback but the revival was short-lived and after <m14>Tatenda Taibu glided Johnson straight to slip</m14> <m15>Tait beat Taylor for pace, aiming one full and straight and pin-balling it off bat and pad to disturb his stumps</m15>. <m16>It was extreme speed that did for Craig Ervine, too, as he took his eyes off a Johnson bumper to wear one on the grille and was pinned on the pad in front of middle and leg by the very next ball</m16>. With the Umpire unwilling to send him on his way, a successful referral was asked for and Zimbabwe's chase quickly began to slide towards the mire at <m17>44 for 4 in the 13th over</m17>. #p#Williams didn't look particularly comfortable against Johnson either, but <m18>he and Chigumbura did at least manage to survive the onslaught and slowly began to rebuild against Australia's second string</m18>. The chase derailed completely when <m19>Chigumbura gloved Jason Krejza to Haddin for 14 in the 22nd over</m19> and Zimbabwe's last hopes evaporated soon after, <m20>Williams wafting Tait to slip as the score sank to 96 for 6</m20>. Despite some stubborn resistance from Prosper Utseya and Graeme Cremer, there was no coming back from there. #p#Smart Stats. <m21>Australia scored just 28 runs in the first ten overs of their innings</m21>. Their lowest ever aggregate in the first ten overs since 2000 is 7 for 4 against South Africa in Cape Town in 2006. <m22>Shane Watson, during the course of his 79</m22>, scored his 20th half-century in ODIs. In 28 matches since the beginning of 2010, he has scored one century and ten fifties at an average of 42.81. <m23>Ricky Ponting was run out</m23> for the 30th time in ODIs, which is second only to Mark Waugh's 32 run-out dismissals among Australian batsmen. Ponting also holds the record for most run-out dismissals in Tests (14). <m24>Ray Price, who picked up 1 for 43 off his ten overs</m24>, has a career economy rate of 3.87, which is the best among spinners who have bowled in at least 50 innings. With their <m25>91-run victory</m25>, Australia extended their undefeated streak in World Cups to 30 matches. Their last defeat in World Cups came against Pakistan in May 1999. <m26>Mitchell Johnson finished with figures of 4 for 19 in 9.2 overs at an economy rate of 2.03</m26>. Among Australian bowlers who have bowled at least eight overs in an innings in a World Cup match, Shane Warne has the best economy rate of 1.10 against West Indies in 1999. Ricky Ponting has now played in the most World Cup matches (40), going past Glenn Mcgrath, with whom he shared the previous record of 39 matches. #p#It had been a different story for Zimbabwe when they were in the field as some disciplined bowling and inspired fielding ensured Australia's batsmen never really got away from them. As has been the case so often in recent times, <m27>Shane Watson provided the bulk of the runs at the top of the order with a well-paced 79</m27>, while <m28>Michael Clarke guided their charge past 250 with an unbeaten 58</m28>. #p#<m29>Watson and Haddin made a strangely subdued start</m29>, and despite the admirable professionalism shown by Zimbabwe's attack one might have expected more than 28 runs to have come from the first Powerplay. While Chris Mpofu, the only specialist seamer in the side, maintained a disciplined off-stump line, Ray Price shared the new pill and also lived up to his unapologetically brusque reputation, laying into Watson before he'd even faced a ball. #p#The batsmen finally decided they had had enough of the wait-and-see tactic and broke loose with <m30>17 off Mpofu's sixth over</m30> but <m31>Zimbabwe struck back when Utseya came on at the end of the first Powerplay</m31>. After an exemplary start to his spell - in which not a run was scored for the first nine deliveries he sent down - <m32> he had his reward when Haddin stepped back to a flighted delivery and was struck in line with middle and leg. Umpire Asoka de Silva thought there might have been an inside edge, but Zimbabwe asked for a review - this being their first ever look at the UDRS - and had the decision over-turned.</m32> #p#After a quiet start to his innings Watson started to strike the ball with ominous force, <m33>lifting Cremer into the stands with a brutal pull</m33>, before <m34>he was removed by Zimbabwe's second fortuitous referral of the day. Stretching forward to a Cremer legbreak, Watson played with more pad than bat to prompt an emotive appeal. This time it was Umpire Richard Kettleborough who decided there was enough doubt to turn it down, but wicketkeeper Tatenda Taibu insisted on a referral and Zimbabwe were rewarded with the result they wanted.</m34> #p#They were given a serious lift in the very next over as <m35>Ricky Ponting, in his first full international innings since his return from a finger injury, took on Mpofu's arm with a hard-run second as the ball rolled to midwicket. A pinpoint rocket throw hit the wicket directly to catch him well short to spark wild celebrations from Zimbabwe and with that Australia were 144 for 3</m35>. <m36>Clarke and Cameron White started their rebuilding effort cautiously</m36> and Zimbabwe never let the game get away from them, <m37>Mpofu recovering well from a cumbersome start to his spell at the death to rattle White's stumps and reduce Australia to 207 for 4</m37>. #p#<m38>David Hussey and Steve Smith came and went in quick succession</m38> but gave the innings some oomph while they were at the crease, both clearing the boundary with some powerful strokes. Clarke remained to guide Australia to a total which, while probably not as many as they would have hoped for, still proved far too much for a Zimbabwe line-up with precious little experience of facing express international fast bowling. #p#Match Timeline
4	502380	Australia v Zimbabwe, World Cup 2011, Ahmedabad	Confusion with team sheets and some stubborn bails	Brydon Coverdale at Motera	February 21, 2011	Brad Haddin breathed a sigh of relief as the bails stayed on. AFP Enlarge Related Links. Matches: Australia v Zimbabwe at Ahmedabad. Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup. Teams: Australia | Zimbabwe #p#Confusion of the day. The television coverage created some drama before a ball had been bowled, with the commentators discussing Australia's decision to leave Shaun Tait out of the team. There was only one problem: Tait was playing. It even sparked confusion in the Australian dressing-room, as the official team sheet was checked to ensure there wasn't a mistake. They breathed a sigh of relief when they saw Tait's name listed, and after several minutes of uncertainty the TV coverage rectified its team lists. The Zimbabwe side was also wrong - Greg Lamb's name was on the screen in the starting XI, but he was ill and was not part of the team. #p#Quick learners of the day. Zimbabwe had never before played in a match where the UDRS was being used, and the fourth official Simon Taufel spoke to the players in the lead-up to the game, to explain the finer details of how it works. There were reportedly some baffled looks around the playing group, and the only questions asked came from the always outgoing Ray Price. But when it came to the crunch, their captain Elton Chigumbura employed the system perfectly in the field, <m1>winning two overturned decisions from two attempts</m1>. <m2>An lbw appeal against Brad Haddin was denied by Asoka de Silva, but the replays showed Prosper Utseya's delivery would have hit the stumps</m2>, and later <m3>Graeme Cremer won an lbw wicket after Richard Kettleborough turned down a shout against Shane Watson</m3>. #p#Ricochet of the day. <m4>Haddin had already had a life. He could so easily have been back in the pavilion on 16 when he got an inside edge onto his leg and the ball bounced back to hit the stumps. However, despite clipping the wood with reasonable force, the ball couldn't dislodge a bail.</m4> Tatenda Taibu leapt in frustration behind the stumps, and Haddin could do little but raise his eyebrows in relief. <m5>He only added another 13 runs from a further 23 deliveries</m5>, though, and his habit of making starts without going on to post big scores will continue to be a source of bother for the Australians. #p#Throw of the day. The Zimbabweans aren't exactly renowned for their magnificent fielding, so it was understandable that Ricky Ponting and Michael Clarke hustled back for two runs when Clarke clipped the ball to deep midwicket. But in one of those memorable moments of individual brilliance, <m6>Chris Mpofu fired the ball flat and fast towards the bowler's end, hitting the stumps from side-on and from three quarters of the way to the boundary. It caught Ponting just short</m6> and the throw had to be perfect - had it not been a direct hit, the bowler Sean Williams would hardly have had time to whip off the bails with Ponting out of his ground. #p#Regret of the day. While Australia's middle order was struggling to lift its tempo against Zimbabwe's spinners, reports were emerging from Perth that Michael Hussey had trained so well on Sunday that Western Australia wanted to play him in the Sheffield Shield match that began on Monday. Hussey was originally a key man in Australia's World Cup plans but was replaced due to a hamstring injury that they feared would not be fixed in time for Australia's opening games. There were also reports that selector Greg Chappell had told the 35-year-old Hussey he should retire, although Chappell has strongly denied the claim. Either way, Australia would have loved to have Hussey to tackle Zimbabwe's slow bowlers. As it turned out, he decided against playing the Shield match, choosing instead to stick to the recovery schedule originally set down for him by Cricket Australia. #p#Shot of the day. If Australia thought their all-out pace was going to frighten Zimbabwe's openers, they would have been surprised by Charles Coventry's early approach. <m7>It took only until the fourth over for Coventry to launch a flat smash over point off Lee, and he struck it so well that it easily cleared the boundary. The ball wasn't short, but Coventry lifted it with a square drive</m7> that could just about have killed if it connected with a member of the crowd. Sadly for Zimbabwe's fans, there wasn't much more in the armoury.
4	502407	Australia v Zimbabwe, Group A, World Cup 2011, Ahmedabad	Australia's batsmen off the pace	Brydon Coverdale at Motera	February 21, 2011	#p#It was no great surprise that the speed of Shaun Tait, Mitchell Johnson and Brett Lee was too much for Zimbabwe to handle. If only, the Australians must be thinking, we could face the same sort of pace ourselves. A <m1>91-run win</m1> was a fine result for Ricky Ponting's men, a solid way to start their campaign for a fourth consecutive World Cup title, but deep down they know they should have made more runs. #p#Their problem, as it was in the warm-up matches, was that they struggled to get used to the conditions and score freely against spin. It's an issue they need to address, because much stronger opponents than Zimbabwe await them over the next few weeks, and <m2>not every team will quiver at the sight of the fast men as Zimbabwe's top order did when they fell to 44 for 4</m2>. #p#<m3>Ray Price, Prosper Utseya, Graeme Cremer, Brendan Taylor and Sean Williams sent down 39 overs for Zimbabwe</m3>, and by the end the captain Elton Chigumbura was probably wishing slow men had bowled all 50. <m4>The pace bowlers, Chris Mpofu and Chigumbura himself, combined for 11 overs that cost 76 runs</m4>. #p#It's a lesson that would have been taken in by Australia's upcoming opponents. Ponting spoke before the match of how it is difficult for batsmen to get settled on the slower pitches on the subcontinent, and so it proved once again. <m5>Michael Clarke was the only one of the top five who scored at better than a run a ball</m5>, pacing his innings well as he has in his past few games. #p#"We need to play better, there's no doubt about that," Ponting said after the win. "We need to have our own games and our own game-plans sorted out for the better spinning attacks. As the tournament goes on, we're going to need to be on top of our games and we're probably not quite there just yet, but the more we play and the more we become accustomed to these conditions, the better we'll get." #p#Of course, not every team will use five slow bowlers, as Zimbabwe did. But then, many pitches will provide the spinners with more assistance - Price and company didn't extract big turn, but rather tied the Australians down with skiddy straighter balls and changes in length. Australia's next opponents are New Zealand, who have Daniel Vettori and they might follow Zimbabwe's lead and open with a spinner, as Nathan McCullum did against Kenya. #p#If that happens, it's all the more important that Brad Haddin and Shane Watson go after the seamers with the new ball, which they didn't do against Zimbabwe. <m6>There was one big over, when Haddin showed how he likes the ball coming on to the bat, driving Mpofu over wide mid-off while Watson pulled viciously</m6>, but <m7>after 13 overs, Australia were 32 for 0</m7>. Again, Haddin got a start and failed to go on with it, a trend that Ponting wants him to turn around. It won't be easy if spinners keep bowling up front. #p#"That's something that me and Brad are going to have to continue to get our heads around but also, when a spinner comes on, knowing that we don't have to take a lot of risks," said Watson, who was the Man of the Match for his 79. "With there only being two guys out on the boundary, just playing good shots [is enough] and hopefully we can get off to a much better start next time and take a bit of pressure off the middle order." #p#Within that middle order Cameron White's scratchiness is becoming a bit of a concern. At No. 5, he is supposed to be the man who lifts the tempo after a platform has been set, but he needed a lesson from Ahmedabad's rickshaw drivers on how to pierce a gap. Not since Australia's tour of India back in October has White constructed a really strong one-day innings, and although Ponting has given him some advice, he does not believe White's form is an issue. #p#"I had a good chat to Cam yesterday at training, about his batting and about what I feel he needs to do and what he needs to work on over here," Ponting said. "The position that he's batting in the order in these conditions is vastly different than what it is in Australia. When you go in in Australia on the good, hard, bouncy wickets it's a bit easier to get off strike and rotate strike. It's a lot harder to do it here when there's good quality spinners bowling and the field generally comes in when you have the loss of a couple of quick wickets. I'm not worried about him at all." #p#As White and Clarke chipped the ball around, and the innings ticked past the 40th over, acceleration didn't become any easier. <m8>There were a couple of big hits from David Hussey and Steven Smith in the final couple of overs</m8>, but 262 was not quite what Australia had in mind when they chose to bat. #p#In the end, it mattered little, as Johnson, Lee and Tait passed their first test of the tournament, their wicket tally more prominent than their runs conceded. But the challenges, for both batsmen and bowlers, will only become greater as this World Cup wears on.
4	502408	Australia v Zimbabwe, World Cup 2011, Ahmedabad	Butcher admits to problems against pace	Brydon Coverdale at Motera	February 21, 2011	#p#For half the match, it almost looked like Zimbabwe would challenge Australia. Their spinners bowled well, their fielding was excellent and <m1>they kept the world champions to a gettable 262</m1>. Could it be that Zimbabwe, not a minnow but by no means a piranha, would end the 23-match World Cup winning streak of the biggest fish in the cricketing pond? Well, no, because Shaun Tait, Mitchell Johnson and Brett Lee were still to play their part. #p#But what Zimbabwe showed was that they can compete with the strongest sides, and toppling a higher-ranked team or two is not out of the question over the next few weeks. On the sluggish pitches they will encounter, the spin of Ray Price, Prosper Utseya and Graeme Cremer will be key, but to really threaten, they must find runs from their top order. #p#Brendan Taylor, Charles Coventry and Tatenda Taibu have the talent to give their side good starts, but the speed of Australia's bowlers was simply too much. <m2>Coventry slapped Lee over point for six</m2> but was jumpy in playing the shorter balls, <m3>and was caught when he top-edged an attempted pull</m3>, and <m4>Taylor was beaten by the sheer pace of an accurate Tait delivery</m4>. #p#"I was really pleased with the way we bowled and fielded," Zimbabwe's coach Alan Butcher said after the <m5>91-run loss</m5>. "We had a disaster against Ireland in the field [in the warm-up game] and we've worked very hard to put that right, because that's one of our strengths and we have to be good at that. I would say that I'm qualified in my praise for the team because, yes, most of it was okay, but we obviously need to bat better. #p#"We didn't really play [the fast bowlers] as well as we might have done. We don't see too much of that sort of pace in Zimbabwe, so it's something we're going to have to get used to if we're going to compete at the top level of international cricket." #p#Zimbabwe's next game is far from a top-of-the-table clash, against Canada in Nagpur next Monday, and they will fancy their chances of securing their opening win of the tournament. Led by Price, who is a tricky customer with the new ball, their spinners kept Australia on the leash at Motera, and they were backed up in the field, highlighted by a frighteningly accurate throw from Chris Mpofu in the deep that caught Ricky Ponting short. #p#"It's a big positive for the team, I thought our bowling and fielding was superb today," Zimbabwe captain Elton Chigumbura said. "It's something that we have to carry on in the rest of the tournament. Now we just have to work on our batting. We just have to make sure that we keep wickets in hand in the early period. <m6>After ten overs, that's when we lost two or three quick wickets</m6>. From there, playing a bigger team it's always hard to come back." #p#But to their credit, <m7>Zimbabwe didn't fold after crashing to 44 for 4</m7>, and <m8>some lower-order runs helped them climb to 171</m8>. It was another positive in a match that should give Zimbabwean fans hope of a heartening World Cup campaign.
4	502461	ICC World Cup	Ponting confident pacemen can dominate	Brydon Coverdale	February 22, 2011	Australia's pacemen had the Zimbabwe batsmen hopping in their game on Monday. Associated Press Enlarge Related Links. Players/Officials: Mitchell Johnson | Brett Lee | Ricky Ponting | Shaun Tait. Matches: Australia v Zimbabwe at Ahmedabad. Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup. Teams: Australia #p#Ricky Ponting is confident Australia's pace attack can threaten every team in the World Cup, after they proved too good for Zimbabwe in the <m1>91-run win</m1> at Motera on Monday. Australia have gambled on a bowling unit full of speed for this tournament and <m2>Mitchell Johnson took 4 for 19</m2> in the opening victory, while Shaun Tait and Brett Lee also fired. #p#The Zimbabwe top-order batsmen were jumpy against Tait and Lee in particular, but the captain was most pleased by the accuracy of Johnson, who he believes can be one of the stars of the tournament. Although it's difficult to draw from that performance how Australia will fare against the stronger teams, Ponting is confident that no batsman will enjoy facing the trio. #p#"If we get those three up and running and bowling as well as they can, then I don't care what team we're playing against or what conditions we're playing in, that intimidation is going to be there," Ponting said. "Those three guys are pushing 150kph and with the conditions that we've seen, the ball's going to reverse at different times here as well. #p#"If we've got those three guys bowling well in reverse-swinging conditions, then it's going to be difficult. They can intimidate because they can use their short balls well. They generally don't give too much away either. If they're all bowling well, we'll go a long way in the tournament." #p#Ponting described Johnson's effort against Zimbabwe as one of the best spells he had seen from the left-armer in one-day cricket, and <m3>his two wickets in two overs early in the innings helped halt Zimbabwe's fight</m3>. Johnson has taken 32 ODI wickets at 21.25 in India and he is set to overtake Nathan Bracken as Australia's most successful bowler in the country. #p#Ponting believes that Johnson will succeed in the subcontinental conditions again, after an Australian summer in which it seemed like the bad old Mitchell Johnson was back to stay. But having been axed for the Adelaide Ashes Test, Johnson began to regain his form, and even before the Zimbabwe outing, the captain was confident he could be one of the key men in the World Cup. #p#"With the skill set he's got, he could be one of the players of the tournament, there's no doubt about that," Ponting said in the lead-up to the opening match. "We saw in the last couple of games in Australia how dangerous he can be with the bat. He went in as a pinch hitter in Sydney and got 50-odd for us there and changed the way the game was going. #p#"He went to Perth then, and probably bowled as well as he bowled for the whole summer, got 3 for 18 or something and got a few runs as well. He's in pretty good shape at the moment. He's got the chance to be one of the outstanding players in this tournament." #p#Australia left Doug Bollinger and John Hastings out of their series opener, and after the success of the attack it is unlikely there will be any changes for their second match against New Zealand. <m4>Jason Krejza also showed some promising signs against Zimbabwe, collecting 2 for 28</m4>, and should hold his place for Friday's game.

Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Australia #p#Ricky Ponting has escaped with a reprimand from the ICC after the incident that resulted in a damaged television in Australia's dressing room during the win over Zimbabwe in Ahmedabad on Monday. Ponting was not fined and there was no formal hearing, after he accepted a level one charge and the reprimand from the match referee Roshan Mahanama. #p#Ponting was visibly frustrated as he left the field after being run out, and he threw his groin protector at his kit bag, only for it bounce up and hit the corner of the television. The Australian camp stressed that the damage to the TV was accidental and he immediately reported it, but the Gujarat Cricket Association (GCA) still filed a complaint with the BCCI. #p#Ponting was found to have breached clause 2.1.2 of the ICC Code of Conduct, which relates to "abuse of cricket equipment or clothing, ground equipment or fixtures and fittings during an international match" However, while the level one charge could have carried a fine of up to 50% of Ponting's match fee, the ICC accepted that the incident was unintentional. #p#"Ricky knows that his action was in breach of the code, involving a brief moment of frustration," Mahanama said. "That said, it was clear that the damage he caused was purely accidental and without malice, he apologised shortly after the incident at the ground and immediately agreed to pay for the damage." #p#It was the second time in two months that Ponting found himself charged with a level one offence, after he was fined 40% of his match fee for the Boxing Day Test, over a prolonged debate with the umpire Aleem Dar over a decision review that went against the Australians. The latest incident has captured the attention of the local media, with several newspapers reporting on the morning after the game that Ponting had smashed the TV with his bat, which was not the case.
4	502772	ICC World Cup	Ponting accepts 'responsibility' for TV incident	Brydon Coverdale	February 24, 2011	Ricky Ponting has accepted that he did "overstep" the line with his reaction in the dressing room. Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: Ricky Ponting Matches: Australia v Zimbabwe at Ahmedabad Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Australia #p#Ricky Ponting has accepted that he crossed the line with his dressing-room reaction to being run out against Zimbabwe in Ahmedabad on Monday, but is keen to put the incident behind him. Ponting was reprimanded by the ICC for breaking the Code of Conduct when he threw his groin protector at his kit bag and it bounced up to damage a television, and he said he wished he could take his actions back. #p#"I think there's a limit [to how much] you can let off steam in a dressing room," Ponting said. "It is a pretty sacred sort of place, an international cricket team dressing room, but there's a line that you can't overstep and when some equipment is damaged in the change room then I accept the responsibility for that happening the other day, albeit by total accident and with no malice involved in it whatsoever. What's happened has happened. I'd like to be able to take it back but I can't. Now we've just got to move on." #p#The TV incident emerged on the morning after Australia's 91-run victory, but the initial reports in local newspapers incorrectly suggested that an angry Ponting had smashed the set with his bat. Given that Ponting was not even fined for the level one offence, it was not surprising that by Thursday in Nagpur, all he wanted to do was concentrate on the next day's match against New Zealand. #p#"It was hit by my box that I'd thrown down into my cricket kit," he said. "[There was] some small damage to the TV set; I went and reported it to the team manager straight away, and let him know what had happened. They replaced the television set there and then. #p#"Some of the stories I've been hearing the last couple of days have been a little bit different than what the list of events actually were. Hopefully by the end of today we can put this all behind us and start worrying about a big game of cricket that's going to take place tomorrow." #p#The Ahmedabad game was Ponting's 40th World Cup match, making him the most-capped player in the tournament's history. Ponting is yet to lose a World Cup game as captain. If Australia do win against New Zealand in Nagpur it will be Ponting's 24th victory as a World Cup captain.
4	503684	World Cup 2011	Slow-start story 'laughable' - Haddin	ESPNcricinfo staff	March 1, 2011	<m1>Brad Haddin scored 29 off 66 balls against Zimbabwe</m1>. AFP Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: Brad Haddin Matches: Australia v Zimbabwe at Ahmedabad Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Australia #p#Brad Haddin, the Australian opener, has rubbished reports that the ICC's Anti-Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU) were looking into Australia's slow start in their Group A match against Zimbabwe in Ahmedabad. #p#"It's quite a laughable story. It's a joke," Haddin told reporters during a net session at the SSC in Colombo. "We just got off the mark a bit slowly." #p#<m2>Haddin and Shane Watson, the Australian openers, scored five runs in the first two overs</m2> and <m3>only 28 in the first ten</m3>. <m4>Australia eventually went on to score 262 for 6</m4>, after which their bowlers secured <m5>a 91-run victory</m5>. #p#The story, which was reported by Press Trust of India , was also criticised by Australian team manager Steve Bernard, who said that "it was the silliest thing I've heard this week - and I've heard a lot of silly things since I've been here" #p#"I've just heard the story a moment ago and I'm not sure how to respond, except to say it would make a cat laugh. It's the most ludicrous thing I've ever heard in my life that a side can be 0-5 after two overs and that that's suspicious." #p#The ICC said it did not comment on any ACSU matter, including whether or not a match had been investigated. In the last few years however, with the advent of spread betting, the ACSU has been on high alert to keep an eye on unusual scoring patterns. Since the spot-fixing scandal, they have been keeping tabs by monitoring a large number of matches.
5	502349	England v Netherlands, Group B, World Cup 2011, Nagpur	No room for lemons in City of Oranges	Andrew Miller	February 21, 2011	#p#Match Facts #p#February 22, Nagpur Start time 14:30 local time (09:00 GMT) #p#The outfield is awash with orange as Ryan ten Doeschate warms up for the World Cup AFP Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: Tom de Grooth | Kevin Pietersen | Andrew Strauss | Ryan ten Doeschate Matches: England v Netherlands at Nagpur Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup #p#Big Picture #p#Whisper it, but England owe the Netherlands a significant debt of favour. The last time these two teams met was at Lord's in June 2009 on a soggy opening night of the World Twenty20, when Ryan ten Doeschate, Tom de Grooth, Edgar Schiferli and Co. inflicted a sensational humiliation on an England team who were still resettling after their Moores/Pietersen upheaval, and had yet to recognise the need to front up in all formats. #p#It was a notable nadir, and a result that still ranks as one of the most abject moments in England's often chequered history in ICC competitions. And yet, it was arguably the hurry-up that they needed. Since that night, England have gone on to win and retain the Ashes, they triumphed at the subsequent World Twenty20 in the Caribbean, and until last month's ODI debagging in Australia, they had not lost a series in any format of the game since September 2009. #p#Perhaps unsurprisingly, the memories of that evening have been surpressed by both teams in the build-up to this rematch. On the one hand, the Dutch have no wish to relinquish their comforting status as underdogs, but on the other, there is a widespread acceptance that England in 2011 are a very different proposition. They are not among the outright favourites for the World Cup by any stretch of the imagination, but neither should they be the makeweights who have disgraced every edition of the tournament since 1996. #p#Netherlands could hardly wish for a more portentous venue than Nagpur, India's so-called city of Oranges, although in a contest stretched over 100 overs rather than 40, England's experience ought to tell in the end - just as it did against Canada in their inauspicious warm-up in Fatullah last week, and indeed in Peshawar 15 years ago , when the teenaged Bas Zuiderent stole the plaudits for his maiden fifty, if not the result. England were as bad as they've ever been in that campaign. They've come a long way since then. #p#Form guide (Most recent first) #p#England: LLLWL Netherlands: LLWLL #p#Pitch and conditions #p#There has been a distinct English feel to the weather in Nagpur in recent days with cloud cover and drizzle in the air. Similar is forecast for the match which will suit both sides who are more used to cooler conditions. The nets have been a little spicy, but don't expect the surface to offer the same life. #p#Watch out for  #p#The big talking point is Kevin Pietersen's promotion to the top of the England order. It's not a role he has attempted too often in the past, although his 131 from 122 balls against India A in Bangalore seven years ago provides some evidence of what he might be able to achieve. Besides, so far in the tournament, No. 1 has been the place to bat, with Sehwag, Tamim, Dilshan and Watson all cashing in on their opportunities. KP's never better than when he has a point to prove. #p#Ryan ten Doeschate is the Netherlands' outstanding performer. A big-hitting and technically correct batsman, and a tricksy seamer with a good change-up in pace and a range of subtle variations, he has honed his skills as a stalwart at Essex, and is the one Dutch player who would press for a place in the England middle-order. A lot will rest on his shoulders if they are to come close to matching their shock result two years ago. #p#Team news #p#Graeme Swann is back with England's squad after an eventful month which began with a back injury in Australia, and culminated in the birth of his first son, Wilfred, only days after his successful quashing of a drink-driving charge at Nottingham Magistrates' Court. Assuming he has regained his fitness and focus after all that, he'll be straight back into the side, and may be joined by the late squad addition Ravi Bopara, whose powerful strokeplay could be vital in the absence of Eoin Morgan. #p#England (probable) 1 Kevin Pietersen, 2 Andrew Strauss (capt), 3 Jonathan Trott, 4 Ian Bell, 5 Paul Collingwood, 6 Matt Prior (wk), 7 Ravi Bopara, 8 Tim Bresnan, 9 Graeme Swann, 10 Stuart Broad, 11 James Anderson. #p#The Dutch captain Peter Borren is expected to play but will not bowl after suffering an abdominal strain. There could be a new look at the top of the order with the young wicketkeeper, Wesley Barresi, touted as a possible opening partner for the Worcestershire starlet, Alexei Kervezee. "I think [Barresi] can handle this level of cricket: not only handle it, but also do very, very well," said Borren. #p#Netherlands (possible) 1 Alexei Kervezee, 2 Wesley Barresi (wk), 3 Eric Szwarczynski, 4 Tom Cooper, 5 Ryan ten Doeschate, 6 Peter Borren (capt), 7 Bas Zuiderent, 8 Tom de Grooth, 9 Mudassar Bukhari, 10 Adeel Raja, 11 Bradley Kruger. #p#Try picking the XIs for tomorrow's game by playing Team Selector. #p#Stats and trivia #p#The first meeting between these two teams came in Peshawar exactly 15 years ago , when Graeme Hick's century proved the difference between two improbably well-matched teams. Bas Zuiderent was playing in his and his country's second full ODI, and made 54 as an 18-year-old. #p#The second, and most recent, 50-over meeting occurred in East London in the 2003 World Cup, and was a much more one-sided affair. James Anderson, blazing a trail in his maiden international season, claimed 4 for 25 as the Dutch crashed to 142 all out. #p#Paul Collingwood has played two matches in his career against the Dutch   and lost them both. The most recent was of course the Lord's Twenty20, but he first tasted defeat while playing for Durham at Amstelveen in the third round of the NatWest Trophy in 1999. He made 7 from 39 balls in a five-wicket defeat. #p#Quotes #p#"[Losing intensity] was an accusation that could have been levelled during the one-day series in Australia. But not the World Cup. We're up for it. There's a good vibe and buzz about everything out here at the moment." Andrew Strauss promises there will be no post-Ashes hangover in England's performances on the subcontinent #p#"Certainly half the squad were there on that evening and they are fully aware of what is possible on any given day. I know it was a shorter version but they are going to take quite a bit of confidence out of that victory into this." The Dutch coach Peter Drinnen knows his team will remember that winning feeling after their heroics at Lord's two years ago
5	502350	England v Netherlands, Group B, World Cup 2011, Nagpur	Netherlands can boost Associate image	Nagraj Gollapudi in Nagpur	February 21, 2011	So much rests on Ryan ten Doeschate's shoulders for Netherlands Thota Sreenivas Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: Peter Borren | Ryan ten Doeschate Matches: England v Netherlands at Nagpur Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: England | Netherlands #p#It is a difficult time to be an Associate. With plans to curtail the number of teams to ten for the next edition of the World Cup, the ICC has inadvertently put a psychological burden on the shoulders of the four Associates participating in this edition. The heavy defeats suffered by Kenya and Canada on Sunday have only added to the pressure. So is it time for the Netherlands, who begin their campaign tomorrow against England, to step up the plate? #p#Peter Borren, the Netherlands captain, does not necessarily agree that his team need to win to prove the ICC or anybody else wrong. "The decision from the ICC will not have any effect on whether we should step up or not. We have taken a professional approach to our preparations. What might happen in 2015 will not matter going into tomorrow's game." #p#Borren, who has been laid low by an abdominal strain and failed to play in the warm-up matches, had his first complete training on Sunday and declared himself fit play as a batsman but won't bowl. He also had another take on the ICC move, when pushed to take a stand. #p#"It is hard to have an opinion until we need to prove ourselves out there on the field," he said. "Perhaps [then] we can make our own statement with regards to what happens in the future of the 50-over World Cup. The Associates offer a lot in a World Cup. Everyone enjoys the underdog doing well and there have been instances throughout all World Cups. We are hoping by pulling off some results that happened in the past we can then ask that question on the field." #p#One such upset happened when Netherlands shocked England at Lord's in the opening match of the 2009 World Twenty20. That four-wicket win remains fresh in the minds of both contestants with Andrew Strauss sounding out an alert to his players. "If we are 10 percent off and they [Holland] have a good day, we are in trouble," he said. #p#It was the first significant victory for Netherlands, who also got the better of Bangladesh last year in an ODI in Glasgow and Borren felt the team are in the right frame of mind. "We have prepared as well as we can. Obviously that night [against England] gives us little bit of the confidence going into tomorrow's fixture. With the confidence in the team and the preparation we have had in the last two years it would be nice to pull off a victory as we did two years ago." #p#Still it will be not an easy ride. Even if England enter the World Cup after a long Ashes tour and a 6-1 drubbing at the hands in the ODI series, they remain the favourites with numerous matchwinners in their ranks. Netherlands, meanwhile, will look to their key player in Ryan ten Doeschate, the Essex allrounder and Associate Player of the Year. #p#Though Borren said that all 15 squad members could create an impact, the numbers betray that confidence. Netherlands have had only five centurions in their ODI history and three of them are retired - although ten Doeschate has three tons to his name - and no bowler has ever taken a five-wicket haul. #p#The onus will be on ten Doeschate, Tom Cooper from South Australia and Worcestershire's Alexei Kervezee, the only professionals in the squad, to influence Netherland's chances. However, the other man who could play an important role is Bas Zuiderent who is the only Dutchman to play every World Cup match. He appeared in his first World Cup as an 18-year-old in 1996 and hit a fifty against England, 15 years to the day when the teams meet on Tuesday. #p#"If we can create pressure through disciplined bowling in our areas and fielding well I expect to create chances, but it is also about taking them," Borren said. Only a collective effort can ensure that Netherlands can celebrate more nights like the one on June 25, 2009 and force the ICC to not dim the lights on them.

Scorecard #p#<m7>Ryan ten Doeschate produced a breathtaking century to lift Netherlands to a massive total.</m7> Getty Images Enlarge Related Links News :. England save themselves Oranje faces. Analysis : ten Doeschate sets inspiring example. Players/Officials: Ravi Bopara | Paul Collingwood | Andrew Strauss | Ryan ten Doeschate | Jonathan Trott Matches: England v Netherlands at Nagpur Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: England | Netherlands #p#<m8>Ryan ten Doeschate produced a scintillating 119 from 110 balls</m8>, and followed up with <m9>the brilliant bowling figures of 2 for 47 in ten overs</m9>, to give England one of the biggest frights of their international lives. However, his very best efforts were not quite enough to propel the Netherlands to an incredible victory in their World Cup opener at Nagpur. #p#Faced with a massive target of 293, and humiliation on an even greater scale than they suffered at Lord's two years ago, England responded with a determined batting performance under the floodlights, and thanks to composed <m10>half-centuries from Andrew Strauss and Jonathan Trott</m10>, they eventually <m11>reached safety with six wickets and eight balls to spare</m11>. However, the final margin of victory did no justice to the journey they were forced to undertake. Had England stumbled, it would surely have gone down as the greatest upset in World Cup history. #p#The final overs were fraught with possibility, as England battled with a run-rate that barely dipped below seven an over, against a pumped-up team of performers who could mainline their adrenalin straight from that opening fixture of the World Twenty20. <m12>With 69 needed from the final ten overs</m12>, <m13>Trott was exquisitely stumped off a leg-side wide by Wesley Barresi</m13>, <m14>who had earlier launched the Dutch innings with a sparky cameo of 29 from 25 balls</m14>, and when the in-form <m15>Ian Bell was bowled middle stump by the final ball of ten Doeschate's spell</m15>, Nagpur really was living up to its reputation as the City of Orange. #p#That dismissal left England's fate in the hands of Paul Collingwood, who has barely been able to buy an international run all winter, and Ravi Bopara, whose inclusion at the expense of the second spinner Michael Yardy contributed to their problems in the field, but for which <m16>he ultimately atoned with a vital 30 not out from 20 balls</m16>, including <m17>a soothing six over long-off from the first ball off the 49th over</m17> - the first of England's innings. #p#It was Collingwood who proved the key, however. He was England's captain when they lost in 2009, and ten years earlier he had also been on the receiving end of a NatWest Trophy beating while playing for Durham in Amstelveen. The threat of a triple dose of humiliation compelled him to rediscover his fighting spirit, and he restored faith in both himself and his team with <m18>an unbeaten 30 from 23</m18>. #p#It was all extraordinarily fraught. Whereas previous shocks have revolved around batting collapses in helpful conditions - think Ireland in Jamaica four years ago, or West Indies against Kenya in 1996 - this performance was all about the weight of runs that the derided Dutchmen were able to pile onto England's shoulders. With Associate cricket in the spotlight like never before, following the decision to reduce the 2015 World Cup to 10 teams, and in light of the recent capitulations by Canada and Kenya in Group A, this was a performance that showed the sport's second tier in the best and most timely light imaginable. #p#ten Doeschate's prowess in limited-overs cricket is hardly a secret - he averaged 54 in the CB40 last season, and weighed in with nine wickets, as Essex advanced to the semi-finals - but England had no answers to his watertight technique and a shot selection that started out composed before <m19>exploding in the closing overs with 52 runs coming from his last 26 deliveries</m19>. <m20>He came to the crease in the 12th over</m20> and though <m21>he took 12 balls to get off the mark</m21>, the value in gauging the pace of the wicket paid off handsomely. #p#All told, <m22>ten Doeschate struck nine fours and three sixes in a 110-ball stay</m22>, <m23>the first of which came off a gentle full-toss from Kevin Pietersen</m23>, <m24>whose two overs were dispatched for 19</m24> and highlighted England's folly in omitting Yardy - Bopara's medium-pace was not called upon. <m25>Swann, on his return to the team following the birth of his son Wilfred, was the pick of England's bowlers with 2 for 35 in ten tidy overs</m25>, while Stuart Broad was menacing if a touch expensive in his first full international since the Adelaide Test in December. But <m26>ten Doeschate treated the rest of England's attack with disdain, as he powered through to his fourth and highest century</m26> in 28 appearances for the Netherlands. #p#<m27>After calling for the Powerplay in the 43rd over</m27>, <m28>ten Doeschate lost his fifth-wicket partner Tom de Grooth, the hero of Lord's 2009, who was bowled by a Broad yorker for 28</m28>. But undeterred, <m29>he picked off consecutive boundaries from Tim Bresnan to move through the nineties</m29>, before reaching <m30>his first World Cup hundred from 98 balls</m30> and in remarkable fashion, as <m31>a sharp single to short fine leg turned into five overthrows when Trott's shy ricocheted off the stumps and away to the ropes</m31>. #p#On a night that belonged to the Dutchmen in spite of the final result, <m32>the nadir of England's performance was reached in the final six overs of their bowling effort</m32>. Only last summer, England's attack was touted as their likeliest route to World Cup glory, given how intricately each member of the attack knew their roles, and how quickly they were able to react to changing circumstances. However, the closing overs were a total shambles that would have disgraced a club side, given the breadth and variety of the errors that were committed. #p#A foretaste of the chaos came <m33>in Swann's seventh over, when ten Doeschate, on 47, launched a drive into no-man's land behind the bowler's arm, where James Anderson and Kevin Pietersen converged from mid-off and mid-on respectively, but stopped dead as the ball plugged harmlessly between them.</m33> #p#Anderson's day then went from bad to worse when he returned to the attack <m34>in the 46th over. His attempt at blockhole bowling resulted in two awful waist-high full-tosses</m34>, <m35>the second of which swung away down the leg side for four</m35>. <m36>Both were called as no-balls</m36>, and Anderson was very fortunate not to be withdrawn from the attack by the umpires. Or not as it happens, because the Dutch captain Peter Borren was delighted he remained. <m37>He belted three consecutive boundaries in a listless ninth over, to finish unbeaten on 35 from 24 balls</m37>. #p#England's embarrassment didn't end there. Though <m38>Broad showed some fight to end ten Doeschate's stay via a catch in the deep in the 49th over</m38>, <m39>he was denied the wicket of Borren in the same over when Collingwood at midwicket failed to take his required position inside the fielding circle. A no-ball was signalled, Borren was recalled</m39>, and there was still time for one more howler, as <m40>Swann shelled a sitter at third man to reprieve Mudassar Bukhari</m40>. #p#<m41>Netherlands' final total of 292 for 6</m41> was their highest against a full-member nation, and the second highest by any Associate, beating the 230 they scored against England on this very day 15 years ago, at the 1996 World Cup. The hero that day was the 18-year-old Bas Zuiderent, who was the only Dutchman to miss out this time around, as <m42>he made 1 from 10 balls</m42> before <m43>becoming Swann's second victim</m43>. It was scant consolation for England on a day that they could not allow to get any worse. #p#<m44>The new opening pairing of Strauss and Pietersen went some way towards atoning for England's earlier errors with a 105-run stand in 17.4 overs</m44>. They started with clear intent as <m45>Strauss snaffled three fours in the first over, from Mudassar Bukhari - two clips off the toes and a fortuitous under-edged cut past off stump</m45>, en route to <m46>88 from 83 balls</m46>, while <m47>Pietersen's first shot was a sweetly timed drive to a Berend Westdijk outswinger</m47>. #p#On a slow deck, Pietersen's instinct was to advance onto the front foot at every opportunity, and his timing seemed in fine fettle even though he kept picking out the fielders in a well-drilled Netherlands outfit. <m48>Strauss meanwhile hung back in his crease and took advantage of the Dutch inexperience to nudge and pull eight of his first nine boundaries behind square on the leg-side.</m48> #p#However, as the hardness went out of the new ball and Barresi came up to the stumps to restrict Pietersen's footwork, his returns tailed off appreciably. <m49>Having scored 29 from his first 31 balls</m49>, <m50>he made just 10 from his next 30</m50>, before <m51>Pieter Seelaar added his name to the list of left-arm spinners to have captured one of the more notable scalps in world cricket. A tempting delivery was tossed up outside off stump, and Pietersen failed to get his feet to the pitch as he poked an uppish drive to short cover. </m51>#p#In the end humiliation was avoided, and given the lop-sided format of the World Cup, England have already made a significant stride towards the quarter-finals. But with the in-form Indians looming in Bangalore on Sunday, there is no room for another performance this poor. The world is watching and the likes of Virender Sehwag won't be losing sleep. #p#Match Timeline

Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: Graeme Swann Matches: England v Netherlands at Nagpur Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: England | Netherlands #p#Opening act. Graeme Swann is the best spinner in the world and he proved that again today. He started his World Cup campaign on the back of just a day's work in the nets (on Monday) having arrived late from England where he was attending to the birth of his first child. The distractions did not matter as <m1>he continued with the legacy of picking a wicket in his first over when he had the dangerous-looking Wesley Barresi stumped on his fourth delivery</m1>. It was 12th time Swann had picked a wicket in his first over in ODIs. #p#Six of the day. <m2>Ryan ten Doeschate's six off Graeme Swann</m2>. With his tendency to flight the ball Swann challenges the batsman to take him on, but the margin for error for his opponent is bare minimum. Still, ten Doeschate charged an off break, before smartly using his wrists to flick the ball over deep mid-wicket for <m3>his second six of the match in the 35th over</m3>, which opened the flood gates for the Dutch, as <m4>they ransacked 130 runs off the last 15 overs</m4>. #p#Drop of the day. <m5>A straightforward catch: ten Doeschate, on 47, stepped out against Swann to try and clear the straight boundary. He did not time it well as the ball went sky high. It seemed an easy picking for either of the men rushing in from long-on and long-off respectively: Jimmy Anderson and Kevin Pietersen. Yet for some unknown reason both men stopped suddenly, probably thinking the other would go for the catch. Embarrassingly the ball dropped in the yard that separated the two. Both walked back to their spots heads down. Swann stood at the wicket, hands on hips, staring unbelievingly at the gaffe.</m5> Look out for his twitter post later. #p#No cheer for England. <m6>Stuart Broad, brought back in the batting Powerplay, defeated Peter Borren with a lovely yorker with the bails flying high and wide. But just as the Dutch skipper was about the cross over the boundary rope, he was called back by the umpire because England had placed only three fielders inside the 30-yard circle.</m6> It was turning out to be an evening of blunders for the Ashes winners. It was Broad's turn to kick the ground in disgust. #p#Wake up Nagpur. The Orange were playing the orange city. Yet there was hardly any orange in the ground barring the colours worn by the Dutch team. About two thousand enthusiasts still turned up at the Vidarbha Cricket Association ground, which is located terribly outside the city limits. The fans did keep the tempo somewhat high in the afternoon when ten Doeschate stepped on the accelerator, but as the evening grew old the crowds fell silent. To wake them up the ground DJ used the 'shout meter' at the change of overs to increase the decibel level. #p#Seelar turns handball 'keeper. <m7>England needed 23 runs from the final three overs</m7>. <m8>Pieter Seelaar, the left-arm spinner bowled a straighter one, which Ravi Bopara stepped out and punched hard back down the ground. Seelar, in a moment of reflex, used his left ankle, as would a goalkeeper in a handball contest, to deflect the ball and convert a possible double into one.</m8> The Dutch remain inspired till the end with such spirited fielding that kept England on the edge throughout.

ESPNcricinfo Ltd Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: Ryan ten Doeschate Matches: England v Netherlands at Nagpur Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: England | Netherlands #p#It wasn't quite enough to win the match, but <m1>Ryan ten Doeschate's magnificent 119</m1>, and <m2>Netherlands' spirited batting which took them to 292</m2>, was clearly the talking point after the high-scoring game in Nagpur. There were many aspects to their innings which were impressive, and they set several memorable landmarks along the way. Despite all that, though, <m3>they couldn't prevent England from chasing down 293</m3> and achieving the third-highest successful run-chase in World Cups. Some of the highlights from the game: #p#<m4>Netherlands' total of 292 </m4>is their second-highest in World Cups, after the 314 for 4 they scored against Namibia in 2003. It's also the second-highest total conceded by England in World Cups: West Indies scored 300 against them in Barbados in 2007. #p#Netherlands' score is also the second-highest by an Associate member against a Test team in ODIs, after Zimbabwe's 312 for 4 against Sri Lanka in the 1992 World Cup. (See table 1) <m5>ten Doeschate's 119</m5> is also the second-highest by a batsman from an Associate team against a Test side in ODIs. The record stays with Dave Houghton, who scored an outstanding 142 in a losing cause against New Zealand in the 1987 World Cup. (See table 2) #p#The way Netherlands paced their innings was exemplary: their run-rate hovered at around 4.50 almost throughout their innings. <m6>After 40 overs, it was 4.70</m6>; <m7>after 50, it touched 5.84</m7>, thanks to the fact that <m8>the last ten overs fetched 104</m8>. The way ten Doeschate upped the tempo was equally impressive: <m9>at the end of the 40th over, he had scored 67 off 83</m9>. <m10>In his last 27 balls, he blasted 52, with five fours and a six</m10>. England's fielding was utterly shambolic, but they made up for it with a well-planned run-chase - their lowest run-rate throughout the entire innings was 5.30. #p#<m11>The century</m11> pushes ten Doeschate's overall ODI average to 71.21. In four World Cup innings, his scores read 57, 1, 70* and 119 - 247 runs at an average of 82.33. #p#With the ball coming on to the bat, the Netherland batsmen also did well to use the pace of the delivery to get the runs. <m12>Of the 27 fours they scored, only seven came in front of the wicket; the rest were all behind square on either side, often courtesy deft flicks and nudges</m12>. <m13>England's wagon-wheel was quite different, with 11 out of 24 fours in front of the wicket.</m13> #p#England's batting was generally impressive, but <m14>Kevin Pietersen's display wasn't entirely convincing. He needed 61 balls to score 39, and played out 41 dot balls</m14>, which is a third of the total dot in England's innings. Those numbers will need some improvement when England take on India in their next game. #p#Table 1: Highest scores by Associate teams v Full Members Team Score Versus Venue, year Zimbabwe 312 for 4 Sri Lanka New Plymouth, 1992 Kenya 285 for 9 Zimbabwe Nairobi, 2008 Kenya 284 for 7 Zimbabwe Bulawayo, 2006 Sri Lanka 276 for 4 Australia The Oval, 1975 Kenya 270 for 8 Zimbabwe Harare, 2009 #p#Table 2: Highest individual scores by an Associate against a Full Member Batsman Score Versus Venue, year Dave Houghton 142 New Zealand Hyderabad, 1987 Andy Flower 115* Sri Lanka New Plymouth, 1992 Jeremy Bray 115* Zimbabwe Kingston, 2007 John Davison 111 West Indies Centurion, 2003 William Porterfield 108 Bangladesh Belfast, 2010 Steve Tikolo 102 Zimbabwe Nairobi, 2008 Mehrab Hossain 101 Zimbabwe Dhaka, 1999 Innings Dot balls 4s 6s PP1 PP2 PP3 Last 10 overs NB/Wides Netherlands 150 27 3 47/1 18/1 50/1 104/2 3/2 England 124 24 1 53/0 39/0 34/2 74/2 0/11
5	502532	England v Netherlands, Group B, World Cup 2011, Nagpur	England save themselves Oranje faces	Dileep Premachandran at the VCA Stadium	February 22, 2011	#p#On the eve of this match, Andrew Strauss said: "How we win isn't as important as just winning." It will give him little satisfaction that his team took that literally, producing an unbelievably slipshod display in the field before Strauss and the rest of the batsman save themselves Oranje faces with a competent performance. #p#<m1>With four overs to go, England needed 33. They had six wickets in hand</m1>, so it wasn't quite squeaky-bum time, but it was close. Unfortunately for the Netherlands, they didn't have a Dirk Nannes or anyone of similar quality to put the foot on the throat. Ryan ten Doeschate, the star of the show, had bowled out, and Pieter Seelaar and Bernard Loots couldn't cope with the experience of Paul Collingwood and the <m2>free-stroking instinct of Ravi Bopara</m2>. #p#Four years ago, one of the Associate nations, Ireland, upset Pakistan at Sabina Park after a superb bowling display. The Netherlands failed to follow suit because they lacked that bit of quality with ball in hand. <m3>With Strauss and Kevin Pietersen starting so well</m3>, those that followed never had to take undue risks to chase down the runs. #p#Strauss spoke afterwards of how the team had come to Nagpur, "feeling comfortable and determined to start well", after an emphatic warm-up victory against Pakistan in Fatullah. But on a benign pitch where teams had crossed 300 thrice in four previous innings, the bowling plans were exposed. #p#Asked afterwards if the performance had been acceptable, Strauss said: "Certainly not with the ball and in the field. <m4>The last 10 overs</m4> were especially poor. We can't afford to drop that many chances. I thought 290 was far too many." #p#The quick bowlers had some success with the short ball early on, but were guilty of overusing it later in the innings. Once the ball had gone soft, it sat up and begged to be hit. Ten Doeschate and his team-mates duly obliged. #p#With no swing in the air and no reverse later on, James Anderson struggled right through. The length he bowled late on was perfect for the batsmen to have a swing at and there were too few yorkers, despite <m5>Stuart Broad taking two wickets</m5> by keeping it full. #p#"It was one of those pitches where it was hard to wrest momentum and hard to take wickets," said Strauss when asked to explain the pace bowlers' off-colour display. If there was a positive, he said, it was <m6>Graeme Swann, who bowled quite beautifully on his return to the side</m6>. "He was excellent, economical and threatening as well." #p#There were no teacups thrown, or TV sets smashed, in the dressing room at the interval, though Strauss did admit: "We were a little bit shell-shocked at what happened <m7>in the final 10 overs</m7>. #p#"I told the boys that the score wasn't that much above par. There was no point dwelling too much on what had happened. It was a bit of a shemozzle on the field." #p#<m8>Pietersen was guilty of trying to hit the ball too hard</m8> when England came out for the chase, but <m9>Strauss paced his 88 perfectly</m9>, making the most of far too many deliveries angled at his pads. The flick and glance were routinely used as the Netherlands let themselves down at a time when a wicket or two could have meant intolerable pressure. #p#As dismayed as he was with the first half of the game, Strauss was generous in his praise for the opposition. "You've got to give a lot of credit to the Netherlands," he said. "Ten Doeschate's done that a lot for Essex, but on the big stage it's a hard thing to do." #p#India await on Sunday, and as unconvincing as this performance was, both teams will start with two points. "Hopefully, India will take us lightly after this performance," said Strauss in a rare moment of levity. With Virender Sehwag and friends in such thumping form, being the unfancied underdog might just be England's best bet. That, and some extra pace and bounce in the Bangalore pitch.
5	502534	England v Netherlands, Group B, World Cup 2011, Nagpur	ten Doeschate sets inspiring example	Nagraj Gollapudi at the VCA Stadium	February 22, 2011	#p#At the mid-innings break <m1>Ryan ten Doeschate, a little weary after scoring the second-highest individual score (119)</m1> by an Associate player, said he was a touch disappointed because he could've done more. He need not have bothered. Today he played as a consummate batsman: his timing, his placement, his foot movement, his reflexes, his smart working of the field worked magnificently. There were no mis-hits, instead he played on the mistakes, of which there many, committed by the England bowlers. #p#It was an interesting scenario for the Netherlands and ten Doeschate. The Dutch, who rarely play against the top nations, could have started with a nothing-to-lose mindset. But for ten Doeschate, the ICC's Associate Player of the Year, there was a lot to stand up to. The South Africa-born ten Doeschate was adopted by Essex and brought to England by Graham Gooch, who was taken by his desire and dedication. ten Doeschate worked hard to improve his limited skills, and his discipline to do the things the right way paid off as he became indispensable at Essex as a batting allrounder. Today he had another chance show the world his talent. #p#He understood quickly it was a batting pitch and that the ball was coming slow on to the bat. The key was to not rush. With Graeme Swann and Paul Collingwood operating, it would've been tempting to charge them. But ten Doeschate remained patient. It did not matter <m2>he had not scored a run off his first 11 deliveries</m2>. <m3>The next one, angled down the leg side by Collingwood, ten Doeschate moved in and deflected it neatly past the fine-leg ropes for his first four.</m3> #p#The middle overs were the biggest litmus test for the Dutch because if they had failed to get the right sort of tempo in that interval, the platform raised earlier would have fallen down easily. "<m4>I did not strike well off the first 20 balls</m4>. The deck was very good but slightly slow," ten Doeschate said later. But he did not allow panic to set in. <m5>Courtesy Messrs Anderson and Pietersen, who failed to lap up an easy catch when he was on 47 against Swann</m5>, <m6>ten Doeschate got to his fifty quietly</m6>. The crowd was unaware. #p#<m7>The boundaries dried up between the overs 17 and 23</m7> and then again <m8>between 26 and 35</m8>. But not a single opportunity was missed to rotate the strike. That agility put pressure on England, who were shocking in the field. <m9>Swann had bowled eight overs and had controlled ten Doeschate admirably</m9>. <m10>In Swann's penultimate over, ten Doeschate finally got in a good position to hit a handsome six over deep midwicket</m10>. The frustration of the dropped catch in the previous over got to Swann and he kicked the ground in disgust. #p#Swann's exit allowed the Dutch to assume control. Anderson and Collingwood returned and were erratic. <m11>The Dutch cleverly delayed taking the batting Powerplay, which they eventually went for in the 43rd over</m11>. <m12>Fifty runs were looted in those five overs for the loss of just one wicket and ten Doeschate's contribution was 26</m12>. In the end a stiff target was raised. England, as Andrew Strauss, declared later were "shell-shocked" #p#If England were still confident, it was because of the flat pitch and the modest Dutch bowling. But it was once again ten Doeschate who bowled wicket to wicket mostly and kept a fuller length to deny England any easy route to victory. He had the larger say in the field settings and constantly egged the bowlers to bowl a disciplined line. But he knew even 293 was not going to be sufficient. #p#"We got the pace slightly wrong in the middle overs," ten Doeschate said. "We thought 230-240 would be good score, so we set our marker to 270 but if we had worked a little harder, may be, we could have got to 310. When we do come across a good deck like that and when you do get a good team on the back foot you do need to put your foot on the gas a bit early." #p#You could sense how deep the loss had hurt him. But he couldn't do much. He was disappointed with the Dutch bowling but was not complaining. The frustrations of playing with a mostly-amateur side were obvious. Therefore, <m13>ten Doeschate's century</m13> today is an important one. Also the timing cannot be lost: the ICC have all but told the Associates that their time is up in the World Cup. The moot question is how do we measure a performance like ten Doeschate's today? He played like a professional, locked horns with a superior opposition and came out on top. #p#At 30, ten Doeschate is too old to use an innings like today's to audition himself for England or South Africa. But today he was not pondering about his future. "Personally it is about as close to a perfect innings as I want to play in one-day cricket," he said. "As a team we can take so much away from the game: not only <m14>my hundred</m14>, other guys, too, scrapped 180 runs together at a pretty good whack. We want to play brave cricket and not worry about the outcome and tonight was a perfect example of that." #p#At the end of it all one picture remained fresh. Two men sat on their haunches at one corner of the pitch. Peter Borren had his head down. ten Doeschate was consoling him. The feeling on being so near, yet so far, could not escape their minds. The roles in that picture should have been reversed - Borren, the Netherlands captain, putting his arm across ten Doeschate, the man who had cracked one of the best centuries coming from an Associate nation, and later bowled with intensity despite suffering cramps at the halfway stage. #p#But ten Doeschate, one of the only three professionals in the Dutch squad, knows the rest of the players look up to him for guidance and inspiration. He had not let them down. He will do his best in the last five matches the Netherlands play in a World Cup.

Players/Officials: Ahmed Shehzad | Mohammad Hafeez | Shahid Afridi | Umar Akmal Matches: Kenya v Pakistan at Hambantota Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Pakistan #p#The emergence of Ahmed Shehzad has settled down Pakistan's opening partnership for the near future, but it has complicated matters for the rest of the batting order. Shehzad partnered Mohammad Hafeez at the top in the ODI series win over New Zealand coming into the World Cup. Both players had successful series, notching up a maiden century each but didn't put on a significant partnership in any of the five games they batted together. #p#Shehzad's return has meant Kamran Akmal moving down one spot to No. 3 in the order. But Akmal and Hafeez formed a successful partnership in the ODI series against England last September and would, in all likelihood, have been the first-choice pair here had it not been for Akmal's brief exile from the side in between. That absence allowed Shehzad to return to the side for the first time since 2009, an opportunity he has fully utilised. #p#Hafeez has also been a stabilising influence since his own return to the ODI set-up last summer, averaging 35.73 in 16 ODIs since then, with a hundred and three fifties. He has also turned in useful spells of offspin, picking up 11 wickets. Hafeez and Shehzad will start as the opening pair but the pushing down of Akmal and the return of Misbah-ul-Haq in a middle order that also includes Younis Khan often resulted in Pakistan not gathering enough momentum in the middle overs of an innings. #p#Pakistan are keen on keeping both Younis and Misbah in the XI as insurance against collapses. But batting them at four and five as happened in New Zealand has meant that Umar Akmal, potentially Pakistan's best batsman in the format, has come in with too few overs left to have an impact. It is an issue that will require flexibility, said Pakistan's captain Shahid Afridi ahead of their tournament opener against Kenya. #p#"If we lose the first wicket early, then Kamran, who has been an attacking batsman and has opened, comes in so we will have advantage with him and fielders in the circle," Afridi said. "After that it will depend on how many overs we have so Umar can come after Younis. We don't want Misbah and Younis batting together so that we can keep momentum and the scoreboard ticking." #p#Pakistan also look set to include Shoaib Akhtar in the line-up for Wednesday, despite concerns over his match fitness; only yesterday coach Waqar Younis said Shoaib was improving but not fully fit just yet. That means Saeed Ajmal is likely to miss out as Pakistan open up with three fast bowlers. Junaid Khan, the late call-up who impressed in a warm-up game against England in Dhaka and has experience of Hambantota, will also probably sit out. Irrespective of the opponent, Afridi said, Pakistan will be at full strength. #p#"I don't think it's an easier game for us," he said. "The first game is always very important for us. There are a number of examples where big teams have lost so we want to be at full strength." #p#Pakistan chose not to train on Tuesday, having arrived in Hambantota on Monday and undergone a distinctly energetic and enthusiastic practice session soon after arriving. Afridi acknowledged there was more attention on off-field issues surrounding the side but maintained that a semi-final place was a realistic target. "I take that as challenge that no one is considering us for the semi-final. I want to see my team in the semi-finals."
6	502507	Kenya v Pakistan, Group A, World Cup 2011, Hambantota	Can Kenya challenge Pakistan?	The Preview by Sriram Veera	February 22, 2011	#p#Match Facts #p#February 23, Hambantota Start time 14:30 local time (09:00 GMT) #p#Misbah-ul-Haq symoblises Pakistan's spirit AFP Enlarge Related Links News : Pakistan look for flexibility in batting order News : Tikolo confident of Kenyan revival Matches: Kenya v Pakistan at Hambantota Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Kenya | Pakistan #p#Big Picture It's not the exciting Umar Akmal, the marauding Shahid Afridi, the blaster Abdul Razzaq, or the volatile Shoaib Akthar who captures the essence of this Pakistan team but the back-from-the-dead Misbah-ul-Haq. He was never supposed to be here, back playing international cricket. He was plagued by form issues, was not growing any younger, and just when you thought he was history, Pakistan made him the Test captain. They said he will prove a bad investment, that he will roll up and surrender but what did he do? He kept scoring fifties, also sparkled in the ODIs against New Zealand and nearly became the ODI captain. In many ways, the Pakistan team is like him. Spot-fixing, aging stars, cocky youngsters and loss of good bowlers to controversies should have rendered them impotent, but they are the dark horse in this tournament. #p#Pakistan showed in New Zealand that they like to play the game the 80's way: Start steady, build during the middle overs and explode in the end. They have Misbah and Younis Khan to build, the Akmal brothers and the Afridi-Razzaq combination to finish in style but in Ahmed Shehzad they have unearthed someone who can provide them with a fiery start. The loss of Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Amir might hurt their Test team but Umar Gul, Wahab Riaz, Shoaib and the canny spinners Abdur Rehman and Saeed Ajmal have enough skill in them to keep their ODI bandwagon up and running in style. #p#For their part, Kenya are trying to breathe after the demolition under the hands of New Zealand. For what it's worth, it could be the best thing that happened to them. Now they would know there is no point in trying to play a safe game and meander towards defeat. They were nervous in the first game, never dared to express themselves, and sunk without a trace. Even in that performance, there was evidence that they possess a few batsmen with some flair. Collins Obuya flirted, albeit briefly, with flamboyance, Steve Tikolo will be itching to script a memorable swan song, Alex Obanda is an attacking batsman and the young Seren Waters seems to possess the skill required to belong at this level. They beat Netherlands in a friendly in Dubai and lost a close game in a warm-up encounter in this tournament. You feel they are a much better team than the outfit that turned up against New Zealand. Can they shed their big-stage nerves? #p#Form guide (Most recent first for the last five completed games) #p#Pakistan : LWWWL Kenya : LWLWL #p#Pitch and conditions It looks a typical subcontinental batting track and a run feast is expected. #p#Watch out for  Seren Waters reminded one of Kane Williamson: Compact, technically correct and in this day and age, showed an almost old-fashioned preference to get completely behind the line of deliveries. His captain rates him as the batsman who has got the skill and the inclination to bat long. #p#Ahmed Shehzad provides the much-needed fire at the top order. He loves to loft straight and frequently uses the fierce mow over midwicket as his go-to shot under pressure. His 115 against New Zealand in the last series also showed that he was willing to be cautious against the moving ball, under conditions which demanded that, before counter-attacking his way out of trouble. If he can continue to show such judicious shot selections, he can help Pakistan launch solid starts. #p#Team news #p#Pakistan are keen on playing both Younis and Misbah in the XI but Afridi suggested that they might not be played at No.4 and 5 to ensure the run-rate doesn't slacken. It's also learnt that Shoaib Akhtar will be given a go despite concerns over his form. #p#Pakistan (probable): 1 Mohammad Hafeez, 2 Ahmad Shahzad, 3 Kamran Akmal (wk), 4 Younis Khan, 5 Umar Akmal, 6 Misbah-ul-Haq, 7 Shahid Afridi (capt), 8 Abdur Razzaq, 9 Umar Gul, 10 Wahab Riaz, 11 Shoaib Akhtar #p#Kenya captain Jimmy Kamande got hit on the side of the head by a ball in practice and there was some swelling, but he is expected to play tomorrow. #p#Kenya (probable) 1 Seren Waters, 2 Alex Obanda, 3 Collins Obuya, 4 Rakep Patel, 5 Steve Tikolo, 6 Maurice Ouma (wk), 7 Jimmy Kamande (capt), 8 Thomas Odoyo, 9 James Ngoche, 10 Shem Ngoche, 11 Nehemiah Odhiambo #p#Try picking the XIs for tomorrow's game by playing Team Selector. #p#Stats and trivia #p#Pakistan and Kenya have faced each other five times with Pakistan winning all the encounters.

Getty Images Enlarge Related Links News : Pakistan make a statement Players/Officials: Shahid Afridi | Umar Akmal Matches: Kenya v Pakistan at Hambantota Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Kenya | Pakistan #p#Kenya again appeared totally out of their depth and posed no challenge to Pakistan at Hambantota, <m10>Collins Obuya's death-or-glory 47</m7> being the only highlight for them as <m11>Shahid Afridi helped himself to 5 for 16</m11> in a massive <m12>205-run win</m12>, Pakistan's biggest win in World Cups and the eighth largest overall. #p#Four of Pakistan's batsmen cashed in to raise half-centuries and set up <m13>a total of 317 for 7</m13> after a brief wobble against the new ball and Kenya made little effort to mount a serious challenge in their pursuit, rather looking to a lay a solid platform in the hope of batting out their full quota of overs. That ultimately proved a futile effort, too, although <m14>their innings did at least last until the 34th over</m14> - longer than their entire match against New Zealand three days ago. #p#Kenya's slide began in earnest when <m15>Afridi brought himself on and, in his third over, tempted Steve Tikolo down the pitch only for the ball to rush straight on to rattle the stumps.</m15> <m16>Kenya were 73 for 3 in the 23rd over</m16> when Tikolo was dismissed, without any real hope of chasing more than 300 but at least looking steady enough to last the full 50 after the top order had showed at least a little grit. There was no such offering from the middle, however, as <m17>the remaining seven wickets fell for just 39 runs in just over ten overs</m17>. #p#Afridi was the chief wrecking ball, <m18>quickly ending a bustling innings from Tanmay Mishra</m18> and <m19>making short work of Jimmy Kamande and Thomas Odoyo as he unfurled a mixed bag of legbreaks, sliders and quicker ones</m19> as the ball began to bite and spit off the surface. Amid the carnage, <m20>Obuya opened up to smite three enormous sixes</m20> but <m21>was caught on the boundary attempting a fourth</m21> to give Afridi the best figures by a Pakistan bowler in a World Cup, beating Wasim Akram's 5 for 28 against Namibia in Kimberley at the 2003 tournament. Once he went, the end was mercifully quick in coming. #p#Ultimately they flattered to deceive, but against expectations Kenya had actually bossed the opening exchanges of the match, <m22>Thomas Odoyo and Elijah Otieno showing admirable control with the new ball</m22>. <m23>Otieno provided the first breakthrough when Hafeez tried to force a length delivery into the leg side but hit it uppishly and Seren Waters, at straight midwicket, leapt to his left and managed to cling onto a juggled catch mere inches from the turf</m23>. <m24>In the very next over Shehzad, who had scratched around for 17 balls that yielded just a single run, chipped a leading edge to give Jimmy Kamande a simple catch at mid-off and Pakistan were in some serious strife</m24>. #p#The pressure soon began to lift, however, <m25>Kamran Akmal and Younis Khan quickly settling</m25> and <m26>Nehemiah Odhiambo suffering a shambolic start to his spell as 16 runs came from a first over that included three no-balls</m26>. Kamran proved the more fluent of the two early in his innings but Younis provided sensible support and, as the spinners came on, plenty of ones and twos were taken to keep the score ticking over. #p#Smart Stats. There were four fifty-plus scores in Pakistan's innings, which is the joint highest for the number of fifty-plus scores in a team innings in World Cups. <m27>Pakistan's 317</m27> is their highest score in ODIs against Kenya, surpassing their previous best of 286 in Sharjah in 2003. It is also their fourth-highest total in World Cups. <m28>Kenya conceded 46 extras</m28>, which is the fourth-highest on the list of most extras conceded by a team in a World Cup match. <m29>The 37 wides they conceded</m29> equals the world record in all ODIs. <m30>Misbah-ul-Haq scored his fourth half-century</m30> in 11 innings since August 2009. In the same period, he has scored 428 runs at an average of 47.55, which is much higher than his career average of 40.48. <m31>Pakistan scored 112 runs in the last ten overs of their innings</m31>, including <m32>70 runs in the batting powerplay</m32>. South Africa hold the record for most runs in the last ten overs in ODIs since 2000, with 146 runs against Pakistan at Centurion in 2007. <m33>The 205-run win</m33> is Pakistan's largest margin of victory in World Cup matches and also Kenya's worst defeat in World Cups. The 112 is Kenya's third-lowest score in World Cup matches. Their lowest is the 69 against New Zealand in the opening match of the 2011 World Cup. #p#<m34>Kamran eased past 50, from 62 balls</m34>, and looked set for plenty more before <m35>he charged down the wicket to left-arm spinner Shem Ngoche and was easily stumped</m35>. Kenya were buzzing once more with the breakthrough, but despite giving a far a far better account of themselves than they had against New Zealand at Chennai they lacked the necessary firepower to land the killer blow. #p#<m36>Misbah-ul-Haq opened his World Cup account with a massive six off Tikolo</m36> and rushed into the 20s at better than a-run-a-ball to complement the more circumspect <m37>Younis, who showed the value of steady accumulation before he was dismissed lbw for exactly 50 despite an optimistic review</m37>. #p#<m38>Misbah and Umar Akmal were barely troubled as they set about compiling a 118 runs for the fifth wicket</m38>, their partnership exploding into life as the <m39>Batting Powerplay was called for in the 44th over</m39> immediately after <m40>Misbah had reached fifty on his World Cup debut</m40>. <m41>Umar thrashed 20 off a weary Otieno's seventh over</m41> and soon <m42>sprinted to the fourth fifty of the innings as the score passed 250 in the 46th over</m42>. With Pakistan now swinging from the hip at just about everything, Kenya picked up regular wickets but threatened to unravel completely in the face of an all-out assault. #p#<m43>Odoyo removed Umar and Afridi from consecutive deliveries to find himself on a hat-trick in the 49th over</m43> but <m44>speared the next ball acres down the leg side</m44> and <m45>repeated the blunder later in the same over</m45> as battle fatigue set in. <m46>Extras, with 46</m46>, very nearly became the fifth half-century maker of the innings as Kenya had the ignominious honour of equalling the record for most wides in a one-day international, and there was a visible sense of relief as they finally completed their stint in the field. #p#Their efforts with the bat quickly put their failures with the ball in the shade, however, and Kenya will need a complete overhaul if they are to challenge anyone in this tournament. At the other end of the spectrum, Pakistan will be pleased with a generally slick and professional performance that has set their campaign off on an overwhelmingly positive note. #p#Match Timeline
6	502651	Kenya v Pakistan, World Cup 2011, Hambantota	Misbah does a Gooch, and school's out	Osman Samiuddin in Hambantota	February 23, 2011	Sweeps and reverse-sweeps were Misbah's favourite strokes. AFP Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: Misbah-ul-Haq | Thomas Odoyo | Seren Waters Matches: Kenya v Pakistan at Hambantota Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Kenya | Pakistan #p#Catch of the day. <m1>Seren Waters' effort to send back Mohammad Hafeez would've done the world's greatest goalkeepers proud. Hafeez's clip went well to the left of Waters at short midwicket, but a full length aerial dive saw him grasp on. Even then the job was half done; as he landed the ball bobbled out of his hand, bounced off his forearm, only for him to clutch it with his left.</m1> Less than a week into the tournament, it'll be difficult to better it. #p#Best Reverse 'Graham Gooch World Cup 1987 semi-final' impersonation of the day. In slightly less grand circumstances than the Wankhede, <m2>Misbah-ul-Haq reversed a leaf from Graham Gooch's strategy of the day by reverse-sweeping everything that came his way or at least every six balls or so. In a 69-ball innings, he reverse-swept seven times and attempted four conventional ones as well.</m2> Given the opposition, he probably didn't need to. #p#Favourite school lesson of the day. Given the hosts' absence and the fact that the stadium is as easy to reach as Atlantis, local authorities resorted to the oldest trick in the subcontinent, shipping in thousands of uniformed school children to occupy the tiered stands. A handy day off, bang in the middle of the week, beats geography any day. As the day progressed and the harshness of the sun lessened and the gates were opened for all, however, a handy trickle of older fans started coming through, including the arrival of Pakistan's Chacha Cricket. #p#Least attractive innings of the day. Extras. Pakistan's innings had four half-centuries of varying aesthetics, but the worst was <m3>the 46 directly contributed by Kenya's bowlers</m3>, of which <m4>a whopping 37 were wides</m4>. That is the joint-highest wides conceded in an innings ever, equaling the 37 the West Indies conceded, also against Pakistan in January 1989 in Brisbane. Forty-six is the fifth-highest score by extras. #p#Worst hat-trick ball of the day. <m5>Thomas Odoyo's wickets off two successive balls in the 49th over</m5> didn't make much of a difference to Pakistan's charge but a hat-trick would've been a nice, individual feat. <m6>Having had Umar Akmal caught at long-on</m6> and then <m7>a successful referral against Shahid Afridi for leg-before</m7>, things were nicely set up. <m8>In came Odoyo, glory in his eyes, and duly bowled a miserable wide two feet down the leg-side</m8>.
6	502679	Kenya v Pakistan, World Cup 2011, Hambantota	Pakistan make a statement	Osman Samiuddin in Hambantota	February 23, 2011	#p#An entirely different proposition awaits Pakistan on Saturday but given how poorly they often start big tournaments, the comprehensive thumping of Kenya is likely to have pleased the team management more than they will let on. #p#The only slip was the stilted start to their innings, on a pitch which did a little more than expected. But four middle-order fifties, a successful implementation of their trademark ODI batting plan (build first, blast later), <m1>the captain's five-fer</m1> and some lively fielding made for an unexpectedly smooth start. The selection of Abdur Rehman over Saeed Ajmal, or even Wahab Riaz seemed puzzlingly defensive - Ajmal and Riaz are wicket-takers and they will need them in this campaign - but Pakistan maintained the intensity in the field they had shown in a quite electric practice session on Monday. #p#Then the younger men in particular had thrown themselves into fielding practice, yapping away, diving and leaping around, hitting stumps, taking good catches. Keeping things at that pitch was Waqar Younis, the coach himself, screaming for catches to be taken as if they were off his own bowling, throwing gloves down in disgust at misfields, not putting up with slackers, taking time out for fresh faces and generally making sure things ran precisely to plan. #p#It is what Pakistan's demanding followers say they always want, even if in defeat: spirit, fight, passion and energy. "The way we practiced, we were very focused and positive and what we do there, we deliver in the games as well," Shahid Afridi said. "We try to focus on practice sessions and don't waste our time. The coaches are doing a great job with the fast bowlers and the senior players are helping the young batsmen." #p#So, despite having 300-plus to defend, Afridi insisted the team go out and defend much less. "We wanted to make a big total and when we went in, I told the team that we are defending 120, we need to fight like we are defending 120, because tough matches lie ahead." #p#In those tough matches the middle order will not be allowed to rebuild as freely as they did here if the start is squandered. The concern over Ahmed Shehzad and Mohammad Hafeez's contributions were not so much with the score as the tentative manner in which they came: <m2>the former made a single from 18 balls</m2>. #p#The pair has been in good form recently, scoring fluently so the sudden, sharp dip and the nature of it concerned Afridi as well. "Whether in batting or bowling you need a positive start always," he said. "The ball was sticking to the pitch a little, so it wasn't so easy but we need to stick to our strengths and play positively. The start is always important and I'm confident our openers will not repeat these mistakes. Shehzad and Hafeez are positive players so hopefully they will change their style in the next game." #p#Good starts guarantee nothing of course and nobody forgets that Pakistan's two world titles have come when campaigns have stuttered at the beginning. Nevertheless in a week in which several big sides have made statements against associate nations, Pakistan have put in their own. "Definitely it emphasises that we are a dangerous team. It's a good start but we shouldn't be 100% satisfied because there is a lot of work ahead of us still."
6	502731	Kenya v Pakistan, World Cup 2011, Hambantota	Baptiste confident Kenya can lift game	ESPNcricinfo staff	February 24, 2011	#p#Kenya coach Eldine Baptiste has said that Kenya need to go back to the basics after they suffered a huge <m1>205-run defeat</m1> against Pakistan in their opening World Cup game in Hambantota on Monday. #p#"We were not up to the mark in all three departments and in cricket whatever you do you have to stick to the basics, and when you play a team like Pakistan or any international side you don't spurn your good starts. #p#"It's about being persistent and at the moment we are just not doing that." #p#<m2>Kenya started strongly after Pakistan chose to bat, picking up two wickets within the first seven overs</m2> but lost the initiative after that. <m3>Kamran Akmal and Younis Khan added 98 runs for the third wicket</m3> to steady Pakistan and <m4>Misbah-ul Haq and Umar Akmal put on 118 runs at almost nine runs an over</m4> to take the game away from Kenya. Kenya also conceded <m5>a whopping 46 extras</m5>, including <m6>37 wides</m6>. #p#"We did show some improvement from the last game against New Zealand as we started well bowling-wise in the first 25 overs, but again we slipped in the middle and were very poor in the end." #p#Faced with a daunting target of 318, <m7>Kenya's batsmen wilted with only Collins Obuya offering some resistance with 47</m7>. None of the other batsmen made more than 20, and five batsmen failed to get off the mark as <m8>Kenya were bowled out for 112 in just over 33 overs</m8>. However, Baptiste, who took over as the coach in September 2009, was confident Kenya would be able to lift themselves up for their next game against co-hosts Sri Lanka. #p#"On the big stage I know these boys can do that, and I have to drive the confidence in them for the remaining four matches. When I took the job I knew the enormity of it and I know that I have to go and get the 15 guys to revive their self-belief, because you cannot play cricket like that." #p#Baptiste said Kenya's poor showing was not a justification of the ICC's decision to trim the number of teams in the next World Cup in 2015 to 10 from the existing 14. #p#"What is the reality? The reality is that we have played two bad games and that's easy to say that, but you have to look at the way Holland played." #p#The Netherlands pushed England hard in their clash in the Nagpur after a hundred from Ryan ten Doeschate powered them to an impressive 292 for 6. England squeezed home by six wickets with just eight balls remaining. #p#"So when we play bad games, it's no credit, but when we play well they must give credit. Cricket is a funny game and we can stage a comeback, provided we stick to basics," said Baptiste. #p#Kenya play Sri Lanka in Colombo on March 1.
6	502769	Australia v New Zealand, Group A, World Cup 2011, Nagpur	Can Ponting lead Australia out of their spin woes?	The Preview by Sriram Veera	February 24, 2011	#p#Match Facts #p#February 25, Nagpur Start time: 09:30 local time (04:00 GMT) #p#Where are the runs hidden? Associated Press Enlarge Related Links Matches: Australia v New Zealand at Nagpur | Kenya v Pakistan at Hambantota Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Australia | New Zealand #p#Big Picture #p#It's almost as if there is malicious glee that follows Australia's so-called decline. Ashes lost? Yay! Ricky Ponting accidentally breaks a TV set? What irresponsible behaviour! Australia are struggling against spinners? Wonderful! In some ways, it's human nature to gloat at Goliath's fall. At the centre of the storm is Ponting, trying hard to regain his batting form, trying to hide the Ashes blot in his CV with another World-Cup triumph. In Australia's previous victorious campaigns, Ponting has led from the front with the bat but this time a question mark hovers around that possibility. Australia's campaign in this edition of the World Cup could well revolve around Ponting's form at No. 3. He got couple of hard-earned fifties in the warm-up games and looked to be slowly progressing towards recovering his touch. #p#The bowling is led by another ageing campaigner, Brett Lee, who is scripting a remarkable comeback. Much has been written about Australia's attack which stands out for its naked violence. The feeling is that they will either scythe through the opposition or fail to control the run-flow on these batting tracks. #p#On the other side, there is New Zealand, who are playing this game under the grim background of the Christchurch earthquake. "For a lot of the guys, coming to training has allowed them to take their mind off things," Daniel Vettori said. New Zealand have had a poor build-up to the World Cup, but they started the tournament with a crushing win against Kenya. Their batting line-up looks quite strong with the likes of Brendon McCullum, Martin Guptill, Jesse Ryder, Ross Taylor and Scott Styris and it's their bowling which looks a bit iffy. Will their seamers be able to adapt to these tracks? Much will depend on spinners Vettori and Nathan McCullum, who is likely to open the bowling with the new ball. New Zealand will hope that the pitch will take some turn and they can poke at Australia's vulnerability against spin on these slow tracks. It should be an interesting battle. #p#Form guide (Most recent first for the last five completed games) Australia : WWWWL New Zealand : LWLLL #p#Watch out for  Shane Watson's revival began here in India during the inaugural edition of the IPL. He adapted brilliantly and transformed himself into a smashing opener and took that form and confidence to the international stage. On Indian tracks, he likes to get on the front foot and scythe through the line. With Brad Haddin yet to learn the art of converting starts and with Ponting yet to get a regain his form completely, much will depend on Watson to set a solid platform. #p#Nathan McCullum is not a bowler who causes sleepless nights to batsmen but he could play a crucial role if Vettori decides to give him the new ball. He is accurate and spins the ball just enough to pose some problems. How he handles the pressure of bowling against Watson, Haddin and co might well decide how New Zealand fare with the ball. #p#Team news New Zealand have chosen their playing 12. Kyle Mills, Kane Williamson, and Luke Woodcock will miss out. #p#New Zealand (probable): 1 Martin Guptill, 2 Brendon McCullum (wk), 3 Jesse Ryder, 4 Ross Taylor, 5 James Franklin, 6 Scott Stryis, 7 Jacob Oram, 8 Daniel Vettori, 9 Nathan McCullum, 10 Hamish Bennett, 11 Tim Southee #p#Australia (probable) 1 Shane Watson, 2 Brad Haddin (wk), 3 Ricky Ponting (capt), 4 Michael Clarke, 5 David Hussey, 6 Cameron White, 7 Steve Smith, 8 Mitchell Johnson, 9 Jason Krezja, 10 Brett Lee, 11 Shaun Tait. #p#Try picking the XIs for tomorrow's game by playing Team Selector. #p#Stats and trivia #p#Ricky Ponting is the player who has played the most World Cup games. He has played 40 matches, going past Glenn McGrath's 39 appearances. He has also led Australia 23 times, the second-highest by any World Cup captain, after New Zealand's Stephen Fleming (27). Australia are yet to lose a World Cup game under Ponting. #p#In the game against Zimbabwe, Ponting became the fourth batsman in the World Cup to be run out on five occasions. The others are: Inzamam-ul-Haq (9), Asanka Gurusinha (6) and Javed Miandad (5) #p#Australia have faced New Zealand 123 times and have won 84 games. In India, these two teams have played against each other seven times, with Australia victorious in all seven. #p#Quotes #p#"Nothing really changes from any team you're playing in the subcontinent, you try and bowl straight at the wickets and you know you're going to have to score a lot of runs. There's no mystery to what we're going to try to do, but the key when you come up against these big teams and big players is having the presence of mind to execute time and time again. That's the toughest thing when you're coming up against good players." #p#Daniel Vettori on facing Australia
7	502498	West Indies v South Africa, World Cup 2011, Delhi	Dwayne Bravo certain of quarter-final qualification	Sharda Ugra in Delhi	February 22, 2011	#p#The group in which the West Indies finds themselves in this World Cup is not quite the football-esque Group of Death, but it could well be called a Cluster of Calamity. Where on any given day, a team that is highly-favoured, generously-rated, strongly-supported could find its plans, dreams and ambitions, upended. To whittle down the company that West Indies keep along with India, South Africa, England, Bangladesh, Ireland and Netherlands into four quarter-finalists is tougher than getting Sreesanth to separate his bowling from his bravado. #p#West Indies' allrounder Dwayne Bravo, though, has a different point of view, "I have no doubt in my mind we are going to qualify for the second round. And obviously, take it from there." It is a declaration through which Bravo has painted a target on his back two days before he gets out on the Ferozshah Kotla to play West Indies' first World Cup match against South Africa. Bravo did so by dismissing the idea that his team's group was tougher than the one made up of Sri Lanka, Australia, Pakistan, New Zealand, Zimbabwe, Kenya and Canada. "It's an open tournament and both groups have teams who can spring surprises and that's what the World Cup wants - one of the big teams being surprised by one of the under-rated teams." #p#West Indies are one of those under-rated teams, particularly since the last time they beat a Test team in an ODI was in June 2009. Since then, they have been beaten in their last two series at home by Bangladesh (0-3) and South Africa (0-5), both of whom they will meet in this group. It is as if the Gods are mocking the form book, destiny and whatever else can be mocked. #p#The series against South Africa, says Bravo, could have been "4-1 in the West Indies' favour" and in hindsight, it spelt out his side's biggest flaw: "We had a lot of opportunities, a lot of key moments that could have won us the games. But it was simple mistakes that cost us. We have identified those mistakes. We have to come up with good game plans as to how if those those situations do occur again, we will be more prepared to facing them." #p#Bravo's own form in the run-up to the World Cup has been iffy, with only one fifty in his last ten games, but he said he was now "confident and happy" after his brief run in the rain-drenched ODI series in Sri Lanka. "I am waiting for the tournament to begin, it will be a long one and I have a big role to play with bat and ball." Two days ago, Chris Gayle said Bravo was a factor because he brought "fireworks" to the team. "He get that buzz around and bring that energy... Regardless of what is happening, I'm not too worried about him, he will be ready to go when the umpire says play." For his part, Bravo says, "We can't wait for Thursday to come." #p#Gayle and Bravo make up two of the trio who turned down central contracts offered to them by the West Indies Cricket Board, giving themselves the opportunity to be freelance Twenty20 players in leagues mushrooming around the world. They may be in the same corner of a debate, but Bravo believes they must also share a common load in the World Cup. Not just because they are IPL regulars but also due to their all-round abilities. "Allrounders are very important in this part of the world and we have four top-quality allrounders. The captain Darren Sammy is one, Kieron Pollard, myself and Chris Gayle. On any given day if two of us out of the four have a good day, the West Indies will be in a good position to win games." #p#The IPL's insider information was not going to be enormous, Bravo said, because "it's the same information that Graeme Smith or J P Duminy will have." What could give the West Indians a slight advantage was the similarity of the conditions in the sub-continent to their home pitches, but this, too, only when compared to "some of the other teams who play on hard bouncy surfaces. #p#"Once we play properly and execute our plans properly, that obviously is going to come into play... knowing India, spin and slow-medium play a big part and we will also take that into consideration." #p#The West Indies' recent form and rankings were dismissed as 'history' with Bravo distilling the news, the noise and the predictions into one simple idea: "This is a new tournament in a different setting. Each team starts with zero points and every team has an opportunity to win the World Cup." #p#The match against South Africa will be the first 'marquee' contest of the World Cup not featuring any of the home teams. The West Indies would want to light a few fires under a few chairs in their group, "because we have to begin well...we don't want to be in the middle of the tournament where we are trying to play catch up cricket. We are not in a position where we can take it easy at the moment as we are rebuilding and trying to get back into winning ways... this tournament is important to us and the people of the Caribbean." #p#The people of the Caribbean will no doubt also keep Bravo's promise of a quarter-final spot in mind.
7	502509	West Indies v South Africa, World Cup 2011, Delhi	West Indies play down historical edge	Firdose Moonda in Delhi	February 22, 2011	Chris Gayle has given South Africa a tough time in ICC tournaments. AFP Enlarge Related Links News : Dwayne Bravo certain of quarter-final qualification. Matches: South Africa v West Indies at Delhi Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: South Africa | West Indies #p#It was 15 years and four World Cups ago that Brian Lara battered South Africa into submission. They had dominated the group stage of the World Cup, winning every match and then they ran into him. He smashed 111 off 94 balls, and received few other valuable contributions from the rest of the order that helped West Indies amass 264 for 8. South Africa were stunned and not even intent from Andrew Hudson, aggression from Daryll Cullinan and fight from Pat Symcox could take them over the line. #p#Seven years later, that same Lara blasted South Africa's dreams somewhere onto Table Mountain. With each of the 12 fours and two sixes that came off his bat that day, a small part of South African hope drifted up, up and away. In the end, his 116 was part of a very gettable score of 278 for 5 that the West Indies posted, and it was the Caribbean bowlers bowlers who burnt the last remaining bit of ambition South Africa had to win their World Cup opener on home soil and scattered the ashes all over the Cape coast. #p#Four years after that, in a different tournament, the World Twenty20, Chris Gayle threatened to do the same, this time planting South Africa's goals onto Corlett Drive in Johannesburg - quite literally. Gayle became the first man to score a century in Twenty20 cricket, his 117 came at a strike rate of over 200 and he propelled the West Indies to a score that has not been bettered in the format to that date. South Africa faced another defeat in the opening match of a major competition but this time the West Indian bowlers were not up for it and the hosts won albeit after receiving an almighty scare. #p#More than three years have passed and the two teams have another date. It's not a tournament opener in South Africa, but it is the first match either side will play in this competition. "It's a new tournament and it's in a different setting," as Dwayne Bravo said, but it's still a small slice of history that can be used as inspiration to one of the teams and a warning to the other, despite all that has changed since 1996. #p#The West Indies have lost 169 of the 320 matches they've played since then, more than half, including six ODI series to South Africa. They've gone from bad to worse to joke and every time it looks as though they are turning the corner, they slide right back to where they started. Except twice. In 2004, when they won the Champions Trophy and in 2006, when they reached the final of the same tournament. #p#Their victims in the semi-final in 2006 were none other than South Africa and, as if by some magic spell, Gayle was it again. The West Indies were chasing a modest 259 and Gayle didn't want to waste time doing it. His 133-ball 133 snatched any sign of a contest away and had Shivanarine Chanderpaul not retired with the score on 194 without loss, the South African bowlers were at real risk of never making a breakthrough. #p#It's become such a habit for West Indies to pull the rug from under South Africa's feet, usually with the help of one centurion, that Richie Richardson, now the West Indies team manager, says it will be no surprise if they do it again. "We have always beaten them, if we do that again it won't be an upset," he said. Still, he has cautioned the team not to rely or even think about the history. "We will not be going into the match thinking, we beat them in the past." #p#Most are with Bravo, saying the team has not even recalled the stories of matches of tournaments past. "We don't discuss South Africa's history in the World Cup and we don't discuss our history in the World Cup," he said. Only Chris Gayle flirted with the idea briefly when he said, "Give and take they are beatable," but he quickly added a condition, "all teams are beatable, we just have to try and be discreet going about our business." Like all teams, the West Indies are not talking the big talk until they've walked at least some of the big walk. #p#If there is one team that can do that with a distinctive swagger, it's them, so don't be surprised if there is a mysterious little spring in the Caribbean step on Thursday when they walk out to kick off their tournament against South Africa.
7	502514	West Indies v South Africa, Group B, World Cup 2011, Delhi	Recent form favours South Africa	Madhusudhan Ramakrishnan	February 23, 2011	Chris Gayle: centuries in all three formats against South Africa AFP Enlarge Related Links Preview : After all the questions, finally South Africa play Players/Officials: Chris Gayle | Dale Steyn Matches: South Africa v West Indies at Delhi Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: South Africa | West Indies Grounds: Feroz Shah Kotla #p#Going by recent form, South Africa are firm favourites going into their first match of the World Cup, against West Indies. South Africa have won 26 of the 39 matches played since the beginning of 2009 and along with Australia, have the best win-loss ratio in the same period. Their only series defeats since 2009 have come against England and India, and their biggest disappointment was the failure to make the semi-finals of the Champions Trophy in 2009. West Indies, on the other hand, have won just 10 matches and lost 27 since the beginning of 2009, and have the worst win-loss ratio among Test-playing teams. Their last series win against a Test-playing team came in the home series against Sri Lanka in 2007-08. However, what makes the match-up interesting is that West Indies have almost always found a way to compete against South Africa in global tournaments, where they have won four out of the eight matches played between the two sides. #p#Head-to-head record South Africa have beaten West Indies in their last eleven meetings since the Champions Trophy in 2006. However, West Indies can draw confidence from their record against South Africa in global tournaments. While Brian Lara's superb centuries in Karachi and Cape Town gave them victories in the 1996 and 2003 World Cup matches, it was Chris Gayle's aggressive 133 which led to a convincing six-wicket win in the Champions Trophy match in Jaipur in 2006. South Africa, though, boosted by AB de Villiers' 146, won comfortably on the last occasion the teams met in the World Cup, in 2007. In the subcontinent, South Africa have a better record, having won four out of six matches played between the two teams. Since 2000, however, West Indies are one of only three teams to boast a positive win-loss record in ODIs in India. #p#West Indies v South Africa in ODIs Played Won Lost Overall 50 12 37 Home 21 5 16 Away/Neutral 29 7 21 Global tournaments 8 4 4 In subcontinent 6 2 4 Since Jan 2008 10 0 10 #p#South Africa's batting dominance Since January 2008, South Africa have a batting average of 37.42, the best among all teams that have played at least 50 matches. In contrast, West Indies average just 25.73. While South African batsmen have made 111 fifty-plus scores in 56 matches, West Indies have just 69 fifty-plus scores in 61 matches. South Africa's record against West Indies is even more impressive; in ten ODIs since the beginning of 2008, they average 42.94 with five centuries. West Indian batsmen, on the other hand, have not scored a single century and average just 25.94. Jacques Kallis, de Villiers and Hashim Amla average over 50 in the last three years in matches against West Indies. Amla especially, has been exceptional scoring over 400 runs in five matches with two centuries and one half-century. Shivnarine Chanderpaul, who averages nearly 44, has been the solitary success for West Indies in recent head-to-head matches against South Africa. Gayle, who is the only player to score a century against South Africa in all three formats, has had a very poor time since 2008. In five matches against South Africa, he has scored just 128 runs without a single half-century. #p#Batting stats in head-to-head matches since 2008 Batsman Team Matches Runs Average Strike rate 100 50 Jacques Kallis South Africa 10 452 56.50 89.32 1 4 AB de Villiers South Africa 10 425 53.12 89.47 1 3 Hashim Amla South Africa 5 402 80.40 101.25 2 1 Shivnarine Chanderpaul West Indies 7 307 43.85 64.49 0 4 Dwayne Bravo West Indies 10 252 25.20 84.28 0 1 Chris Gayle West Indies 5 128 25.60 90.78 0 0 #p#Bowling experience the key Dale Steyn, the best fast bowler in Tests over the last few years, has been less effective in ODIs. He has picked up 58 wickets at an average of nearly 30 since the beginning of 2008. Surprisingly, his record against West Indies is poor: he has just eight wickets in seven matches at an average of 39.25. Morne Morkel has been much more impressive, with 53 wickets at 24.18. He has picked up 18 wickets in his last seven matches against West Indies with two four-wicket hauls. Lonwabo Tsotsobe lends variety to the pace attack, while the consistent Johan Botha has led the spin attack well over the last few years. With legspinner Imran Tahir showing plenty of promise, South Africa's attack has lots of class and variety. #p#In the absence of the injured Jerome Taylor and Fidel Edwards, the West Indian pace attack is led by Kemar Roach and Ravi Rampaul. Dwayne Bravo, the highest wicket-taker for West Indies since 2008, and Darren Sammy complete the pace line-up. Despite the presence of spinners like Sulieman Benn and Nikita Miller, the bowling attack overall lacks the experience and firepower that South Africa possess. #p#First ten and last ten overs South Africa have been the superior batting side, scoring at a higher run-rate and averaging higher than West Indies in the mandatory Powerplay overs and the last ten overs. When the bowling performance is analysed, West Indies have a slightly better economy rate in both the first ten and last ten overs. Overall though, the run-rate difference is significantly better for South Africa. #p#Performance in first ten overs and last ten overs since Jan 2009 Team Overs Runs scored Run rate Wickets lost Batting avg Runs Conceded Economy rate Wickets taken Bowling avg Run rate difference South Africa 1-10 2144 5.49 38 56.42 1835 5.07 51 35.98 0.42 West Indies 1-10 1808 4.77 58 31.17 1876 4.70 44 42.63 0.07 South Africa 41-50 2194 7.85 90 24.37 1960 7.46 103 19.02 0.39 West Indies 41-50 1339 7.31 75 17.85 1664 7.18 78 21.33 0.13 #p#Delhi, the venue for the game, has hosted just five ODIs since 2000. Three of those matches were won by the team batting first, but India won the only day-night game by six wickets against Australia in 2009. The most recent match in Delhi - between India and Sri Lanka in December 2009 - however, ended abruptly as the pitch was deemed dangerous for play to continue. The focus will thus be as much on the pitch as the teams on Thursday.
7	502520	West Indies v South Africa, World Cup 2011, Delhi	'South Africa better prepared than ever' - Kallis	Firdose Moonda in Delhi	February 22, 2011	#p#Jacques Kallis has said South Africa are "better prepared than we have been for any World Cup." It's no different to what any of the other members of the squad have preached in the build-up but coming from the team's premier allrounder's lips, it sounds different. #p#Kallis is, by far, South Africa's most experienced player in the tournament, with this World Cup being his fifth. His analysis has context: that of the being part of the 1996 team that had one bad day in the quarter-finals, the 1999 team that missed on a final spot in dramatic fashion, the 2003 team that didn't make it past the first round of the competition played on home soil and the 2007 team that crumbled to Australia - twice. #p#This time Kallis feels the make-up of the squad is different. "We've covered all our bases," he said. "We have the balance in the team to be able to play on any type of tracks that come in front of us, which is something we really haven't had for a while." #p#The one glaringly undercooked element of South African squads of the past has been the lack of an attacking spinner, something has Kallis has lived through. "The last unorthodox one [spinner] might have been Paul Adams," he said, which is why the inclusion of Pakistan-born legspinner Imran Tahir is exciting so many people, including Kallis. "He creates some doubt in the batsmen's mind and he's fitted in fantastically into the squad." Kallis added that together with pace attack that has "produced the goods recently," South Africa can "adapt to any adapt to any conditions put in front of us." #p#He was mindful not to neglect mentioning, with a glint in his eye, that one of the cogs in that attack is an "old allrounder who bowls a bit." It's refreshing to see the lighter side of Kallis, a testament to the shift in the mindset of the South African squad that both their own and other journalists have noticed. #p#The change in attitude, according to the ageing man himself, can be attributed to the sense of belonging each squad member feels. "Each guy knows his role which is major part of feeling relaxed. You get quite nervous when you're not sure where you fit in. The team has spent a lot of time together now as a unit." #p#With what Kallis sees as a complete line-up he is encouraging the team to revel in the experience. "Guys can go out there and really enjoy it, which is something that as a senior player I've been wanting to get across." After the disappointment of four World Cups, Kallis knows what he's saying when he dispatches the advice to have fun. "The thing with a World Cup is once it starts it goes by in the blink of an eye, so I want to encourage them to enjoy it."
7	502595	South Africa v West Indies, World Cup 2011, Group B, Delhi	'We've covered every base' - Smith	Firdose Moonda in Delhi	February 23, 2011	#p#Graeme Smith is ready to "leave it all out there" when he captains South Africa for the last time in an ODI tournament, starting on Thursday against the West Indies in Delhi. "I feel I am best prepared going into this tournament as I have been throughout my career. I am just excited to be able to lead the guys." #p#So ready is he that he almost left it all out there when a reporter persisted in asking if Smith thought the team would be able to drop the chokers tag, given their record under pressure. When Smith said that there is a "luck element" in tournaments such as this, the journalist went on to ask if South Africa's nerves often undid any luck that the team may have secured. Smith sneered in reply. "So you have been out in the middle, you will understand that?" #p#Silence. #p#No one on the outside can really understand the unique kind of pressure that has weighed South Africa down, or how stoically they've had to deny that it's had any effect on them. Every few years, when questions like the one above get asked, we get a small glimpse into the burden of underachievement South Africa cricketers carry. It's why each tournament, for them, seems bigger and more important than the previous one and why this one is "the biggest tournament" for this group of players to date. #p#"A lot of the guys who are here for the first time have definitely said that," Smith said. "The expectation, the energy around India and before we left, the things that were going on around the group, especially compared to the other World Cups, this is a lot bigger." #p#The heightened importance of this tournament may stem from the fact that South Africa have brought their most dynamic line-up to a major competition, especially in the bowling department. "It's the most variety that we have ever had," Smith said. "We now have pace, we have bounce, we have left-armers, we have got a few spin options." The variation means that South Africa hope they will be "a lot harder to prepare against" because their starting XI is going to be more elastic than it has been in the past. "Tactically we have got our ideas about how we would like to set up in this tournament. We have covered every base there and we are really excited to get going." #p#South Africa have been training in India for just over two weeks and although that time has allowed the squad to settle in, there is still an element of uncertainty going into their first game in the World Cup. The Feroz Shah Kotla stadium is hosting its first match after a 14-month ban it incurred in December 2009 for having a dangerous pitch. It has been since relaid, with a surface that promises even bounce, but Smith said neither side knows what to expect from it. "It's an unknown factor for all of us. But I think you can see they have made a really big effort out here." #p#It's also the first time Smith will use the Umpire Decision Review System in a one-day international and it may prove tricky when the team is in the field because "with our bowlers, every decision is out," Smith said. "I'll have to trust AB also because I am not always going to be in a position to really judge the lines and where the ball has pitched." #p#What's not a first is coming up against the West Indies in the opening match of a World Cup. The last time that happened, South Africa were put to the sword by a blustering innings from Chris Gayle. Smith is wary of not allowing the same kind of flamboyant performance to undo South Africa again. "They have guys who on their day can really punish you and take the game away from you. That's why in Cup competitions, they are a very dangerous opponent to come up against." #p#The West Indies struggle with consistency, as Smith noted, and often fall away in a four- or five-match series, but playing them in a one-off match is as much a competition as playing anyone else. Their strategy is based on a certain casual yet colourful flair. In many ways, on their day, they are side that leaves it all there. To see them come against a South African captain who hopes to do the same promises an explosion.
7	502623	South Africa v West Indies, World Cup 2011, Delhi	Kotla's acid test	Sharda Ugra in Delhi	February 23, 2011	The DDCA will be hoping that there will no repeat of such scenes during Thursday's World Cup game between South Africa and West Indies AFP Enlarge Related Links Matches: South Africa v West Indies at Delhi Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: India | South Africa | West Indies Grounds: Feroz Shah Kotla #p#When West Indies meets South Africa at the Feroz Shah Kotla on Thursday, it won't merely be Graeme Smith and Darren Sammy's men who will be tested. The Feroz Shah Kotla itself is on trial. The first World Cup match between two non-hosting frontline teams is Kotla's first international match after the India-Sri Lanka ODI was abandoned on December 29, 2009. #p#For a cricket ground that nestles close to the oldest medieval parts of India's extremely status-conscious capital, Thursday will about more than just cricket. It will be about Kotla saving face; restoring not merely pride, but that very Delhi essential, appearance. #p#At the moment though, all is looking good. For the last six years since the Kotla's makeover, usually every inch of the frontage of the large, unnamed North Stand at its Delhi Gate end is usually festooned with advertising hoardings whose intentions are not merely to sell products, but also to hurt the human eye. On the eve of its first World Cup game, though, all the stands actually appear almost dignified, covered by the ICC's uniform signage, making the architect's unspoilt image, somewhat visible. #p#Yet tomorrow, neither signage nor stands will matter. They are but the window dressing to what will actually count: what happens on its wicket. The Kotla track has spent a good portion of its life being a paata , the Indian cricketing colloquialism for a flat track, before it morphed into a pit viper as 2009 drew to an end. Abandoned and deemed dangerous by international cricket, the team in charge of the Kotla wicket will spend Wednesday night hoping that they have shape-shifted the serpent into a batting-friendly lamb. #p#West Indian Dwayne Bravo left all that in the hands of the ICC saying that had the ground had not been fit to stage an ODI, the governing body wouldn't have approved it. South Africa captain Graeme Smith was a bit more cautious, calling the wicket an "unknown factor" before Thursday's game. There is a good chance that the anxious officials of the Delhi & District Cricket Association (DDCA) think of it in the same manner. #p#The last game staged at the Kotla was four months ago, when Delhi hosted two Ranji Trophy matches against Bengal and Gujarat in November to test out the wicket laid out after the December 2009 disaster. Scores at the Kotla from that November read: 473, 459, 92 for 3 followed by 71, 437 and 289. The World Cup match will be played not on the "abandoned" patch of land but on the same wicket that staged the Delhi v Bengal game. #p#After the match with Gujarat, Delhi moved all its home games to its other ground at the Roshanara Club, which is what they turn to when "outrights" (victories that carry five points) are needed. The Kotla is the ground where the home team turns up to give its batsmen enough time in the middle. The DDCA officials maintain that once the ICC's pitch advisor Andy Atkinson had approved the wicket and asked them to give it some 'rest' to let the grass grow, they decided to put it into its winter hibernation. #p#Nothing would make the DDCA's officials happier than if the Kotla awakes on Thursday with the paata back in its soul with plenty of runs for the taking. The DDCA's much-maligned officials want their fortress to stand up for their reputations and not become the cricket World Cup's second disaster zone, following Eden Gardens. Which is probably why there were two policemen wielding rifles found standing around the pitch all day as organisers practiced their pre- and post-match ceremonies and tried out the sound system. (A marvellously powerful rendition of Nkosi Sikele Africa left the South African journalists working in the press box undecided over what was to be shown more respect - their anthem or their deadline.) #p#The unmistakeable figure of Atkinson wandered over to the pitch at regular intervals and even made for a great photo op as he sat on one of Kotla's light rollers. Match referee Jeff Crowe began his perambulation of the ground as everyone fussed over the wicket: men with guns, Atkinson, ICC officials testing the firmness of its mid-section, groundsmen. Maybe the Kotla will surprise us all tomorrow - neither paata nor pit viper, but just the ideal venue for an entertaining 100 overs.
7	502626	South Africa v West Indies, World Cup 2011, Group B, Delhi	After all the questions, finally South Africa play	The Preview by Firdose Moonda	February 23, 2011	#p#Match facts February 24, Delhi Start time 14:30 local time (09:00 GMT) #p#The specks of green on the Kotla pitch may help Lonwabo Tsotsobe. Enlarge Related Links Features : Recent form favours South Africa Matches: South Africa v West Indies at Delhi Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: South Africa | West Indies #p#Big Picture It's been exactly a month since South Africa last played an ODI and almost every minute of the days spent between their victory over India in Centurion and this moment has been consumed with how they will approach the World Cup. Questions have floated in the air about every possible aspect of South Africa's squad and strategy. Even after they have been answered, they've managed to find a mouth-to-mouth way of being resuscitated and asked again, in a slightly different way. #p#How many spinners will they play? Will the middle order prove strong enough? Can the quicks do the job in the subcontinent? How much is expected of a squad with 11 World Cup debutants? Will they choke again? #p#After all that, it's no wonder that South Africa are itching to get onto the field as soon as possible so that the cricket can start and the questions can end, or at least change. Even though South Africa have talked down the pressure, the truth is it has gone nowhere. After five failed attempts to raise the World Cup with five squads more than capable of raising it, patience is running out. The match against the West Indies on Thursday is not so much about the opposition as it is about starting the campaign with the kind of intent that will tell their critics and fans how serious they are about doing the business this time. #p#For West Indies, it's pressure of a completely different kind. They have slipped below Bangladesh in the ODI rankings to ninth spot and this World Cup presents them with an opportunity to show that they can still be counted among the top nations in international cricket. They've had difficult series in the recent past, against Sri Lanka and South Africa, and give the impression of a side that may fire now and again but struggles to find consistency in prolonged series. #p#They're aiming for the quarter-finals and the format could well see them get there, but they will have to achieve at least three "onces" to achieve that. In personnel they have the capability, so it's the mindset they'll have to get right. Their match against South Africa is being touted as the first marquee one of the tournament, although England against the Netherlands rubbished that assumption. To make an impact in this one could serve them well in the coming weeks. #p#Form guide (Most recent first for the last five completed games): South Africa: WWLLW West Indies: LLLLL #p#Pitch and Conditions The Kotla has not hosted an international since December 2009 when a dangerous pitch forced the ODI between India and Sri Lanka to be abandoned after 23 overs. It has since been re-laid under the supervision of the BCCI ground and wickets committee chairman Venkat Sundaram and ICC pitch consultant Andy Atkinson, who have said it will provide an even contest between bat and ball. There was a hint of green on the surface which could favour seam and bounce. The outfield is lush but with Delhi's warm, clear afternoons and chilly nights, dew is likely to be a factor here. #p#Watch out for The last 12 months in one-day cricket have been raining runs for Hashim Amla. He has scored 1308 runs in 20 matches at an average of 72.66, but beyond the numbers his style with the bat has done the talking. Amla has gone from being a careful customer to a flamboyant flasher and has been seen going wild in the first ten overs of an innings. When he gets it right, which is most of the time, a big score is one the cards. #p#Darren Bravo has been talked up as the next Brian Lara. The younger Bravo has only played 13 matches with a top score of 74 against Canada. He also gave a respectable enough account of himself against South Africa in May last year and if ever there was a stage big enough to show he can fill Lara's boots, this is it. #p#Team news South Africa's big conundrum is how many spinners they should use. On a track that shows specks of green, they may feel justified in playing their three-pronged seam attack and two frontline spinners. Given the trust they have shown in Johan Botha and the form of Robin Peterson, it's likely that Imran Tahir will have to wait a little longer to make his international debut. #p#South Africa (probable): 1 Graeme Smith, 2 Hashim Amla, 3 Jacques Kallis, 4 AB de Villiers, 5 JP Duminy, 6 Faf du Plessis, 7 Robin Peterson, 8 Johan Botha, 9 Morne Morkel, 10 Dale Steyn, 11 Lonwabo Tsotsobe #p#West Indies are likely to go with only one spinner and it will probably be Sulieman Benn which means Nikita Miller will be sitting on the bench. Their pace attack will be led by Ravi Rampaul and Kemar Roach. #p#West Indies (probable): 1 Chris Gayle, 2 Devon Smith, 3 Darren Bravo, 4 Ramnaresh Sarwan, 5 Shivnarine Chanderpaul, 6 Dwayne Bravo, 7 Kieron Pollard, 8 Darren Sammy, 9 Ravi Rampaul, 10 Kemar Roach, 11 Sulieman Benn #p#Stats and Trivia #p#South Africa have beaten the West Indies in the last 11 ODIs the two sides have contested. That includes a match in the 2007 World Cup and a series both at home and in the Caribbean. The last time West Indies registered a win against South Africa was in 2006 in the Champions Trophy semi-final. #p#West Indies have never lost a match at the Kotla. Of the seven matches they've played at the venue, only one was a one-dayer in 1989, where they beat India. South Africa have not played an ODI at the Kotla. #p#The highest score and the lowest score at this ground both came in the same match. Pakistan scored 303 for 8 and bowled India out for 144. #p#Kieron Pollard has not been dismissed in single figures against South Africa, although he only averages 24.00 against them. #p#Quotes "Consistency-wise, they haven't been as good as the other teams over a lengthy period of time but they have match-winners and that's why playing them in a one-off game makes them very dangerous." Graeme Smith on why the West Indies can be a bogey team in a major tournament. #p#"We want to just see West Indies go out and play like we used to do in the eighties. As long as we go and give our best the fans will be happy." Darren Sammy on his team wanting to get back that old Caribbean magic.
7	502643	West Indies v South Africa, World Cup 2011, Delhi	Sammy urges 'belief' from his team	Sharda Ugra in Delhi	February 23, 2011	#p#All that is heard on the day of a big match are soundbites meant to fling challenges at the opposition and all that is seen is the strutting-around of the obviously confident. When the West Indians went into their nets at the Ferozshah Kotla practice area, they went down another route. #p#They gathered around in a circle, listening to their coach Otis Gibson speak. Some had arms around a team-mate's shoulder and even the imperious Chris Gayle looking deferential. After a while the circle drew closer and the heads were bowed, the voices quieter. It was as if the men in maroon had gathered together in prayer. The West Indies may be confident, given a chance one or two of them would love to provoke their opposition but what they tried to gathered together today in that circle of comrades, was something more elemental: belief. #p#It is the one word that crops up in all their conversations leading up to their first World Cup match where, like the Bangladeshis who now precede them in the ICC's ODI rankings, they are up against a far stronger adversary. #p#South Africa are favourites here, not just because they have beaten them 11 times in a row, with two consecutive 5-0 thrashings at home and away. The last time the West Indians defeated South Africa was also the last time the two teams met in India, in the semi-finals of the 2006 Champions Trophy in Jaipur. Four of the top six West Indian batsmen who chased down 258 that night will still find their way into the line-up tomorrow. It was the last ICC event played in India and the West Indies made the final. #p#It is why the West Indians must have belief; in terms of sheer providence, they are back in the same country where they last made a World Cup semi-final and the last ICC event final. In terms of the cricket, if this is to be a batsman's World Cup, the West Indies are as well stacked in that department as any of the other teams who are thought of as the events leading contenders. #p#What the West Indies seek, as captain Darren Sammy said at his pre-match media session, was not the flamboyance of their batting stars but the unit's overall consistency. If their batsmen can churn out a chunkful of runs, as opposed to breathtaking cameos, it will give their fairly unregarded bowling attack something to go at. As the light of a Delhi spring faded by 6pm, the team came onto the centre of the Kotla ground and had a brief bowling run-in on the wicket two strips away from the one for tomorrow's match. The medium pacers were managing to hit something just below the keeper's knee roll and only the quicker men, like the deceptively small, wiry Roach, were able to land the ball into the keeper's gloves near shoulder-height. #p#Spin is going to be every team's calling card at this tournament and it is here that the West Indies find themselves without the range that is available to their opponents tomorrow. With two left-arm spinners in Sulieman Benn and the raw Nikita Miller, Gayle's off-spin that will have to go from part-time to full throttle. To succeed, the West Indian medium pacers would do well to borrow what Sammy calls the information available to them from Dwayne Bravo's IPL experiences, Gibson's bowling nous as well as the ODI record of non-Asian bowlers in India. #p#Two of their own, Winston Benjamin (36 wickets at 33.5 from 23 ODIs) and Courtney Walsh (35 wickets at 28.5 in 32 ODIs), lead the pack in terms of wickets. The most impressive of the non-Asians happens to be Australian left-armer Nathan Bracken (33 wickets at 20.96 in 18 ODIs) and Allan Donald (28 wickets at 19.47 in 15 ODIs), who is now signed up as bowling coach with New Zealand. #p#The South Africans have been shown due respect to them being an all-round, thorough, completely professional team with small reminders from two of the West Indies' leading men. Dwayne Bravo said yesterday: "They have a bad history as far as the World Cup is concerned but they are a very good team and you can't take that away from them." #p#On his weekend ruminations, Gayle said the West Indies will have to: "Be on their A-game against the South Africans and once we get a sniff in, we try to capitalise on it as much as possible." He paused and went on: "Give and take, they are beatable, all teams are beatable, we just have to try and be discreet going about our business." The West Indians have been so discreet that no one is giving them a chance. Sammy's reminded everyone dreaming of an upset that, "Cricket is played on the day. It does not matter whether you are No. 1 or No. 9 [in the world], you still have to go out there and do what you have to do, in order to come out victorious." #p#There could be no better time or place for the West Indies to put their annus horribilis behind them than at the Ferozshah Kotla, named after an medieval fortress that is now in ruins. The team has been in touch with the men who built the Caribbean cricketing citadel. Sammy said he had got messages from the man he called "Sir Viv" and had spent time chatting to Clive Lloyd. Amidst the talk of a fraying legacy and a shrinking demographic, Sammy offered a different, wider vision. He spoke of the pressures of being the only St Lucian in the team and why handling the captaincy was one of the privileges of the job. Cricket, he reminded everyone, "is the one uniting force for the Caribbean people" He said all the fans wanted was to wake up early on Thursday morning, and seeing "that fight, that passion we had back in the 80s. We have to go out and execute properly - so that the fans who would be waking up early in the morning could be happy with our performances"

In 39 matches since the beginning of 2009, de Villiers has scored 1947 runs at an average of 62.80 and strike rate of 97.88 with seven centuries and 11 fifties. <m32>The 119-run partnership between Graeme Smith and de Villiers</m32> is the second highest for the third wicket for South Africa in World Cup matches behind the 145-run stand between Daryll Cullinan and Gary Kirsten against UAE in 1996. <m33>Imran Tahir's spell of 4 for 41</m33> is the third-best by a bowler making his ODI debut in a World Cup game. The best bowling performance belongs to Canada's Austin Codrington who picked up 5 for 27 against Kenya in 2003. #p#The thoroughness of South Africa's gameplans and their willingness to utilise unorthodox tactics was in evidence first in their decision to include no less than three frontline spinners in Johan Botha, Tahir and Robin Peterson and then when, for the first time in his career, <m34>Botha opened the bowling</m34> and soon <m35>snared Gayle with an edge to slip</m35>. #p#<m36>Bravo set the early tone with a couple of deftly glanced boundaries off Steyn</m36> and brought up <m37>a 55-ball 50 in the 16th over</m37>, his third in ODIs, and celebrating the milestone with <m38>a remarkable one-handed smite over long-on off Tahir</m38>. <m39>The century stand was brought up off 117 deliveries in the 20th over</m39>, and with West Indies starting to seize the initiative Smith turned to Botha. #p#<m40>Again the offspinner provided the breakthrough, slipping one past an uncertain flick to pin Bravo in front of middle and dismiss him for 73 despite a slightly desperate referral from the batsman</m40>. <m41>Tahir then took centre stage, holding a a simple caught-and-bowled chance off Smith</m41> for his first international wicket and <m42>removing Ramnaresh Sarwan before he had time to settle</m42> #p#Just as the elder Bravo and Chanderpaul were starting to flow a brainless piece of running put paid to their fightback. <m43>A reverse-sweep from Chanderpaul went straight to the man at short third man but inexplicably a run was called for and Bravo was easily run out for 40</m43>, <m44>the score 178 for 5 in the 38th over</m44>. #p#West Indies unravelled with alarming speed thereafter, their innings sliding swiftly into mediocrity after <m45>Chanderpaul, who had upped the tempo with a couple of thumping strikes, chipped Tahir straight to Peterson at long-off</m45>. <m46>Kieron Pollard's arrival at the crease caused an immediate ripple of excitement among a decent crowd of spectators</m46>, but <m47>Steyn returned to dismiss him for a golden duck with a skidding inswinger that struck the pad in front of middle and leg</m47>. <m48>Tahir had his fourth wicket when a wild swipe from wicketkeeper Devon Thomas ended up in JP Duminy's hands, running back from extra cover</m48>, and the tail proved no match for Steyn's pace and accuracy as the innings was wrapped up soon afterwards. #p#Match Timeline

AFP Enlarge Related Links Matches: South Africa v West Indies at Delhi Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: South Africa | West Indies #p#The anthem Halfway through the South African national anthem, one line before it was about to change from Sotho to Afrikaans, instead of the name of the country being belted out in high-pitched melody, it stopped. Instead of that throwing the team off, they carried on singing, helped by a section of touring fans. The group had walked in with South African flags draped over their clothes and had no problems helping the fifteen men on the field sing the anthem to completion. The ICC apologised to the team and said it will use a better quality version of the anthem in future matches. #p#The optical illusion. It was the only one in the West Indian innings, early on in the contest, just after it had been proved that the Kotla was back to its low, somnolent, unban-able business. <m1>Morne Morkel, in his second over, bowling round the wicket made full use of his height to find wherever shred of bounce there may have been in the wicket. The ball leapt off the ground and at Darren Bravo's nose like a drone in a bad mood. Bravo got his wrists out of the way, turned his body convex and lived to see many moments more.</m1> For the next three hours, it was normal service again. #p#The alarm-clock moment. After more than 11 overs of West Indies batsmen scratching around and being (pardon the word) choked mid-innings by the South African spin trio of Botha, Tahir and Peterson, Dwayne Bravo decided enough was enough. <m2>Botha tossed one up, Bravo Sr leapt at it, swinging angry, clean and over midwicket for six.</m2> A journalist in the press box spontaneously hollered, "Jamnapaar!", which translates into 'Across the Jamna!" The Jamuna/Jamna/ Yamuna being the river that splits Delhi's posh southwest from its eastern edges. In baseball they would call that a lusty home run. The Bravo 'fireworks' promised by Gayle had been lit. #p#The celebrations. Imran Tahir dispelled any doubts about his patriotism to South Africa when he emphatically kissed the Protea badge on his jersey after taking <m3>his first wicket in international cricket</m3>. Tahir's joy knew no bounds, and with each of the subsequent wickets he claimed, his victory dance gained another step. From a mad dash into a circle of fielders to pumping his arms as though in a gym and screaming his lungs out, Tahir was enjoying every moment on the international stage. #p#<m4>Kemar Roach competed with Tahir for the most animated celebration when he dismissed Hashim Amla in the second over he bowled</m4>. <m5>After Amla was caught at slip</m5>, Roach ran wildly away from his team-mates, an excited pack of fielders in pursuit, and charged at the dressing room. He pulled on his shirt and thumped the logo so hard his heart must have jumped in his rib cage. #p#The aggravation. The West Indies have a way of getting under South Africa's skin and they did it again today. <m6>When Graeme Smith gestured for spectators to move away from the sight screen and refused to take his guard until they did so, Chris Gayle was impatient for play to resume. He kept mockingly approaching the crease, as though he was about to bowl, and then lobbed the ball over to Devon Thomas behind the stumps. Thomas removed the bails and, for a laugh, appealed. Smith was, predictably, unimpressed.</m6>
7	502838	South Africa v West Indies, Group B, World Cup 2011, Delhi	Police cause food shortage at Kotla	Firdose Moonda at the Feroz Shah Kotla	February 24, 2011	Fans had to endure scarce and limited food options during the game. AFP Enlarge Related Links Matches: South Africa v West Indies at Delhi Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup #p#A food prevention exercise by the Delhi police resulted in a severe food shortage at the Feroz Shah Kotla during the match between West Indies and South Africa. Until the late stages of the match, more than 150 service people, spectators, and media were without food due to the police crackdown. There was even the danger of the South African team going into the game without lunch. #p#"We arrived at 12.30 and made arrangements for lunch to arrive then but it only arrived at 13.10 because of the security and police," Mohammed Moosajee, the South African team manager, told ESPNCricinfo. West Indies, however, arrived a little after 13.00 and found their food was on time, some of them having eaten at the hotel. South Africa's 40-minute wait, though, was much shorter than the hours other people had to endure before being allowed to eat. #p#Trucks carrying food packs for all the service staff in the stadium, including ball boys and ushers, were turned away at the gates. Police denied them entry, effectively allowing all the food they had brought with them to go to waste. "Our vehicles were all accredited, but only two of them came in and one was turned back," one of the catering managers at the venue said. "We were not allowed to bring anything in. The food was all cooked, but it all spoiled." #p#Someone else who was at risk of having his prepared food go bad was television commentator and former England opener Geoffrey Boycott, who had brought his own meal with him. He had suffered from throat cancer and caters for his specific eating needs. "I don't eat curries, which is what they normally give you. So I bring sandwiches. Anything which is spicy just burns," he said. Police wanted him to leave the sandwiches outside but Boycott wouldn't budge. "I said, 'I want to speak to the general or the brigadier, whoever's in charge, 'cause I'm taking my bloody sandwiches in'." An official came to Boycott's rescue and ensured he was able to take his sandwiches with him. #p#Fans did not go completely hungry but the usual selection of food, ranging from Indian snacks, patties, samosas, was nowhere to be found, not even in the expensive pavilion stand where tickets were close to Rs 4600. Only sponsor's soft drinks and potato chips stalls were allowed inside the stadium. Other vendors were not allowed into the venue, something that can only be achieved as a result of weeks of planning, as is done at the IPL. #p#An administrator with the IPL team, the Delhi Daredevils, who play their matches at the Kotla, said the franchise sets up a fully functional office at the stadium six weeks before the tournament starts. It is that office which the ICC has operated out of in the run-up to the event. They meet with the police once a week in order to brief them on what food is coming through and when to expect it. With the ICC not going into such intricate details with the security forces, they have not been able to ensure the same kind of cooperation. #p#The food scarcity was one of several issues that the media faced. Accredited tickets did not work at the security scanners, everything from the wi-fi to the coffee machine collapsed for a few hours, and the meals for the photographers went the same way as the food for the service people. Fresh packs had to be prepared and sent to the stadium, and were eventually let in close to the end of play. Reporters who had been through matches in Dhaka, Ahmedabad and Delhi gave the Kotla the thumbs down - in overall organisation, not merely in matters pertaining to food.
7	502856	South Africa v West Indies, Group B, World Cup 2011, Delhi	South Africa break away from tradition	Firdose Moonda at the Feroz Shah Kotla	February 24, 2011	#p#From the moment the South African national anthem stopped halfway, and the players and some South African fans stood firm in singing it to its conclusion, there was a sense that there was something different about this match. A few minutes later, it presented itself in the form of Johan Botha, standing at the top of his run up, ready to open the bowling. #p#Who were these people and what had they done with the South African cricket team? For a second, Dale Steyn had been approaching to do what he usually does, but he soon realised this was no ordinary day. #p#<m1>A pitch that looked relatively placid provided Botha with sharp turn for the third ball he bowled. While Chris Gayle was walking back, Graeme Smith's Zimbabwean strategy of opening the bowling with spin was justified.</m1> "I'd been thinking about it through the week. They've got two left-handers upfront and I asked Johan to practice a bit in the nets," Smith said after South Africa's victory. "Sometimes when you come up with things and it works out it's a great thing, and today was one of those days." #p#Smith, who was battling a case of the sniffles, can be forgiven for forgetting the next 20 overs didn't work out for any of the South Africans bowlers. <m2>Steyn's first over was worth 11 runs</m2>, <m3>Jacques Kallis bowled two overs that went for 10 and nine</m3>, and <m4>Imran Tahir's second over was 11</m4> as well. Darren Bravo threatened to honour the tradition of a West Indian batsman scoring a century against South Africa to cause an upset and they were settling down as comfortably as content cats on a cuddle cushion in the sun. #p#Then came the drinks break. West Indies used it to relax and South Africa to strategise. They came back in a miserly mood. <m5>The next six overs had 27 runs scored off them</m5> and then <m6>Bravo was out lbw to Botha</m6>. Smith had been using Robin Peterson from the other end but when one wicket fell, he sensed that it was time to unleash the mystery man. It was a decision laced with risk, a decision that the South Africa of before may not even have considered. This South Africa was willing to chance it. #p#Tahir came back with the confidence of a man who had spent years bowling at this level and <m7>took two wickets in two overs</m7>, which could have easily been three <m8>had he held on to the second return chance that went his way</m8>. Tahir showed why his debut was more anticipated than start of the tournament itself by most South Africans, disguising the googly craftily and showing no fear in tossing it up, getting hit a bit and then reaping the rewards. #p#"We tried to use him in short spells and he responded superbly. Every time he came on he made an impact. The guys bowled really well around him and helped to create pressure," Smith said. <m9>Tahir bowled an initial spell of two overs</m9> and <m10>two more spells of four overs each</m10>, the wicket-taking spells. He had Peterson and Botha keeping him company at the other end, with Peterson a silent, yet vital, partner along the way. #p#Peterson had taken the most wickets of any of the South African bowlers in the warm up games and was emerging as an unlikely striker, the Nemanja Vidic of the team. Smith singled him out for praise saying that he "bowled really well" even though he was wicketless and helped control the mid section of the game with Botha. #p#The presence of three spinners even rubbed off on <m11>Steyn, who ran through the West Indies tail with the clinical approach of a surgeon.</m11> With the wicket-taking responsibility evenly spread, Steyn could save himself for when he was needed and, as a result, "bowled quicker" at times. He was able to play a slightly different, but equally effective role. #p#Traditionalists would not have recognised this South African attack and, although they may be pleased with its results, they'll be happy to hear that normal service has not disappeared from Smith's mind completely. He said that the slew of spinners was not a strategy, but a result of circumstance. "It worked for us today and we will reassess going into the next game." He also didn't rule out the possibility of Lonwabo Tsotsobe, who had success against India and Pakistan, returning, saying that he will "play a very big part in this World Cup." #p#South Africa have eight days to think about what to do in their next match, against Netherlands in Mohali. Until then, they can bask in the knowledge that their captain is living up to his promise of being dynamic and affording them the luxury of variation, and that he is enjoying the unpredictability. "Everything that I envisaged going into this game seemed to work out," Smith said. "I just trusted my gut feel."

Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: Dwayne Bravo | Darren Bravo Matches: South Africa v West Indies at Delhi Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: West Indies #p#It could have been the stirring tale of the Brothers Bravo, but what followed the glimmering light of a few hours of West Indian batting turned into a growing, somewhat familiar gloom. The first 90 minutes of West Indies' World Cup began with all the promise of the team having turned a corner after 18 miserable months. By the end of the game, South Africa may well have believed they produced proof that their opponents were merely going around in circles. #p#To see the West Indian batting, their far stronger suit, go into meltdown at the Feroz Shah Kotla, was to be at the heart of the team's story. Every flaw that dogged them in the recent past was on show. Every reason why they lost games they could have won was played out yet again. Those 12 straight defeats to South Africa could make men of all manner numb. #p#They had their chances; the first half of the game was littered with them. West Indies had wanted to bat anyway. <m1>A century partnership for the second wicket</m1> meant they could absorb a blow to their solar plexus, <m2>Chris Gayle's third-ball dismissal</m2>. A mid-innings strangle by the South African spin allsorts left their two most experienced batsmen together with half the innings to play. When the last 15 overs were nearing, the man they call Mr Fireworks had found his turbo gear. As the anxiety grew, West Indies still had their biggest hitter waiting. Opportunities were being set up over and over again. And yet and yet  #p#But first, the glimmering light. The game today marked the unveiling of a beauteous left-hander to an international audience. He is said to be a clone of the great West Indian entertainer, and match-winner, who left this team four years ago. But clone is too derogatory a word, used for something created in a laboratory from a test tube. Not for a batsman who reminds us why we watch the game, and how, if we can distance ourseslves from the grim business of victories and defeats, cricket becomes unadulterated enjoyment. On a grey, grim Kotla day, dotted with empty seats and outbreaks of occasional noise, Darren Bravo decided to be radiance on two legs. #p#If there is anything about Darren Bravo that is reminiscent of Brian Lara, it is his instinctive urge to create a gorgeous shot. If not with the massive back-lift of his first cousin, certainly with the signature flourish of the follow-through. <m3>Bravo Jr came into the game</m3> when there was enough reason for him to be circumspect: <m4>2 for 1 with Gayle gone</m4>. <m5>He survived a referral at the end of the Johan Botha over</m5>, and by the time Dale Steyn pounded in with metaphorical smoke emanating from his boots Darren Bravo needed very little time. Or rather, he seemed to have a lot of it. #p#<m6>Bravo flicked Steyn to square leg with the style of a cavalier</m6> whipping some fluff off his hip, then <m7>discarded Kallis' medium pace with minimal regard over the infield, past fielders leaping like salmon</m7>. He then had enough time to sit back, contemplate and choose the most contemptuous option - a swivel pull off a short ball. <m8>Eighteen off 11 balls from Kallis</m8> was enough to send a message about what the cavalryman made of South Africa's general. <m9>A one-handed six off Imran Tahir didn't end up the way it should have</m9>, in the context of the match, but it will make many at the Kotla today grin for months. Devon Smith was happy to be Bravo Jr's shadow, quick with the singles, generous with the running, eager to keep centre stage clean and polished. #p#Over on their dressing-room square of the wicket, the West Indians must have been pleased with the pace of the innings and the notion that their brightest star was about to shoot over the next stage of his career. That was where the South Africans pulled out their Orientalist avatar, one spinner after another. Botha to turn it, Petersen to restrain it and Tahir to leap in and steal a few in flight. It began with <m10>Botha getting Bravo</m10>, who played for some turn and then dolefully called for a review, trapped between hoping and sulking. Once he was gone, the shadow almost predictably followed in his shadow: <m11>Smith out to a return catch and wild celebrations from Tahir</m11>. <m12>Three wickets fell for seven runs</m12> but still there was Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Dwayne Bravo, Kieron Pollard and Darren Sammy, the captain, waiting. #p#The waste of that platform was a sign that if the younger man had been unable to convert a start into something more substantial, then the older men were unable to switch on in time. Dwayne Bravo's innings was the alter ego to his half-brother's in style. His purpose was determined and <m13>his sixes</m13> were tailored for the handsome 10,000 crowd gathered on a working day. <m14>Forty off a partnership of 58</m14> even despite grappling with spin, meant that he knew just where and how he was going. Sadly Chanderpaul didn't. <m15>Bravo's clumsy run-out</m15>, however, was the first of many more errors. <m16>Chanderpaul was just hitting his ODI stride</m16> before <m17>he tried a drive in the sky too many</m17>. <m18>Pollard took too long to arrive and was gone too soon</m18>. <m19>The Powerplay was wasted</m19>, <m20>the last four wickets fell for 13 runs only</m20> and 222 was as shambolic as it looked. South Africa had bowled as well as they could have, with their three spinners on show, but the West Indian batsmen did not compete as fiercely as they should have. #p#Bravo Jr has seen the world's spotlight from a very close distance today and understood that the gap between appearance and impact is the mere matter of fifty runs more here or there. Or an extra half hour played or not. It is easy to calculate in hindsight but very hard to do in real time. Bravo Sr, his knee wrenched during one of his bustling bowling spells and a scan due tomorrow, must lament at where he and his team find themselves in this World Cup.
7	502995	South Africa v West Indies, World Cup 2011, Delhi	Sammy laments not converting starts	ESPNcricinfo staff	February 25, 2011	#p#Before West Indies' opening World Cup match against South Africa, Darren Sammy had said he wanted the cricket community of the Caribbean to wake up on Thursday morning and discover that their team had broken open the World Cup with a performance to remember. After the game at the Kotla on Thursday night, what they would see and read though, was a scorecard that reflected one more game had slipped away from his team's dangerously careless grasp. #p#<m1>A seven-wicket defeat to South Africa</m1> could have been expected, for Graeme Smith's gamblers had sent warning shots across the subcontinent after their performance on Thursday night, but Sammy spoke of how West Indies threw it all away. "We had guys getting starts and none of us carried on. That's where we lost out," he said. "<m2>At 41 overs, we were 201 </m2>and our allrounders were still there. We had [Kieron] Pollard, [Dwayne] Bravo and myself... we could have got to 270." #p#Sammy admitted that getting to 222 was actually a bonus, "given that myself, Chris [Gayle] and Pollard didn't do what we were supposed to. If any of us would have done something..." he said and trailed off. The possibility of people like Gayle and Pollard performing to their optimum is probably what Sammy hopes will keep keep the Caribbean fans waking up on cricket mornings with some optimism. #p#The Delhi wicket has always made stern demands on bowlers and West Indies had, Sammy said, already decided to bat first. "Before the match everyone was uncertain as to how the pitch would play but looking at it, we should have scored 270-plus on the wicket." West Indies, he said, could only have made a match of Thursday's game had they got into South Africa's middle order. "From what we had seen in their series against India, we didn't think their middle order looked too strong, they have quite a few young players." He said that while opportunities had been created, "<m3>AB [de Villiers] batted like a senior</m3> and took South Africa home." #p#<m4>There were four referrals in the West Indies innings</m4>, and barring <m5>one that went in favour of Darren Bravo in the opening over of the match</m5>, South Africa were at the winning end of all. Sammy, who managed to retain his humour at the end of what must have been a tough evening, stepped aside from stirring up trouble when asked about the UDRS Lite in operation at the World Cup without both Snicko and Hot Spot, though he did hint that there were some decisions he was not sure of even after the referrals. "I think it's a good addition to the World Cup. Less mistakes are likely to be made," he said and went on, with a laugh, "The decisions that were made [in the match] clearly showed us the ball was hitting the stumps" The laugh however was as good as him, saying the word, "Not" in his head. Sammy ended the debate with, "So there is nothing much I can say about that, it was just Hawk Eye for us." #p#There would have been much debate about whether West Indies could have played an extra specialist spinner in their left-armer Nikita Miller to give Sulieman Benn some company and the team another slow bowling option, for they are with the current combination far too dependent on the part-time spin of Gayle. Miller could have been included in the team had Darren Bravo been asked to keep wickets instead of Devon Smith, who replaced the injured Carlton Baugh in the squad. Sammy would have none of it, "The guys who are picked in the XI to bowl are capable of doing the job but you have to be consistent to exert the pressure... I don't think we misread the pitch." He was asked whether he missed Miller and said that hypothetically, "who knows what he could have," before adding, "after I lost [Dwayne] Bravo, I surely did miss him." #p#Dwayne Bravo's injury and West Indies' defeat may have distracted attention from the Darren Bravo innings, but Sammy's assessment of his No. 3's 73 was measured. At the start he said, "Darren is a very confident young player, most people compare him to Brian [Lara]. He really looks like Brian. He is a good asset for us. From the time he has made his debut he has batted well for us and I hope he continues." When asked about Darren Bravo's progress in his brief international career, Sammy said, "He played really well in Sri Lanka; all I would say is that when he gets to fifty, he must try to convert it to a hundred, which I am sure he will do." #p#West Indies' next match is against Netherlands in Delhi on February 28.
7	503012	South Africa v West Indies, World Cup 2011, Delhi	de Villiers can play both roles	Firdose Moonda in Delhi	February 25, 2011	AB de Villiers drove South Africa's chase. AFP Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: AB de Villiers Matches: South Africa v West Indies at Delhi Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: South Africa #p#South Africa's bowlers emerged as the men who made it all happen in their World Cup opener against West Indies. The spinners were lauded, first for strangling the life out of the gasping West Indies and then plucking them one by one. Make it happen, they did, but make it all happen, they did not. #p#Four overs into the South African chase, someone else came out and made the rest happen. <m1>AB de Villiers walked to the crease with his team teetering on 20 for 2</m1>, with Sulieman Benn doing a similar job to the one Johan Botha did upfront, and with the knowledge that if another wicket went down it would give West Indies' bowlers a sniff of the inexperienced middle order and it may all go down in flames for South Africa. #p#He waited an over before facing a ball and when he did it was with the typical feistiness that audiences have become used to seeing from him. He rushed out of the crease to create a full toss of a normal Benn delivery. The result was one, the intention was many more. <m2>Of the next 12 balls he faced, four reached the boundary</m2> and he had, singlehandedly, released the pressure. #p#Graeme Smith was not feeling well, and between trying to breathe through his blocked nose and call from his hoarse voicebox, he welcomed not having to bear the responsibility of steering the innings as well. "AB played a fantastic knock, he is a great one-day player and I was able to just hang in there with him," Smith said. #p#<m3>By the time de Villiers got to 50</m3>, <m4>Smith had scored a laboured 32 off 56 balls</m4>. His batting was uglier than usual to watch and even he admitted it "wasn't the best" knock he has played, but with de Villiers doing the driving - both literally, to exquisite effect, and figuratively - Smith could allow himself to relinquish control. It was de Villiers who did the bulk of the work - the nudging and nurdling, the well placed sweeps and fine dabbles and lashing out when necessary while Smith poked, pushed prodded and occasionally inside edged. #p#"He played like a senior player," Darren Sammy, the West Indies captain, said after the match. He didn't elaborate much but what he probably meant was that de Villiers was the one who first wrestled the match away from them and then strategised on timing the victory. It was his way of saying that de Villiers was the big daddy on the night and de Villiers' knock was his way of showing, yet again, that he is capable of doing the job of wicketkeeper and being one of the best batsmen in the side. #p#Corrie van Zyl, the South Africa coach, always knew that de Villiers would have no problem with the dual role. "I don't think there has been any doubt in our mind or in AB's mind that he can do it. Other people have had doubts," he said. "We understand that it's not easy but it is something that AB is willing to do." #p#The decision to use de Villiers in the role that previously belonged to Mark Boucher has faced a barrage of criticism with some saying that it robbed of the team of its best fielder at point, while others that it will affect his prowess with the bat if he has to hold the gloves as well. He has proved, for the fifth time since taking over as one-day wicketkeeper that that is simply not true. #p#In 27 of his 115 ODIs, he has been the wicketkeeper and has an average one-and-a-half times better than his average when he doesn't have the responsibility of carrying the gloves. He has scored 10 centuries in his one-day career, five of them in the 27 matches in which he has been the wicketkeeper. Three of them have been against Zimbabwe and two against West Indies, the context of which may make that statistic look a little less impressive, but he also has an unbeaten 82 and a score of 60 against Australia in the role of wicketkeeper batsman. It may still take a big innings against tougher opposition before the detractors will be willing to admit defeat, and at the rate de Villiers is going, that knock isn't far off.

Associated Press Enlarge Related Links Matches: Australia v New Zealand at Nagpur | Kenya v Pakistan at Hambantota Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Australia | New Zealand #p#Big Picture #p#It's almost as if there is malicious glee that follows Australia's so-called decline. Ashes lost? Yay! Ricky Ponting accidentally breaks a TV set? What irresponsible behaviour! Australia are struggling against spinners? Wonderful! In some ways, it's human nature to gloat at Goliath's fall. At the centre of the storm is Ponting, trying hard to regain his batting form, trying to hide the Ashes blot in his CV with another World-Cup triumph. In Australia's previous victorious campaigns, Ponting has led from the front with the bat but this time a question mark hovers around that possibility. Australia's campaign in this edition of the World Cup could well revolve around Ponting's form at No. 3. He got couple of hard-earned fifties in the warm-up games and looked to be slowly progressing towards recovering his touch. #p#The bowling is led by another ageing campaigner, Brett Lee, who is scripting a remarkable comeback. Much has been written about Australia's attack which stands out for its naked violence. The feeling is that they will either scythe through the opposition or fail to control the run-flow on these batting tracks. #p#On the other side, there is New Zealand, who are playing this game under the grim background of the Christchurch earthquake. "For a lot of the guys, coming to training has allowed them to take their mind off things," Daniel Vettori said. New Zealand have had a poor build-up to the World Cup, but they started the tournament with a crushing win against Kenya. Their batting line-up looks quite strong with the likes of Brendon McCullum, Martin Guptill, Jesse Ryder, Ross Taylor and Scott Styris and it's their bowling which looks a bit iffy. Will their seamers be able to adapt to these tracks? Much will depend on spinners Vettori and Nathan McCullum, who is likely to open the bowling with the new ball. New Zealand will hope that the pitch will take some turn and they can poke at Australia's vulnerability against spin on these slow tracks. It should be an interesting battle. #p#Form guide (Most recent first for the last five completed games) Australia : WWWWL New Zealand : LWLLL #p#Watch out for  Shane Watson's revival began here in India during the inaugural edition of the IPL. He adapted brilliantly and transformed himself into a smashing opener and took that form and confidence to the international stage. On Indian tracks, he likes to get on the front foot and scythe through the line. With Brad Haddin yet to learn the art of converting starts and with Ponting yet to get a regain his form completely, much will depend on Watson to set a solid platform. #p#Nathan McCullum is not a bowler who causes sleepless nights to batsmen but he could play a crucial role if Vettori decides to give him the new ball. He is accurate and spins the ball just enough to pose some problems. How he handles the pressure of bowling against Watson, Haddin and co might well decide how New Zealand fare with the ball. #p#Team news New Zealand have chosen their playing 12. Kyle Mills, Kane Williamson, and Luke Woodcock will miss out. #p#New Zealand (probable): 1 Martin Guptill, 2 Brendon McCullum (wk), 3 Jesse Ryder, 4 Ross Taylor, 5 James Franklin, 6 Scott Stryis, 7 Jacob Oram, 8 Daniel Vettori, 9 Nathan McCullum, 10 Hamish Bennett, 11 Tim Southee #p#Australia (probable) 1 Shane Watson, 2 Brad Haddin (wk), 3 Ricky Ponting (capt), 4 Michael Clarke, 5 David Hussey, 6 Cameron White, 7 Steve Smith, 8 Mitchell Johnson, 9 Jason Krezja, 10 Brett Lee, 11 Shaun Tait. #p#Try picking the XIs for tomorrow's game by playing Team Selector. #p#Stats and trivia #p#Ricky Ponting is the player who has played the most World Cup games. He has played 40 matches, going past Glenn McGrath's 39 appearances. He has also led Australia 23 times, the second-highest by any World Cup captain, after New Zealand's Stephen Fleming (27). Australia are yet to lose a World Cup game under Ponting. #p#In the game against Zimbabwe, Ponting became the fourth batsman in the World Cup to be run out on five occasions. The others are: Inzamam-ul-Haq (9), Asanka Gurusinha (6) and Javed Miandad (5) #p#Australia have faced New Zealand 123 times and have won 84 games. In India, these two teams have played against each other seven times, with Australia victorious in all seven. #p#Quotes #p#"Nothing really changes from any team you're playing in the subcontinent, you try and bowl straight at the wickets and you know you're going to have to score a lot of runs. There's no mystery to what we're going to try to do, but the key when you come up against these big teams and big players is having the presence of mind to execute time and time again. That's the toughest thing when you're coming up against good players." #p#Daniel Vettori on facing Australia
8	502789	Australia v NZ, Group A, World Cup 2011, Nagpur	Ponting hopes Krejza can relive debut heroics	Brydon Coverdale in Nagpur	February 24, 2011	#p#Jason Krejza has spent more than two years in the cricket wilderness, so it's no surprise that he is loving every minute of his return to the top level. And if he was excited just to get the World Cup call-up, imagine how he has felt over the past few days as he prepared to return to Nagpur, the venue of debut Test, when he picked up 12 wickets, for Friday's clash against New Zealand. #p#"He's been pretty excited about coming back," Ricky Ponting said on Thursday afternoon, before the Australians hit the nets. "He wanted to come down and train early this morning, to tell you the truth, and we had to hold him back." #p#It was in November 2008 that offspinner Krejza made one of the most memorable debuts in recent history, when he collected 8 for 215 in the first innings against India, and another four wickets in the second. But the axe came after he failed to stem the runs against South Africa in his second Test, in Perth, the following month, and since then he has been in and out of the Tasmania side. #p#But now Krejza has reinvented himself as an ODI bowler; still a wicket-taker, but one who can play a defensive role when necessary. His chance came because of injuries to Nathan Hauritz, Xavier Doherty and Steve O'Keefe, and after a nervy debut against England in Perth, he has started to find his rhythm. #p#Against Zimbabwe, in Australia's opening game of the World Cup, he built on the good work of the fast men and collected 2 for 28 from his eight overs, and he will play an important role throughout the rest of the campaign. Ponting hopes that a confident return to Nagpur on Friday could kickstart a strong tournament for Krejza, who will share the spin duties with Steve Smith and the part-timers. #p#"To have that feeling, to know the venue and know the wicket conditions really well will definitely help him," Ponting said. "I think in all honesty, every game he's played on the tour, he's improved and got better. The first two practice games and then the hit-out against Zimbabwe, I think he bowled particularly well. #p#"He's a wicket-taker, we know that. He puts a lot of revs on the ball, he spins the ball and at different times, with conditions looking like they have so far, there are not many wickets that haven't spun during this tournament, and he could be a really important player for us as this tournament progresses." #p#Adding to the importance of spin in the match against New Zealand is the early start, with a 9.30 am (local) opening so that fans in Australia and New Zealand can watch it at a reasonable hour. That means that dew shouldn't be an issue. #p#"There's been a lot of talk about dew being a major factor but with it being a day game, it shouldn't be much of a factor so it should make the contest a bit more even and fairer," Ponting said. "Big scores have been made here and that indicates it's a very good batting wicket; even the game here played the other night, there were a lot of runs and the wicket seemed to hold together very well and didn't change much during the course of the game." #p#As well as hoping for a strong performance from their own slow bowlers, the Australians must ensure they handle New Zealand's spinners with aplomb, after struggling against Ray Price and his colleagues on Monday. Nathan McCullum is likely to open the bowling, while Daniel Vettori also practised with the new ball in the nets on Thursday, and Ponting said his men were ready for the challenge. #p#"We've had a good talk about that this morning. I think they might do that; we think it might be McCullum that might do it," he said. "We're also prepared for Vettori, and Price opened the bowling the other day for Zimbabwe and did a good job against the right-handers, so there's also that option there for New Zealand if that's the way they want to go. We'll be well prepared." #p#The Australians arrived in Nagpur on Wednesday night, after staying on for an extra couple of days in Ahmedabad after their opening game. The Chappell-Hadlee Trophy will also be up for grabs on Friday, while the players will wear black armbands and observe a minute's silence before the game in tribute to the victims of the Christchurch earthquake.
8	502800	Australia v NZ, Group A, World Cup 2011, Nagpur	New Zealand aim to rise above tragedy	Nagraj Gollapudi in Nagpur	February 24, 2011	#p#The big question for New Zealand is: how do the players forget the trauma and suffering of their people back home in the aftermath of the catastrophe in Christchurch? Cricket can act as a distraction for a while, but how can John Wright, Hamish Bennett or Brendon McCullum (they live in Christchurch) or for the matter the rest of the squad, who have friends and relatives in the affected zone, entirely rid themselves of painful thoughts and instead create a competitive bubble to operate in? No one can be that numb. #p#Yet Friday's contest could probably put New Zealand back in the right frame of mind because they have always managed to pick themselves up and bring their best game to the table when playing their arch rivals. The teams will also be contesting for the Chappell-Hadlee trophy and this will up the intensity for them as both Australia and New Zealand have always scrapped hard in the bilateral affair. Not to forget, New Zealand have a score to settle, having lost the trophy 2-3 at home last year. #p#Little wonder that there was a renewed sense of purpose about New Zealand's training on Thursday. Even the absence of two key members from the support staff - their physiotherapist and trainer - did not deter them as both players and the coaching staff joined hands to fill the void. It did not matter that New Zealand's resources looked depleted as compared to those of Australia, who had eight support staff members, including David Boon (a national selector) on hand. In comparison New Zealand's players had just three helping hands. #p#One of them, John Wright, the commander of the New Zealand ship, was busy. From timing the batsmen's stints at the nets, to giving an encouraging word or suggestion, or consulting captain Daniel Vettori while keeping a watchful tab on the batsmen's technique, Wright kept the pulse of the New Zealand camp energetic. The former India coach was back home and he was making sure his wards felt the same. #p#Allan Donald, New Zealand's bowling coach, readily doubled up as a wicketkeeper sans pads, as he tried his best to read the ball from the hands of the spin pair of Vettori and Nathan McCullum. Both did not mind the slip-ups, having a hearty laugh every time Donald moved in the opposite direction to the spin. Earlier, Donald, who joined the team during the Pakistan series at home recently, had lined up as second slip, standing next to Ross Taylor, as Wright was giving them catch practice. Once again Donald, never a slip fielder during his South Africa days, had his team-mates in splits, dropping a catch. But far from being embarrassed, Donald was doing his best to keep the spirits positive in the camp. Jacob Oram was the other field marshal on the day as he studiously observed his team-mates and passed on his suggestions. #p#"It has been difficult, but we put it in perspective and said it's nothing to what the people back home in Christchurch and the people all over New Zealand are going through, because it has affected the whole country. The whole country is hurting immensely, and the team feels exactly the same way," Vettori said about how the team was focussing to Friday's game. #p#Vettori said the importance of the clash was not lost on the players even though the last 48 hours had been an "incredibly" difficult after they woke up on Tuesday to news of the horrific earthquake. "It has been an incredibly tough build-up with what's going on. For a lot of the guys, coming to training has allowed them to take their mind off things," he said. "We know it's a big game in terms of the World Cup, but it's also a Chappell-Hadlee game, which means a lot to people back home, so I definitely think we'll be up for it and we're looking forward to it." #p#Still the task will not be easy. New Zealand have played 76 one-dayers from the last World Cup in 2007, and though their winning percentage is quite healthy with 32 wins to 35 losses, the figure gets skewed when limited to the subcontinent. They have only three wins from the 18 matches played across the three hosting countries of this World Cup. In the last one year they have suffered series whitewashes in Bangladesh and India. #p#New Zealand's Achilles heel in the subcontinent has been the inability of their batsmen to notch up a big score. But a day match tomorrow could probably allow them to get their eye in on what is likely to be a dry and flat pitch. New Zealand could also take advantage of Australia's vulnerability against spin; a growing concern for the defending champions, as Ricky Ponting admitted. New Zealand had started with spin in their game against Kenya and today the pair of Vettori and McCullum practised with the new ball, a possible indicator that they wouldn't mind starting with a slow bowler once again. #p#Vettori said New Zealand were confident carrying forward the momentum they established in Chennai after their 10-wicket thrashing of Kenya last week. "We have to look at ourselves in the best possible light. When we do perform we're a very good team. Unfortunately over the last little while we haven't been able to live up to those expectations. Hopefully we can take the positives of a comprehensive victory against Kenya through to this game but we know it's going to be a different challenge, a lot tougher challenge." #p#Vettori, however, knows a victory in these troubled times will carry more weight and bring small cheer to a nation in mourning.

Indian success Players/Officials: Mitchell Johnson | Brett Lee | Nathan McCullum | Shaun Tait | Daniel Vettori Matches: Australia v New Zealand at Nagpur Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Australia | New Zealand #p#Shaun Tait. Brett Lee. Mitchell Johnson. The hostile fast men from Australia made an imperious statement in Nagpur. They breathed fire and New Zealand didn't have the heart, and at least today, the skills, to extinguish them. <m11>Nathan McCullum and Daniel Vettori revived New Zealand from a disastrous 73 for 6</m11>, but <m12>a below-par 206</m12> was not enough to avoid a crushing defeat. A flamboyant <m13>Brad Haddin and an imperious Shane Watson hit entertaining half-centuries</m13> to charge Australia home. #p#It was a shambolic effort from the New Zealand top order. Some of the deliveries didn't deserve wickets but New Zealand were in the mood for self-destruction. They handled the best bowler on view, Lee, with caution and <m14>gave him just one wicket</m14> but imploded against Tait and Johnson. Both bowlers bowled enough tight deliveries to lure the batsmen into mistakes with deliveries that had some teasing width. It remains to be seen how they will fare against a better batting line-up. Will today's wicket-taking deliveries be smashed for boundaries or will the batsmen continue to err on perceived pressure-releasing balls? Today, though, their efforts were enough to blow away New Zealand's top order. #p#<m15>Brendon McCullum, who unfurled couple of fierce upper cuts against Tait</m15>, <m16>threw his bat at a full delivery well outside off, but edged it to third man</m16>. <m17>Jesse Ryder, who laced a few classy pulls against Johnson</m17>, <m18>stabbed a delivery that held its line outside off, to the wicketkeeper</m18>. <m19>James Franklin, looking out of place at No. 5, chased a wide delivery from Johnson to give Brad Haddin another catch</m19>. <m20>Scott Styris edged a wide and short delivery from Tait to Haddin</m20> and <m21>Ross Taylor played all around a full delivery from Tait to lose his off stump</m21>. #p#Everything that one expected from this Australian pace attack was visible today. It was expected they would either blow away the opposition or leak runs on flat tracks. <m22>Eleven fours came in the first 12 overs but the wickets too kept tumbling</m22>. Lee strangled the batsmen with his nagging line and length, Tait slung them in full and fast, Johnson went round-arm to catapult pacy deliveries and Watson was accurate enough to let the vagaries of the up-and-down track to do its bit. #p#<m23>The pitch played its part in the dismissal of Martin Guptill</m23>, which proved to be a turning point of the innings as well. Guptill had just begun to get going after taking 19 deliveries to get off the mark, when <m24>he was late to get on the front foot to a delivery from Watson that shot through low under the bat to bowl him</m24>. <m25>When Guptill fell in the ninth over</m25>, <m26>New Zealand were 40 for 2</m26> but it was the beginning of the end. <m27>By the 17th over</m27>, after <m28>the fall of Taylor</m28>, <m29>they were tottering at 73 for 6</m29>. #p#In many ways, <m30>Taylor's dismissal</m30> captured New Zealand's iffy batting effort. <m31>It was a full delivery on the off stump line and instead of driving it in the 'V', Taylor, who averages just 28.86 since March 2009, played a messy across-the-line waft to lose his stumps.</m31> #p#Luckily, for New Zealand, <m32>they found in Nathan McCullum, someone in good form - this is his third fifty</m32> in four innings - and in the mood to play risk-free cricket, to save them the blushes. He played the situation well, using his dab-nudge routine to collect the singles and putting away the occasional long hops from the spinners as boundaries. <m33>The fifty came with a steer to point</m33> but for the main part, he nurdled the ball to the leg side - 33 runs came in that region - to keep the score moving. <m34>He came in at 73 for 6</m34> and by the time <m35>he fell in the 42nd over, trapped lbw by a skidding delivery from Johnson</m35>, <m36>he had pushed New Zealand to 175 for 8</m36>. <m37>Nathan McCullum was well supported by Vettori</m37>, who bided his time before playing the big shots in the end overs to push the score past 200. <m38>Vettori fell in the 45th over, edging an attempted pull off Lee</m38> and he will be left musing yet another debacle from his top order. #p#In contrast, the Australian openers oozed intent in the chase. <m39>Haddin punctuated his violent hits with some sweetly-timed drives to waltz through to a half-century</m39> while <m40>Watson heaved, slugged, muscled, thumped and carved his way to a merry fifty</m40>. <m41>The best shot of the day came from Haddin when he unfurled a gorgeous drive against Nathan McCullum. Haddin leaned forward to an off break to caress it through extra cover</m41>, a shot out of the Damien Martyn school of batting. The openers' brutal effort was the perfect icing on the cake after the stirring show from the fast bowlers. #p#Match Timeline

Matches: Australia v New Zealand at Nagpur Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Australia | New Zealand #p#Poignant moment of the day. The teams lined up for their national anthems in the lead-up to the first ball wearing black armbands in recognition of the lives lost in the Christchurch earthquake, and when they came out after the change of innings they shared a minute's silence. "I thought that was great for both the teams to get together and show both their respects for what has happened," Ricky Ponting said. "The New Zealanders are neighbours of ours and almost like our brothers." #p#Stumping of the day. Glenn McGrath famously declared that he didn't want to be credited with the wicket when Adam Gilchrist, up to the stumps to the fast man, whipped the bails off and stumped Craig McMillan at the Basin Reserve in 2005. <m2>Tim Southee is probably not quite as precious, and he would have been thrilled with the sharp work of Brendon McCullum to snare a leg-side wide and drag the ball back to the stumps to get rid of Ricky Ponting</m2>. It was a brilliant piece of wicketkeeping, the second in a few days after the Dutch gloveman Wesley Barresi stumped Jonathan Trott down the leg side off Ryan ten Doeschate. Hopefully Ponting reacted in the dressing rooms by placing his equipment gently in his kit bag and saying "oh, drat" #p#Over of the day. By the first drinks break, <m3>New Zealand had lost both openers</m3> but were beginning to steady the ship. That was until the first over after the break, when <m4>Mitchell Johnson produced an excellent delivery to have Jesse Ryder caught behind when the ball nipped away</m4>. <m5>Enter James Franklin</m5>, who Ricky Ponting was surprised to see batting so high in the order. <m6>Exit James Franklin. A horrible drive well away from his body, with no footwork, and Franklin was caught behind for a third-ball duck.</m6> <m7>It was a double-wicket maiden from Johnson</m7>, and New Zealand's innings was in tatters. #p#Try of the day. Returning in his second spell, <m8>Brett Lee fired in a short delivery at Jamie How, who did well to tap it down with soft hands before setting off for a single. But Lee, halfway into his follow through, dashed forward, came up with a sliding dive, before picking the ball, turning back and throwing at the stumps at the opposite end, all in one motion. How had made his crease to beat the perfect throw but Lee, always a dynamic presence on field, got a handsome cheer from the crowd.</m8> #p#Mistake of the day. It was Daniel Vettori's decision to delay <m9>the batting Powerplay</m9>, especially when <m10>both he and Nathan McCullum were trying to repair the extensive damage</m10> inflicted on them by the Australian fast bowlers earlier. Eventually <m11>Vettori opted for the Powerplay in the 43rd over</m11> but by then New Zealand had only two wickets in a hand, showing how insensible a move it was. <m12>In the final count New Zealand folded up with 29 balls to spare, 17 of them from the Powerplay.</m12> #p#Drought of the day. As a one-day opener, a quick start is usually the aim, but Martin Guptill was in no hurry against the speed of Brett Lee and Shaun Tait. <m13>Guptill didn't score from his first 18 balls</m13>, before <m14>he finally punched a drive through cover off Lee from his 19th</m14>. By the time he scored his first run, his opening partner <m15>Brendon McCullum was already back in the pavilion</m15> with 16 and <m16>Jesse Ryder was on 5</m16>. Unfortunately for the New Zealanders, <m17>Guptill didn't use his steady start as a platform, and was bowled by a skidding Shane Watson delivery for 10 off 25</m17>.
8	502992	Australia v New Zealand, Group A, World Cup 2011, Nagpur	Sticking to strengths brings Johnson Indian success	Brydon Coverdale at the VCA Stadium	February 25, 2011	#p#Which foreign player has taken the most ODI wickets in India? Muttiah Muralitharan? Glenn McGrath? Courtney Walsh? Wrong, wrong and wrong again. As of today, it's Mitchell Johnson. After a year of frustrating Australian fans and testing the patience of the selectors, who finally dropped him during the Ashes, Johnson is looming as a key man at this World Cup, and he was instrumental in the <m1>seven-wicket win over New Zealand</m1>. #p#<m2>It was a double-wicket maiden from Johnson</m2> that sparked Australia's dominance in the field, and he returned to finish New Zealand off after they had climbed to a vaguely respectable score having milked the spin of Jason Krejza and Steven Smith. <m3>It gave him 4 for 33</m3> to add to his figures of 4 for 19 in the opener against Zimbabwe, and he's an early leader on the tournament wicket tally. #p#<m4>And when he had last man Tim Southee caught skying an attempted slog</m4>, Johnson joined Winston Benjamin with 36 one-day wickets in India, although Benjamin took six more matches to get there. At first glance, it seems odd that one of Australia's most unpredictable fast men should thrive in conditions that offer pace bowlers so little assistance. #p#But in part, that's one of the secrets to Johnson's success here. In England and at times in Australia, he has tried to bend it like Beckham, only to spray it like a sprinkler. In India, there is no expectation that he will swing the ball, so he is free to bowl in his natural style, angling the ball across with slight variations in movement off the pitch, and getting the occasional one to lift into the ribs. #p#"It just suits my bowling, I guess, the bang-the-wicket kind of bowling that I like, and the change-ups that I use," Johnson said of bowling in India. "I just really enjoy the challenges over here of these conditions. I saw the game between the Netherlands and England and it looked like a pretty good wicket. I just had in the back of my mind I wanted to bang it in to the wicket like I did against Zimbabwe and probably not think about it too much, but just go out there and enjoy myself." #p#In Nagpur, <m5>he found just the right length and nipped the ball away a fraction to draw an edge from Jesse Ryder</m5>, a plan that he had spoken to Ricky Ponting about earlier in the spell, and <m6>three balls later James Franklin flashed outside off and edged behind</m6>. <m7>New Zealand sank to 6 for 73 soon afterwards</m7>, but Ponting put Johnson on ice while the spinners sped through the middle overs to make up time for a slow over rate. #p#<m8>In his first over back, Johnson struck again, trapping the half-centurion Nathan McCullum lbw. The ball pitched just inside the leg-stump line and kept going with the arm, and would have taken off stump</m8>. Johnson's speed and angle make him a tough customer when he's on song - and when he's not flinging wides - and he could be the big wicket-taker in an attack also featuring Brett Lee and Shaun Tait. #p#That should take nothing away from the efforts of Lee, who bowled superbly to keep the runs down early, tying down <m9>Martin Guptill, who was then bowled by Shane Watson</m9>. And <m10>Tait, despite spraying his first two balls for wides</m10>, <m11>picked up three wickets</m11> and <m12>shattered the stumps of Ross Taylor, who was beaten for pace</m12>. #p#"He probably hasn't bowled as well as he can with the brand new ball just yet, and today is a pretty good example of that," Ponting said of Tait. "He's just got to keep it in the back of his head that he's going to get probably four or five spells to come back and have an impact for us. He had an impact in his second spell today and his third spell. That's what we can keep up our sleeve with someone like him, we've always got that strike power when we need it." #p#Even <m13>Krejza, whose nine overs cost 47</m13>, won praise from the captain for bowling better than his figures suggested. He's another man who knows what it's like to take big bags in India, but he'll have to fight Johnson for the spoils in this World Cup.
8	502993	Australia v New Zealand, Group A, World Cup 2011, Nagpur	New Zealand batsmen mess it up again	S Rajesh	February 25, 2011	#p#New Zealand's shambolic top-order batting ruined another match which was billed as one of the big ones of the group stage of the World Cup. The format of the tournament means such games, involving two Test-playing sides, are rare to start with, and it doesn't help when these games become one-sided as well. The South Africa-West Indies game was a no-contest as well, which means two matches in two days have failed to live up to expectations. #p#This time around, the fault squarely lay with New Zealand's batsmen, who put in another depressingly familiar and limp display. In 116 ODIs since the beginning of 2006, New Zealand have lost half their side for less than 100 on 28 occasions - that's more than once every four matches, which is quite an indictment of their specialist batsmen. The corresponding numbers for India are 24 times in 160 matches (once every 6.67 games), for South Africa it's nine in 111 (once every 12.33 games), and for Australia it's once every 14 matches. #p#The way New Zealand's top batsmen went about tackling Australia's pace attack was quite perplexing - they forgot about the singles, and attempted low-percentage, high-risk shots. The result was a fair number of boundaries, but also plenty of dot balls and wickets. The most shocking stat was the fact that <m1>New Zealand managed all of four singles in the first 15 overs</m1>, which allowed Australia's bowlers to build and sustain pressure, and work on a batsman for prolonged periods. New Zealand scored two runs more than Australia off fours and sixes, and yet finished up 40 runs behind on the overall score at the end of 15 overs. #p#How NZ and Australia played the first 15 overs Team Score Dot balls Singles 2s/ 3s 4s/ 6s New Zealand 68 for 5 72 4 1/ 1 12/ 0 Australia 108 for 0 45 25 7/ 2 10/ 2 #p#Among the batsmen who disappointed was Ross Taylor, who continued a prolonged run of poor form: in the last two years (since March 1, 2009), Taylor averages 28.86 in 39 innings, with nine single-digit scores in his last 16 outings. #p#For Australia, on the other hand, there was little to be worried about, as they notched up their sixth World Cup win in eight matches against New Zealand. In each of the last three tournaments, <m2>the victory margins have been emphatic - 96 runs in 2003, 215 in 2007, and seven wickets this time</m2>. Brett Lee was arguably their best bowler, but <m3>Mitchell Johnson ended up with his second successive four-wicket haul</m3>, which makes him only the sixth bowler - and the third Australian - to achieve this in World Cups. The ones who've achieved it earlier are Gary Gilmour in 1975, Ashantha de Mel in 1983, Imran Khan in 1987, Shane Warne in 1999, and Muttiah Muralitharan in 2007. #p#And while New Zealand's No.4 is struggling, Australia's seems to have regained his mojo. <m4>Michael Clarke completed the formalities with an unbeaten 24</m4>, and in the process became the ninth Australian to reach the 6000-run mark in ODIs. In his last four innings he has scored 218 runs and been dismissed only twice. Ricky Ponting touched 13,000 runs in ODIs in which he represented Australia - he scored 115 in one match for ICC World XI - but also managed a less memorable milestone when he was stumped for the 15th time in his career, thus equalling Wasim Akram's record for the most number of such dismissals in ODIs.

8	503032	Australia v NZ, Group A, World Cup 2011, Nagpur	New Zealand's top seven woes	Nagraj Gollapudi in Nagpur	February 25, 2011	#p#<m1>Brendon McCullum, having hit two boundaries against a wayward Shaun Tait in his first over</m1>, <m2>slashed hard at a wide delivery in the bowler's next over only to be pouched easily at third man</m2>; <m3>Martin Guptill failed to go forward to a length ball, which kept low and hit his off stump</m3>; <m4>Jesse Ryder, feet static, chased and nicked a Mitchell Johnson delivery that moved away a wee bit after pitching on a length</m4>; <m5>Ross Taylor moved in trying to play across to an inswinging yorker that re-arranged his furniture</m5>; James Franklin and Scott Styris played shots they will never even attempt in the nets. #p#None of those deliveries were really unplayable. Few could have been actually left alone. On paper most of these names are a top cast and evoke a strong appeal, but come audition day they tend to fail miserably, and often. Firsthand it is difficult to know if the hurdles are more mental than technical. The one certainty is New Zealand's top order has had more troughs than peaks in the recent past. #p#In the last two years, New Zealand's top-order batsmen (Nos. 1 to 7) average the least among all full-member teams. In 25 matches since January 2009, New Zealand's top seven average 27.49. That is less than even Zimbabwe, whose batsmen score at 28.48 runs. The best teams like India and South Africa peak above the 40-run mark. Another damning number in the same period is the New Zealanders have registered 36 ducks, a record for any team. On a per match basis New Zealand have less than one fifty-plus score, which is lower than all other teams. #p#On the back of the disaster back home, it was pretty evident that New Zealand's players were a little bit distracted. But Daniel Vettori, a man who is stoic at the best of times, said later that they were professionals and the remorse felt back home could not be compared or used as an excuse for the dip in the performance today. So is it then the mental approach of players that is vulnerable? Considering the match had been designated for the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy, it was natural for the players to stay pumped up. Sadly, on Friday, there was only team which was high on adrenaline and it was not New Zealand. #p#Never once during their act did New Zealand look fluent and solid. They started slowly and grew more timid every over. <m6>In the first 15 overs, when the first two Powerplays were on, New Zealand had 78 dot balls and lost their top five batters</m6>. Australia had come out with a plan and Ricky Ponting deployed his pace arsenal of four quicks for the first 19 overs to combat the opponent. It worked wonders. "The pressure that Australia put on us in a number of different aspects really hurt us but in the end it was about wickets. It is more about psyching up the pressure and being able to repel that," Vettori said. He felt the batsmen could have hit back through coming back in the batting Powerplay but that never happened because there was no man left standing. #p#To begin with, McCullum was frenetically chasing everything Tait threw at him and trying to hit it hard. Considering he was facing the fastest bowler in the game, a better ploy could have been to just use the pace to his advantage. McCullum is New Zealand's senior-most top-order batsman, and the team looks to him to provide the ballistic starts he is famous for. But it is not mandatory that he needs to go guns blazing each time. He can study a like-minded batsman in Virender Sehwag, who is showing the determination to bat out as long as possible, which effectively helps India reach bigger totals. It is not necessary that McCullum has to go bashing in the first fifteen. If he can last longer he can always convert the final 15 overs into a Powerplay and use the long handle. His team will have no complaints. #p#It is just not McCullum who has cobwebs to clear. It is difficult to understand the reason a batsman like Ryder, who scored a brilliant 107 in the final match of the one-day series at home against Pakistan earlier in the month, cannot thread together two big scores on a trot. <m7>After the early fall of McCullum</m7>, New Zealand depended on Ryder to provide the thrust. He gladly licked Johnson when he failed to get enough height on some short-pitched deliveries aimed at Ryder's hips. A few words were exchanged and Ryder was not shy to open his mouth. But then when Johnson pitched it a little fuller Ryder grew circumspect. #p#"The two balls in the over before [which Ryder pulled for fours] I did not get them right. I obviously fed him on his hips where he likes them," Johnson said. But Johnson improvised his length immediately. "I actually said to Ricky that I just felt I would nick him off from that good length. Fortunately he nicked it for me. Not sure the plan of bowling short and not getting it up worked but just bowling that good length worked." #p#That was the case with most other batsmen. Australia had many plans today. New Zealand had barely any answers. Vettori was concerned. "We have got very good players in the top 5. We just need to be stand up and be counted particularly in these big games. They have got the skills, but we have to look it as a unit. We got to find a way to find a result." #p#New Zealand's top five can learn a lot from the grit of Nathan McCullum, who has hit three half-centuries in his last four innings. If he can dig in deep, why not the rest.
8	503088			Tim Scoular		Choice of game. What better way to finish a three-month stint in India than seeing a World Cup match? I couldn't think of one so I planned a trip to Nagpur to observe the ANZAC battle for Trans-Tasman bragging rights.  #p# Team supported. A quick look at the two flags would leave you very puzzled as to why neither team wore red and/or blue, but I was kitted up in green and gold and was firmly behind the team whose flag displays white stars on their Southern Cross.  #p# World Cup prediction. South Africa have been my tip for the trophy, but now that I've tipped them they will have no chance, so Australia (patriotism being my key source of logic) or more likely India, with Pakistan being the dark horses to reach the semis.  #p# Accessories. I ensured that I was equipped with my Indian survival kit - sunscreen, insect repellent and hand sanitiser. Apart from those, a hat and sunglasses proved to be worthy companions on the day.  #p# Key performer. <m1>Brad Haddin played an explosive innings and was the one batsman during the match to really play aggressively from the beginning</m1>. Whether dancing down the wicket to lift the ball over the infield or piercing the covers with his stylish drives, he gave the Black Caps no chance of restricting Australia.  #p# One thing I'd have changed. I would have given New Zealand an extra 150 runs and see how Australia went about chasing. If anyone still follows the "double the total after 30 overs" rule, then Australia were on track for around 360. I would of course demand to have the option of returning the New Zealand total to 206 should Australia not have made the runs.  #p# Face-off. I relished I have been a long-time admirer of Daniel Vettori and New Zealand's ability to create strong leaders. Still a very underrated spinner, and his battle against Australia's spin-resistant middle order was going to be exciting. As it panned out he didn't really have a chance to bowl at them when under pressure, instead he opened the bowling and didn't have any impact on <m2>the imposing Haddin-Watson combination</m2>.  #p# Wow moment. Before the Australian innings, both teams mixed and embraced to share a minute's silence for those who have suffered in the horrendous Christchurch earthquake. The silent huddle was formed by ambassadors of two countries which have endured all nature can throw at them in the last six months, and it assured all that the ANZAC spirit is still very much alive.  #p# Shot of the day. <m3>Shane Watson's swipe through wide mid-on was the defining shot of a man-mountain in full swing. I say "through" because it was certainly not over anyone - the ball's path peaked at one metre above ground level and nearly carried the boundary for six.</m3> It had everyone in the crowd nearby ducking for cover.  #p# Crowd meter. The stands were by no means packed, however what they lacked in population, they made up for with noise. The loudest were without doubt the locals who came to worship their favourite game, and they cheered every drum beat, single and wicket.  #p# Fancy-dress index. One of the great sights often occurring at Australian sporting contests overseas is the emergence of an AFL jumper. Today a Hawthorn Hawks fan was wearing his yellow and brown with pride as he cheered on his countrymen in the middle.  #p# Entertainment. The World Cup theme song got a very good run over the PA.. I still have no idea what it means as I don't speak Hindi (or Hinglish for that matter).  #p# Banner of the day. Often these are hurriedly written on paper by spectators who have sourced a permanent marker, but my favourite was a banner which had been planned for weeks. Hyundai's "4" and "6" posters all had slogans on the back. Deciding against witty or comedic words, the writers opted to educate the players on how to play the game. The two posters which I was handed outside the ground included the phrases "catch the ball" and "that's called a straight drive." Perhaps they were inspired by England's fielding effort at the same ground during which it seemed that neither Kevin Pietersen nor James Anderson were aware of what to do when the ball is hit in the air.  #p# Ticketing woes. The only thing more bemusing than the calculation of the "Castrol Index" (I don't know what it is either, just that Shane Watson is 180 odd and that Australia was 100 points ahead of New Zealand by the end of the game) was the ticketing. Despite booking tickets months in advance, my comrades and I were forced to wait outside a plastic shack before the game until one man and a laptop arrived via rickshaw. When coupled with the dramas in Bangalore and Mumbai, maybe ticketing is something the ICC needs to rethink before the next World Cup.  #p# ODIs v Twenty20. Twenty20 has given a much-needed boost to the domestic level of the game, however at an international level ODIs are still a more interesting and exciting format.  #p# Marks out of 10. 10. Australia played well but need to learn how to rip through a tail. It has become a worrying trend during their time in India. The atmosphere was pretty good once the stands filled halfway through New Zealand's innings. I would definitely suggest a cricket game to anyone wanting to get a full experience of India.

AFP Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: Jamie How | John Wright Matches: Australia v New Zealand at Nagpur Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: New Zealand #p#John Wright, the New Zealand coach, has defended the team's decision to pick Jamie How ahead of allrounder Jacob Oram and Kyle Mills in the defeat against Australia in Nagpur. New Zealand went in with an extra specialist batsman with <m2>How, a regular opener who was dropped down to No.7, making 22</m2> in <m3>his team's score of 206</m3>. #p#The match was New Zealand's first major fixture of this World Cup and Wright, while acknowledging the ploy didn't pay off, said the team had decided to strengthen its batting against a potent Australian pace attack. "We wanted to strengthen our batting because we knew Australia would come at us with pace on a number of fronts," Wright said of How's inclusion. "Particularly around that secondary ball, we thought it would be nice to have a guy who can play pace well and Jamie is a very good player of pace to counter that. #p#"But it didn't work, did it?" #p#Wright confirmed Mills was fit for the game, and said he will get his chance against Zimbabwe on March 4 in New Zealand's next fixture. "Kyle's back to full fitness. He's trained well the last two days, but we felt that the two pace bowlers and two spinners against Australia was the right option so he'll get his opportunity in the next game."
9	502777	Bangladesh v Ireland, Group B, World Cup 2011, Mirpur	A match crucial to quarter-final qualification	The Preview by Sidharth Monga	February 24, 2011	#p#Match Facts #p#February 25, Mirpur Start time 14:30 local time (08:30 GMT) #p#Ed Joyce is back in the Ireland set-up after playing the 2007 World Cup for England Associated Press Enlarge Related Links Matches: Bangladesh v Ireland at Dhaka Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Bangladesh | Ireland #p#Big Picture #p#For the last week, it has been somewhat quiet in Dhaka, but come Friday it won't be so. On paper, this is a match between two lowly ranked sides in the ODI hierarchy, but it will have huge implications in terms of progress to the next round. Bangladesh know it will be near impossible to make the quarter-finals, something the passionate fans and the team want desperately, if they fail to beat Ireland. Ireland also harbour ambitions of making the next round, and they know this is their best chance of beating a Test side. They also know they will need to beat at least two of them if they are to extend their stay in the event. #p#The implications of this game, however, are deeper than that. On one side is a team many believe got Test status too early and too easily, and is still struggling to justify it 11 years on. On the other side is a team many believe has done enough to at least merit a full-time ODI status: Ireland have beaten Bangladesh in the two major events the teams have played each other in. With Ireland also rests the flag of the beleaguered Associate nations, because they have been the best Associate side over the last four years or so. #p#Bangladesh might have lost to Ireland in the world events, but they will take heart from having beaten them 3-0 the only time they have met each other in Bangladesh. A similar trap - a low and slow pitch - is likely to be laid. Given the conditions will obviously suit the Bangladesh spin army, and the kind of crowd that this match will attract - something Ireland will never have encountered before - the hosts will start favourites. That said, it will be tough to keep a spirited side down, a side that gets one chance in four years to show the world what it is capable of. That is motivation enough. #p#Form guide (Most recent first) #p#Bangladesh : LWWWL #p#Ireland : WLLWL #p#Pitch and conditions #p#Expect a surface that will assist the Bangladesh spinners. It might be difficult to prepare a square turner in Mirpur, but it is likely to stay low. The expected dew played a role in Shakib Al Hasan's decision to put India in last week - a tactic that backfired - and Shakib says he isn't expecting much dew now. He said there hasn't been much dew around. William Porterfield, the Ireland captain, though, said there was a little bit of dew when the team practised under lights two nights before the match. #p#Watch out for  #p#Tamim Iqbal struggled against India while the other two left-hand batsmen in the top order got off to good starts. Tamim decided to fight, and didn't hit out. One school of thought suggests that is just the kind of defeatist mentality Bangladesh need to get rid of - the tendency of batsmen going for batting practice when the target is big. The other school of thought, Bangladesh's, suggests Tamim started hitting the ball well by the end of the innings. Tamim said he was feeling better about his form after that scratchy knock, and we can expect the real Tamim in the next game. #p#Ed Joyce is back in green. After playing a crucial role in Ireland's qualification for the 2007 World Cup, Joyce chose to play for England and pursue a Test career, which is not possible with Ireland. He didn't savour the journey his home team embarked on in the Caribbean, nor has he managed to represent England in Tests. Now he is back, and is welcomed with open arms. "If I can bring something in terms of calmness in the middle of the innings where, perhaps, it wasn't there before, that would be nice to offer," he told Irish Times last week. #p#Team news #p#Bangladesh have had injury scares coming into the match, but Imrul Kayes is fit despite getting hit in the forearm in the nets on Wednesday. He batted in the nets on match eve, and will open with Tamim. However, Shafiul Islam, who took a bad fall during fielding practice on Wednesday, is not a sure starter. That could prompt Bangladesh to think more of their traditional strength, and perhaps go with four spinners. There has also been talk that Mohammad Ashraful might be back, but at No. 7, as a Powerplay specialist. #p#Bangladesh (probable): 1 Tamim Iqbal, 2 Imrul Kayes, 3 Junaid Siddique, 4 Mushfiqur Rahim (wk), 5 Shakib Al Hasan (capt), 6 Raqibul Hasan, 7 Mohammad Ashraful, 8 Mahmudullah, 9 Naeem Islam/Suhrawadi Shuvo, 10 Abdur Razzak, 11 Rubel Hossain. #p#Ireland will be happy to welcome back Boyd Rankin (coming back from injury) and Joyce (coming back from England). That gives them real decisions to make when they sit to pick the XI, but expect two spinners in it. #p#Ireland (probable): 1 William Porterfield (capt), 2 Paul Stirling, 3 Andre Botha, 4 Ed Joyce, 5 Niall O'Brien (wk), 6 Kevin O'Brien, 7 Andrew White, 8 John Mooney, 9 Trent Johnston, 10 Boyd Rankin, 11 George Dockrell/Albert van der Merwe. #p#Try picking the XIs for tomorrow's game by playing Team Selector. #p#Stats and trivia #p#Bangladesh lead the head-to-head against Ireland 4-2. #p#In the 2007 World Cup, Ireland had only two professional cricketers; this time they have only two who don't play cricket full time. #p#Since August 2009, Tamim has averaged 37 as opposed to a career average of 30, and has gone at a strike-rate of 94, which is also a huge improvement over his career strike-rate of 79. Two of his three centuries have come in this period. #p#Quotes #p#"[Ireland might have beaten us at world events], but when they played at Mirpur in 2008, we beat them three games in a row. So we have the home advantage. I don't think they like to play in these conditions." Shakib Al Hasan looks to home conditions and crowd. #p#"Obviously 2007 was quite a while ago. We won on that occasion, but it's going to be different in these conditions as opposed to what it was in the West Indies. Bangladesh are playing at home, they have got the home support, they have got the home conditions, so it is a completely different occasion." William Porterfield is aware of the whole new ball game.
9	502812	Bangladesh v Ireland, Group B, World Cup 2011, Mirpur	'It is a must-win situation' - Shakib	Sidharth Monga in Mirpur	February 24, 2011	#p#On the eve of the big Group B clash - even though it is between two low-ranked teams, neither captain wants to underestimate the other side. Both Shakib Al Hasan and William Porterfield know that if their team loses this game, they can pretty much bid farewell to the quarter-finals, barring rare permutations of course. #p#Shakib said the game became more important for his side because they are expected to beat Ireland in home conditions. "This World Cup is a good chance for us to qualify for the second round, and if we have to qualify for the second round, we have to win this game," he said. "This is a very important game for us. It is a must-win situation, because if we don't it will be very difficult for us to qualify for the second round." #p#There has been talk that this is a grudge match for Bangladesh, having lost to Ireland in both the world events the sides have met in. Ireland won comprehensively in the 2007 World Cup and the 2009 World Twenty20. Shakib, though, chose not to focus on revenge but on how his side can make it to the next round. #p#Shakib knows, though, that spin will be the way to win. "When they played at Mirpur in 2008, we beat them three games in a row," Shakib said. "So we have the home advantage. I don't think they like to play in these conditions. Hopefully we will come off good in tomorrow's game. #p#"They have been playing good cricket, so we are not taking them lightly. They have been playing together for a long time, so that's a good sign for them. Some guys have been playing county cricket, so they will have the experience to deliver in this sort of pressure. So it won't be easy for us." #p#The big challenge for Ireland is that they don't have the surprise factor like they did in 2007. Teams will have analysed their strengths and weaknesses by now, which will make it that much more difficult for them to win regularly. "Now we have gained more exposure, we are playing more cricket," Porterfield said. "We have kind of put ourselves on the map in world cricket. We have come on since 2007. There is not much about our side that other sides won't know about. That itself brings extra pressure if you like. Definitely puts you in a different scenario, a different test. That's what you want. To test yourself against the best in the world." #p#Perhaps for the first time, Ireland will also be playing in front of a full house, 25,000 people shouting at the top of their voices. "I think there's a lot of people who will put them [Bangladesh] as favourites, and us as underdogs. That's to be expected in a lot of cases with sides playing away from home. We are going to play in front of a full house tomorrow. That brings extra pressure in itself." #p#Porterfield said the team has become more equipped to play spin since their 3-0 loss to Bangladesh in 2008. "I think not many lads had much exposure to the subcontinent at that time," he said. "We came out here, the conditions were pretty tough. We played those games in April, which was very hot, and the humidity was very tough. That's something we weren't quite expecting, and that took us slightly by surprise, in terms of how hard it was. Three years have passed. The experience we have gained since then is helpful. I think that we are lot better prepared this time."
9	502867	Bangladesh v Ireland, Group B, World Cup 2011, Mirpur	Ireland begin quest to prove they belong	Andrew Miller	February 24, 2011	Ireland exceeded expectations at the 2007 World Cup, but they face being blackballed from 2015 Associated Press Enlarge Related Links Matches: Bangladesh v Ireland at Dhaka Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Ireland #p#The chief executive of Cricket Ireland, Warren Deutrom, has told his players to focus solely on the challenge of competing on the world stage, starting with their opening fixture against Bangladesh on Friday, and let the administrators handle the wider issues surrounding Associates cricket, as the debate hots up about the proposed exclusion of non-Test teams from the 2015 World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. #p#Friday's match in Dhaka will be Ireland's first in World Cup cricket since their extraordinary performance in the Caribbean four years ago, in which they eliminated Pakistan in a thrilling three-wicket victory in the group stage in Jamaica, and qualified for the Super Eights where Bangladesh also fell victim to their team of talented part-timers. #p#The stakes, however, are rather higher four years on. Not only do Ireland come into this tournament with a reputation to uphold, they also know that they might not be invited back if they fail to at least match their efforts in 2007. As a direct result of the early elimination of India and Pakistan in that tournament, the 2011 format was changed to aid the progression of the top teams to the quarter-finals, and in 2015, the proposal is to do away with the Associates entirely and revert to a ten-team round-robin format. #p#Such a format would not do much to reduce the number of matches played in the World Cup - there would be at least 48 games in 2015, compared to 49 in 2011 and 51 in 2007 - but it would be expected to reduce the number of mismatches that have been a feature of the last two tournaments. The challenge for Ireland in the coming weeks is to demonstrate that they are a cut above the likes of Canada and Kenya, whose current teams - like Bermuda four years ago - have so far proved to be hopelessly out of their depth at this level. #p#"I've said to the players, don't worry that you are playing for our ODI future," Deutrom told ESPNcricinfo's Switch Hit podcast. "They have to go out and play for themselves and be naturally self-confident. I think a lot of the comments that the players have made over the last couple of weeks have been quite positive. We're not saying, 'yes we'll make the quarter-finals', but we are saying we are capable of making the quarter-finals if we perform to our potential." #p#The other Associate nation in Group B, the Netherlands, showed the tournament organisers exactly what they could be missing out in 2015, when they ran England excruciatingly close in their opening fixture in Nagpur on Tuesday. Their total of 292 for 6 left England needing to complete their second-highest run-chase in World Cup history to avoid humiliation, which they eventually managed with an uncomfortable eight balls to spare. #p#"It would be slightly unreasonable to expect the Associate nations to beat the likes of England, India, Australia or South Africa at a canter," said Deutrom. "What people want and the game wants are competitive fixtures, and what the Dutch showed is that perhaps the first few games weren't reflective of the skill that exists in the ICC's High Performance Programme." #p#However, the future of that programme - which also includes two further teams with ODI status, Scotland and Afghanistan - hangs in the balance in light of the ICC's plans for 2015, for it was last year's qualification tournament for the 2011 event that provided the main focus for the senior Associate nations. A meeting in Dubai prior to the World Cup produced more questions than answers, but at least a final decision on how to decide which ten teams take part in four years' time has been deferred until the end of the tournament. #p#"I think that is the right decision," said Deutrom. "What it does is allow the ICC board to make a decision based on all the evidence, rather than no evidence whatsoever. We are pleased because if two or three teams do perform well during the group stages, that does provide an option to look favourably on qualification, and to see if the number of teams is quite right." #p#Since their heroics in 2007, Ireland have used a combination of government funding, membership schemes and major events (including an annual fixture against England) to build an infrastructure around their team, professionalise their senior players, and push their claims to be considered for full international status - an ambition that remains Deutrom's ultimate goal. #p#However, even the most basic levels of administrative competence have been lacking from all too many of the other top-level Associates. The 2003 World Cup semi-finalists, Kenya, required ICC intervention in 2005 following long-standing allegations of corruption, while the failure of USA, Canada and Bermuda to build on their appearances in ICC events - dating back in Canada's case to the 1979 World Cup, has long been a source of frustration. #p#"I don't think we [the Associates] do ourselves any favours sometimes," said Deutrom. "With fewer human and economical resources, it's difficult for us all to be consistent at any one time, but if you look at the number of competitive ODI teams, it's more than just 10. #p#"An associate team has progressed at the last two 50-over World Cups, to the semi-finals and Super Eights respectively. Last year Ireland and Netherlands beat full-member opposition, and the current rankings reflect the fact that Ireland is tenth above Test opposition [Zimbabwe]. We face some major questions about where we go from here, but we certainly have no desire for the story to end here."

But the belief and unity of the Bangladeshis had to be seen to be believed, as they dusted themselves down after a chastising performance with the bat, and set about defending their meagre total with skill, tenacity and some sublime commitment in the field. <m13>Mohammad Ashraful, whose mercurial batting once again let him down</m13> when the heat was on, proved a revelation with the ball, as <m14>his spin-bowling all-sorts picked up two vital wickets inside the first 19 overs</m14>, and whose subsequent celebrations imbued both his team-mates - and perhaps more crucially, a rammed and expectant Mirpur crowd - with belief. #p#There will be many higher-profile fixtures than this in the coming weeks, but few could prove as pivotal to the fortunes of two teams who exceeded expectations four years ago in reaching the Super Eights in the Caribbean. Ireland's hopes of playing in the 2015 tournament hinge on their ability to produce this sort of performance in each of their next five matches, to convince the ICC that they deserve their place at the top table. But more immediately, <m15>Bangladesh's victory</m15> gives them a real chance of pushing for a quarter-final place that their form in home internationals suggests could be attainable. #p#After winning the toss and choosing to bat, Bangladesh started the match with the same aplomb with which they finished, bringing their fans to their feet in <m16>a thrilling first four overs</m16>, in which <m17>Tamim's blistering volley of strokeplay lifted the score to an imposing 41 for 0</m17>. However, Ireland are a more resourceful side than meets the eye, and the early decision to reduce the pace on the ball slowly but surely changed the tide of the contest. Trent Johnston and John Mooney drew the sting of the innings with their unrelenting line and length, but it was left to the teenaged spinner George Dockrell to inflict the telling blows. #p#<m18>Dockrell twirled straight through his ten overs, claiming 2 for 23 with a performance brimful of guile</m18>. His agonisingly slow pace through the air left all the batsmen groping in their defences, scared of taking on the long straight boundary for fear of being beaten in flight, and <m19>his two dismissals were carbon-copies of one another</m19> - a <m20>crease-bound Mushfiqur Rahim paddle-swept to Andrew White at short backward leg to end a doughty innings of 36</m20>, before <m21>Ashraful followed suit for 1 in the very next over</m21>. #p#Ireland's commitment in the field was unstinting. <m22>Ed Joyce and White pulled off a direct-hit run-out apiece, the first to remove Junaid Siddique for 3 - a dismissal which undermined Bangladesh's early momentum</m22> following <m23>the loss of the opener Imrul Kayes to an expert leg-side stumping from Niall O'Brien</m23> - <m24>and the latter to extract Raqibul Hasan for 38, at precisely the moment he looked set to guide the tail</m24> to a comfortable 200-plus total. But the <m25>one telling shortcoming was the performance of their quickest bowler, Boyd Rankin. His nine overs went for 62 - the most expensive analysis of the day - including a poor final over that went for 11.</m25> #p#Smart Stats. <m26>Bangladesh's 27-run win</m26> was their first over Ireland in World Cups and their fifth in seven matches against Ireland. Ireland had beaten Bangladesh by 74 runs in their previous meeting in World Cups. This was only the eighth win for Bangladesh in ODIs in Mirpur after batting first. They have lost on 13 occasions after batting first. <m27>Shafiul Islam's 4 for 21</m27> is the best bowling performance in World Cups by a Bangladesh bowler surpassing Abdur Razzak's 3 for 25 against South Africa in 2007. <m28>The fifty of the Bangladesh innings came up in just 5.4 overs</m28> which is the fastest time to a fifty for any team in this World Cup so far. #p#Pace off the ball was the secret on this deck, at least until such time as the Irish tail was exposed to Shafiul's old-ball wiles. He was given just the one over with the new ball in Ireland's innings, before Shakib turned to the <m29>spin pairing of Abdur Razzak and Naeem Islam</m29>. <m30>The tactic paid dividends in the sixth over of the innings, when Paul Stirling yorked himself while advancing to Razzak, and was stumped by Mushfiqur as the ball dribbled off the pads and past his off stump.</m30> #p#With the pressure intense in spite of the small target, Ireland's captain, Will Porterfield, set himself to make the most of every scoring opportunity. He had launched the innings in confident style with <m31>a second-ball drive off Shafiul through point</m31>, and <m32>he added a second four when Naeem dropped short at the end of his third over</m32>. But <m33>Shakib, Bangladesh's captain and senior spinner, struck with his first delivery, as Porterfield attempted a flick off the back foot, and instead popped a simple catch to Raqibul at short midwicket.</m33> #p#<m34>O'Brien, however, was the right man to enter the fray. He was the hero of a tense run-chase in Jamaica four years ago, when Ireland stunned Pakistan in the 2007 World Cup, and two fours in the same Shakib over were the perfect tonic for his team's frayed nerves.</m34> <m35>In partnership with the England veteran, Joyce</m35>, he picked off the singles and gnawed away at the target, before <m36>Joyce, on 16, attempted to drive against the spin, and popped a simple chance to Ashraful</m36>. #p#Ashraful celebrated as if the match was already won, which it self-evidently was not at <m37>75 for 3 in the 19th over</m37>. However, the belief in the Bangladesh team was picked up on by the crowd, and the roof was raised six overs later, when <m38>White, on 10, played a lazy pushed drive from deep in the crease to be bowled through the gate</m38>. #p#It was a dismissal that increased the Irish jitters ten-fold, but it was nothing compared to <m39>the dismissal of O'Brien three overs later. With a rock-solid 38 from 52 balls to his name, he was tempted to put too much bat through a lofted clip into the leg side, and Tamim at deep square leg hurtled in to snaffle a brilliant low catch inches from the turf.</m39> <m40>At 110 for 5, Bangladesh were right back in the contest</m40> and O'Brien's self-recriminations were revealing. With an asking-rate of four an over, there was simply no need for such risks. #p#His brother Kevin, however, chose his big shots more judiciously - at least at first. <m41>An up-and-under six over long-on</m41> was the first and only maximum of the match, and <m42>he added two more kitchen-sink clumps in Ashraful's ninth and final over, which went for 14</m42>. But <m43>at 151 for 5 in the 37th over</m43>, when all that was required was a cool head and an exchange of singles, <m44>O'Brien was suckered by Shafiul's short ball, and launched a pull straight to the substitute, Suhrawadi Shuvo, at square leg</m44>. #p#From that moment on, Ireland's hopes began to evaporate. <m45>Naeem nailed Mooney for an eight-ball duck, as he tried a flat-footed cut but edged into his stumps</m45>, and <m46>three balls later, the obdurate Andre Botha played all round a full-length delivery that crashed into his leg stump</m46>. <m47>With Shafiul on a roll, surfing the crowd's delirium and zipping the ball at pace from a full length</m47>, the tail were unable to resist. Bangladesh's World Cup campaign is up and running. Ireland's, despite their best endeavours, must start all over again against England next week. #p#Match Timeline

Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Matches: Bangladesh v Ireland at Dhaka Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Bangladesh | Ireland #p#The flag. The cricket World Cups - both the 50-over and Twenty20 kinds - have this ridiculous fetish for creating nationalistic fervour wherein first the national flags are paraded with Conquest of Paradise playing full blast, and then the national anthems are belted out. Sometimes, as it happened with South Africa, the anthems are rendered poorly, and cut midway. It was good to see then that Ireland sent out not their national flag, but the Cricket Ireland one. #p#The stumping. Was it planned? After Bangladesh got off to a flying start, John Mooney brought some sanity by taking the pace off the ball. <m2>The turning point came when he bowled down the leg side, close enough to Imrul Kayes to invite a flick, but wide enough to miss his bat. And Niall O'Brien was sensational behind the stumps. It needed just a brief moment of overbalancing from Kayes, and the bails were off</m2>. #p#The run-out, and the reaction. <m3>In the ninth over of the Bangladesh innings, Junaid Siddique tried to steal a single to mid-off, and Ed Joyce ran in sharply and hit the stumps with an underarm flick. His immediate reaction was to shake his head; it seemed the batsman was in. Nevertheless the third umpire was called up. The first replay seemed to suggest Joyce's instinct was correct. The fielders went back to their marks. The TV umpire, though, slowed it down real nice, and the later replays found the bat just short. At that moment, the crowd was cheering, the fielders were at the boundary. Suddenly they ran in, suddenly the crowd was stunned.</m3> #p#The gifts. It was like Christmas had arrived already. <m4>Boyd Rankin, looking the least effective of the Irish bowlers, bowled short and wide often.</m4> This one time, though, <m5>Shakib Al Hasan thought of a return gift, and cut it straight to point. William Porterfield, the other captain on the field, showed more generosity, dropping a sitter</m5> by Irish standards. Then again, when it comes to generosity, the hosts should have the final say in the subcontinent. <m6>In the next over, Shakib went hard at a short ball again, offering Andre Botha a return catch</m6>. #p#The song. The PA man at the Shere Bangla Stadium must think that Coldplay are an Irish band, for every time Ireland took a wicket, all you could hear was the same Coldplay song repeated over and over again. When <m7>Tamim Iqbal fell to a forgettable shot after a threatening 44</m7>, Viva La Vida became the poignant moment of the day. "  And that was when I ruled the world." #p#The confusion. Well now that the UDRS is upon us to save the world from bad decisions, how about some common sense? <m8>In the 47th over of Bangladesh's innings, umpire Rod Tucker ruled Abdur Razzak out lbw, but the batsman successfully challenged the decision. The confusion starts here, though. The ball had gone for what would have been four leg-byes fine of a square third man, who would have had little chance of fielding it had the on-field umpire not given the batsman out. However, those leg-byes didn't count, but the ball did.</m8> And the rule clearly states so too. However, it is a departure from the tennis model, which the UDRS advocates often bring up. In similar situations in tennis, the point is replayed. Those four runs could still go on to become crucial if this is a tight chase.
9	503047	Bangladesh v Ireland, World Cup 2011, Group B, Mirpur	Tigers let themselves roar	Sidharth Monga in Mirpur	February 25, 2011	#p#Press conferences in today's media-trained sport don't usually give much of an insight into the players' mindset. There's generally too much of 'the right areas' and 'playing the ball on its merits'. For the last two weeks or so, Shakib Al Hasan, Bangladesh's young captain, tactically not one of the best going around but a brave man for his age, has been trying to cover himself in a veil of dispassion. All his press conferences in the build-up to the World Cup - its first match, its first match's aftermath, its second match - have been all about disciplines and basics and the like. #p#After <m1>they finally won one game</m1>, however, Shakib, and his two team-mates, Tamim Iqbal and Shafiul Islam, lifted that veil. Minutes after they had gone on a victory lap - yes, <m2>after having beaten Ireland</m2> - the three came to address the media. Shakib being the captain, Tamim inexplicably being Man of the Match, and Shafiul because Tamim and Shakib thought he should have been Man of the Match. #p#Shakib's answers today went past two lines for the first time in the last two weeks. Tamim, like a back-bencher in a class, hid behind an energy-drink bottle and kept making fun of whatever he was making fun of. Whenever one person answered a question, the other two would be busy whispering jokes to each other. The national cricketers were back to being kids again; they aren't too much older in reality, either. Many jokes were cracked in Bangla in those 20 minutes. This press conference, the victory lap, said a lot about the release they felt. #p#"It wasn't really a victory lap," Shakib said. "Just showed our feelings. They [the people] have supported us throughout the two matches. Even the time we come for practice, people are on the streets. They just wait for us and wish us good luck. I thought it was our responsibility to show some respect to them as well." #p#More than respect and feelings, Bangladesh now knew they could show people their faces. That will be a big relief for a group that can't be the best team to support: they give up chases once Tamim gets out, and they often bat first without plan or brains. Yet they have had this unimaginably crazy support for the last two weeks. #p#And then there has been pressure of having made unpopular and stern, but well-meaning, decisions. It's no secret that the team management has put its foot down in leaving Mashrafe Mortaza out of the side for the World Cup, because of his fitness problems, against the wishes of those in the board who like to use the popular sentiment. Then they dropped Mohammad Ashraful, again the galleries' hero who disappoints much too often, for the first game. These are not decisions typical of Bangladesh cricket. The other day Shakib was asked in a press conference, "It seems you don't like seniors. Why?" #p#All that, combined with the beyond-saturation coverage of the World Cup on TV and in newspapers, plays on players' minds. When you have a game like Bangladesh had against India - don't be fooled by the 283 runs they scored, not for one ball did they look like they were competing - you perhaps start thinking of repercussions too. Repercussions, should you not do well, happen in the subcontinent at the end of every World Cup. #p#A lot was pent up coming into this game against Ireland. The kids had looked old and rugged against India. They badly needed to express themselves, there had been too much of right areas, the Bangladeshi cricketers needed to let themselves go. Out came a trigger-happy batting side. All they managed was mindless cricket. It reminded you of what Dav Whatmore said of their cricket when he left them four years ago. #p#"The lack of basic knowledge is a bit staggering really," Whatmore had said then. "When these young cricketers were growing up in youth cricket, they weren't told about the basics of cricket." They were at it again. When they knew 250 would be a daunting total on this slow and low track, they kept getting out to adventurous shots, worst of them being sweeps from well outside off, against the turn of a left-arm spinner. Whether it was pressure or lack of cricketing sense, this was the crazy Bangladesh we know: one-fifths individual brilliance, four-fifths collective implosion. #p#In their defence, though, they came out a brave side. That's their strength. When they have team-mates by their side, when they can let their army of spinners apply a choke hold to the opposition, when most importantly they have 25,000 behind them in the stadium, and many more thousands waiting outside. #p#They dived, they caught, they bowled stump to stump. They celebrated every Ireland wicket - batsmen with little experience of playing on low and slow tracks - as if they had just claimed Ricky Ponting, Sachin Tendulkar and Brian Lara. <m3>Ashraful, who by his own standards managed a stunningly poor shot to get out for 1</m3>, reacted as if he had scored a goal in a World Cup final when <m4>he dismissed Andrew White</m4>, who didn't look at home against spin bowling of any kind. #p#It might have put neutrals off, but Bangladesh needed to let it out. Defeat to Ireland would have crushed them. The tension was getting released with every step they took towards a first win. It culminated in that victory lap - not really a victory lap, Shakib will point out. Now that they have bitten this bullet, they should not be so muddled in their heads in the coming games, but if their batsmen are as suicidal as they were today, they will find teams who are not as obliging as Ireland were.
9	503050	Bangladesh v Ireland, World Cup 2011, Group B, Mirpur	Porterfield rues batting lapses	Sidharth Monga in Mirpur	February 25, 2011	#p#They get their big chance once every four years, but Ireland won the hearts once again with a spirited show in the field. However, they couldn't win a game that they ought to have secured with plenty to spare. Not many sides come back from <m1>the hammering Tamim Iqbal dished out in the first half hour of the game</m1>, but Ireland did so through intelligent bowling and energetic fielding. However, their batting didn't quite have the wits their effort in the field had shown. #p#It took Ireland four overs to realise that they would need to take the pace off on this surface, and Boyd Rankin's pace would prove to be his enemy. They did so with their imitation of New Zealand's famous dibbly-dobblies. Andre Botha, John Mooney and Trent Johnston kept bowling accurately, kept rolling their fingers either side of the ball every now and then, and the fielders supported them superbly. #p#With the bat, however, Ireland were as frozen as they were free-flowing in the field. Until <m2>Shafiul Islam came back to mow down the last four off with a devastating spell of reverse-swing</m2>, hardly any batsmen fell to a wicket-taking delivery, and that's what should irk an honest side like Ireland. At any rate, their opportunities on the world stage are so limited, chasing 206 in the subcontinent is not a chance they should be wasting. #p#<m3>Ireland's captain William Porterfield was the first to take the blame. He chipped the first delivery bowled by Shakib Al Hasan to short midwicket.</m3> "I played a poor shot. I was as frustrated as I have been in a while," he said. "You can't afford to do things like that in any cricket, let alone major tournaments. I let myself down, I let my team down in the way I got out. Regardless we should have knocked those runs off. We should have taken more responsibilities." #p#What will be doubly frustrating is that Ireland's best bets in the middle order, the O'Brien brothers, got off to starts, but holed out in the deep. If either one of them had doubled his score in the high 30s, Ireland would have been through comfortably. They came that close. And both looked good to do exactly that. Especially Niall O'Brien, who looked the best batsman of the day, reading the spinners' lengths early, moving his feet decisively, and finding gaps instinctively. That instinct failed him when <m4>he went a bit too hard at a chip shot.</m4> It becomes that much more poignant when you think how <m5>it was Niall O'Brien who started Ireland's turnaround in the first place, with a flashy, inspirational stumping down the leg side to dispatch Imrul Kayes</m5>. #p#Porterfield said it should never have been a case of "so near, yet so far" It shouldn't have even been close, in his opinion. "If you ask Shakib [Al Hasan], he would say they won it, the way they came out fighting. I think they did that. [However] If we ask ourselves, we should chase 200 against any team in this tournament in any conditions. I think we'll say we lost it, they might say they won it. #p#"We were never going to struggle to get four an over in 50 overs, but if you get bowled out you are not going to win games," he added. "We just kept losing wickets. Anytime we looked like we had a partnership going, we lost wickets. You can't afford to do that at any level." #p#A measure of Ireland's inexperience at the highest level is that this was the first time they were playing a day-night ODI, and perhaps the first time they came up against such an imposing crowd. However, Porterfield said that the crowd didn't play any role in their capitulation with the bat. "I actually enjoyed the atmosphere," he said. "That's what you want to play in front of. You want to play in front of packed houses. And fanatical fans, like Bangladesh has. I don't think it had any effect whatsoever. If you turn up at a stadium and find a full house, if you can't get yourself up for a game, then there is something wrong with you. In my opinion, the crowd didn't really have an effect." #p#It can be a demoralising way to lose, but Porterfield said his side was capable of leaving what happened in Dhaka in Dhaka. "There were a few poor shots in there," he said. "We will take a look at ourselves. The way we have been playing, the two warm-up games, the preparations we have had, we have let ourselves down a bit. [But] If we play the way we have been playing over the last couple of weeks, then I don't think we will have major issues going forward."

AFP Enlarge Related Links Report : Misbah and Afridi sink Sri Lanka Preview : Heavyweights clash at R Premadasa News : Pakistan mull three specialist bowlers News : Sri Lanka wary of "dangerous" Pakistan Matches: Sri Lanka v Pakistan at Colombo (RPS) Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Pakistan | Sri Lanka #p#There must be a certain comfort for Pakistan in taking on Sri Lanka. This has nothing to do with who is the better side, but on the grounds of familiarity alone. In the last five years, when Pakistan haven't known anything about their future on and off the field, they've always known that soon, they'll be playing against Sri Lanka. #p#When looking to introduce a new captain, they look to Sri Lanka, as they did with Shoaib Malik and a three-ODI series in Abu Dhabi just after the last World Cup. In the interests of symmetry they even ended Malik's captaincy two years later just after he had lost another three-match series against them. The first international Pakistan played after the Oval Test forfeit and the positive dope tests of Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammad Asif was against Sri Lanka. The most joyous occasions, such as the World Twenty20 win have involved Sri Lanka. The saddest, the Lahore attacks just before, have also regrettably involved them. #p#No country has played more against Pakistan in the last five years across all three formats than Sri Lanka (30 games). In a recent board-to-board interchange, both chairmen referred to the other in "brotherly" terms. It was a pointless exchange about Sri Lanka's scheduled series against Pakistan in October this year and the remote possibility of it being played in Pakistan. But if and when international cricket does return, it can be easily imagined that Sri Lanka will be the first visitors. #p#In many ways, the rivalry has been a balm, a soothing one, for Pakistan. #p#Lately, quietly slipping in under the radar of traditional duels, it has become an intense one. In the vernacular, you might even say it has acquired kaanta , or needle. In 17 ODIs since January 2006, the sides have won eight games each. None of the games have been particularly close but as a whole, contests have been competitive and carried meaningful sub-plots. #p#"I think Pakistan is a great side, they've got great balance, they've got match winning cricketers, not just one but quite a lot of them, so any opposition is wary of them," Kumar Sangakkara, Sri Lanka's captain, said. "We are not going to take anything lightly or for granted, we are just going to go out there and do the best what we can." #p#Sangakkara, who contributed to the needle with a much-remembered slanging match with Younis Khan in 2009, speaks from a position of equality, if not outright control. The equality is a modern attribute, since Sri Lanka's rise from 1996. Pakistan may well have won six out of six World Cup encounters before Saturday, but - and this is remarkable - they haven't come across each other since 1992. #p#The stat means nothing. Altogether more relevant is the run-in: Sri Lanka have won six of the last eight. #p#Familiarity, in fact, may be the winning and losing of it. Pakistan, over the years, have learnt not to give wickets to Muttiah Muralitharan; he's taken 95 in 64 ODIs, but they rarely crumble to him. Even then, Waqar Younis' bullish assessment, that Muralitharan "isn't 28 anymore" and that the going may not be easy for him, tempts fate. Similarly, Lasith Malinga, not a certainty, has not been as difficult to fathom as others have found. #p#And arguably, they were the first country to decode Ajantha Mendis. #p#"We've played a lot of cricket against them and understand each other's games well," Misbah-ul-Haq said. "Both Muralitharan and Malinga are world class. But we've played them quite a lot, and players understand their strengths. Simple plan: play them on merit." #p#Instead, it is men such as Nuwan Kulusekera or even Rangana Herath if he plays, the more orthodox if you will, of Sri Lanka's stars who have troubled Pakistan consistently. If Pakistan can shed their caution and attach another specialist bowler, their attack will be deceptively incisive. Regardless, we are assured of the presence of a vast, varied cast of match-winners on the field tomorrow, any of them capable of changing a game in a blink. #p#For the World Cup, the R Premadasa has taken on a new visage. A day before the game, and empty, it still looked faintly intimidating, even threatening. The stands are new and high. The game is sold-out. The city is feeling it now, building up to it. The weekend is here. Both teams are wound up, ready to be let at each other. It will be some atmosphere, a true theatre for what will be - hopefully, given the lack of them so far - a true contest.
10	502981	Sri Lanka v Pakistan, Group A, World Cup 2011, Colombo	Pakistan mull three specialist bowlers	Osman Samiuddin in Colombo	February 25, 2011	#p#If indications from Waqar Younis are anything to go by, Pakistan are unlikely to pick a fourth specialist bowler for Saturday's crunch game against co-hosts Sri Lanka at the R Premadasa. Pakistan comprehensively beat Kenya in their tournament opener on Wednesday, but played, in Umar Gul, Shoaib Akhtar and Abdur Rehman, with just three specialist bowlers. Shahid Afridi is as good as a specialist bowler but the caution to fill the line-up with batsmen and batsmen who can bowl, has led to an under-utilisation of Abdul Razzaq. #p#Razzaq batted at No. 8 in the last game, as he has done in 14 of 18 ODIs in the last year. He has played a few significant innings but more than his performances, the question has been whether he is being allowed, in the current line-up, to have the fullest impact on a game. Pakistan have compensated by using him as an opening bowler, but even there he remains under-used: in those 18 ODIs, he has bowled 91.4 overs or, on average, roughly five overs a game. Never once has he bowled the whole quota and he has picked up eight wickets. #p#Instead, Pakistan have combined him and Mohammad Hafeez to provide a fifth bowler and have also been making Ahmed Shehzad bowl in practice, with a view to using him if needed. Though Waqar admitted that Razzaq didn't "really fit" in the current line-up, he maintained that they were happy with his bowling contribution. #p#"I think Razzaq has done really well with the ball," Waqar said, ahead of the Sri Lanka game. "He hasn't delivered the goods with the bat apart from one game in Abu Dhabi [the hundred against South Africa]. He is no doubt our striker in both batting and bowling. He bowls with the new ball and we've got to push him a little more in that. #p#"You're right he comes at eight, but we have five batsmen, the keeper is more a batsman and then there is Afridi, so he doesn't really fit in at the moment. But if we need to send him up the order if quick runs are required we might push him." #p#Pakistan's batting, in actual fact, has performed well over that period, crossing 250 13 times in their last 20 ODIs. But clearly the management remains concerned. The inclusion of Abdur Rehman ahead of Saeed Ajmal - circumstantial to an extent after a personal tragedy forced Ajmal to return to Pakistan during the New Zealand tour and allowed Rehman to take his place - against Kenya surprised some. But it has been done to shore the batting up further still. #p#"It is unfortunate Ajmal is not playing right now," Waqar said. "He has won matches for us over the last 4-5 years. But right now Rehman is a utility player. He bats a little, he is a very good fielder and the way he is bowling, from what I've seen, he is the best spinner here." #p#For the moment, Waqar said, the final XI had not been decided and hints from the camp suggest it is likely to remain unchanged. But the nature of the surface, re-laid recently, might compel a re-jig. "We don't really know at the moment," Waqar said. "These pitches are brand new, so we're not really sure how it has played. We're just going to go with the best combination, what we probably had in the last match but we haven't had a meeting yet. Until we come back in the morning and see something different, but at the moment I don't think there will be changes." #p#Though Waqar played down the threat Muttiah Muralitharan might pose, he acknowledged Sri Lanka will be a stern test. "It's an important game. For this tournament, for momentum it is important and to get to the quarter-final, and in which position you get there, in that sense very important. If you want to go ahead, you have to build momentum so you treat all the teams as one. Sri Lanka at home is very difficult to beat. But the way we've played and trained, I am hopeful we can beat them."

Both Pakistan and Sri Lanka opened with massive wins over Associate nations, but this will be their first real test in the competition. None of the smaller teams in Group A seem capable of challenging the Test nations, so the game will be important in terms of placings for the quarter-finals. And in a tournament whose first week has been loaded with one-sided matches, two teams packed with dynamic players also promise some high-voltage entertainment. #p#Past records might suggest Pakistan have an edge - they have beaten Sri Lanka in each of their six encounters in the World Cups and have won their previous five games at the R Premadasa - but that will count for little. The two sides have not faced each other in cricket's showpiece tournament since 1992, and the Premadasa has undergone extensive redevelopment. What will help Pakistan, though, is the relative lack of controversy surrounding the current team, a low-profile lead-up and the confidence of a recent series win, in New Zealand, behind them. #p#Sri Lanka's advantage is that most of their players have had a taste of how the new track will fare during the domestic limited-over tournament held in January. Traditionally, this has been a bat-first venue, especially in day-night games where the team chasing has won only one of the past 13 matches, but it remains to be seen how the re-laid pitch fares. #p#Form guide (Most recent first) Sri Lanka WWWLW Pakistan WLWWW #p#Pitch and conditions The pitch will be the centre of attention since it's a re-laid track, and Saturday's game will be the first international game to be played on it. It may not be too high scoring a game, if the domestic matches played since the stadium was re-developed are anything to go by. The highest score batting first in the one-dayers played in January was 225, a total which was easily defended. Kumar Sangakkara, the Sri Lanka captain, though, expects the bare surface to be good for batting. #p#Watch out for  Thisara Perera was outstanding with the ball against Canada, and picked loads of wickets whenever he got a chance in 2010 as well. He worked up real pace in Hambantota, and has provided the team management with the welcome headache of working out how to accommodate him, Lasith Malinga, Nuwan Kulasekara and Angelo Mathews in the XI. He also adds muscle to Sri Lanka's lower-middle order. #p#Shoaib Akhtar has weathered stacks of controversies and fitness problems to become one of the few constants in Pakistan's team. There has not been any talk of injuries for eight months, a minor miracle given his past record. Age hasn't slowed him down too much either; even at 35 he remains among the quickest bowlers in the world. #p#Team news Pakistan have hinted they will stick to the same combination that played Kenya, which means Wahab Riaz and Saeed Ajmal are likely to remain on the bench. Waqar Younis has said Pakistan are pondering how to use Abdul Razzaq better, but for now he will continue to be an impact batsman at No. 8 and opening the bowling. #p#Pakistan (probable): 1 Mohammad Hafeez, 2 Ahmed Shehzad, 3 Kamran Akmal (wk), 4 Younis Khan, 5 Misbah-ul-Haq, 6 Umar Akmal, 7 Shahid Afridi (capt), 8 Abdul Razzaq, 9 Umar Gul, 10 Abdur Rehman, 11 Shoaib Akhtar #p#The main concern for Sri Lanka is the fitness of their pace spearhead, Malinga, who has a back strain. He missed Sri Lanka's opening game, but he did bowl in the nets on Friday. The physio will take a call on Saturday whether Malinga will play. If he doesn't, Sri Lanka could stick to the same XI that beat Canada. #p#Sri Lanka (probable): 1 Tillakaratne Dilshan, 2 Upul Tharanga, 3 Kumar Sangakkara (capt & wk), 4 Mahela Jayawardene, 5 Chamara Kapugedera, 6 Thilan Samaraweera, 7 Angelo Mathews, 8 Thisara Perera, 9 Nuwan Kulasekara, 10 Ajantha Mendis, 11 Muttiah Muralitharan #p#Try picking the XIs for tomorrow's game by playing Team Selector. #p#Stats and trivia #p#Muttiah Muralitharan needs one more wicket to move past Wasim Akram's tally of 55 wickets to become the second highest wicket-taker in World Cups. #p#Sri Lanka have never beaten Pakistan in six World Cup matches, though the two haven't met in the competition since 1992. #p#One more stumping will take Sangakkara's tally to eight, moving ahead of Adam Gilchrist and Moin Khan, with whom he current shares the record for most stumpings. #p#This is Afridi's fourth World Cup, but he is yet to make a half-century. #p#Quotes #p#"In the past we've played really well against him in this country.

10	503043	Sri Lanka v Pakistan, Group A, World Cup 2011, Colombo	Sri Lanka wary of "dangerous" Pakistan	Sa'adi Thawfeeq in Colombo	February 25, 2011	#p#Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene, Sri Lanka's captain and vice-captain respectively, have both warned that Pakistan are a dangerous side that other teams will be wary of in the World Cup. Not too many people have tipped Pakistan to win the tournament, after a tumultuous year for them in which they have been plagued by off-field issues, but Jayawardene said he was surprised by the lack of hype around them. #p#"I find it surprising that their name is not bandied about in the mix of potential World Cup winners as they have brilliant match winners with both bat and ball," Jayawardene wrote on his blog. #p#Sangakkara echoed that sentiment, saying Pakistan's batsmen were dangerous. "Any opposition is wary of them and we're not going to take anything lightly or for granted," he said. He was, however, confident that his bowlers would be up to the task, particularly with what he described as a "vastly improved" pace attack. Lasith Malinga has been Sri Lanka's most successful bowler in the one-day format over the past year, and Thisara Perera, who seemed to have added a couple of yards of pace to his bowling in Sri Lanka's opening match against Canada, has been the second highest wicket-taker. #p#"We understand how dangerous the Pakistani batsmen are and that's the beauty of playing a side like them," Sangakkara said. "Those challenges I think the bowlers will enjoy. There's been a vast improvement for us actually to have good fast bowlers in our squad. We've got guys who bowl over 140[kph] and we've got guys who swing it as well. Both sides have good pace and good spin and I think it's going to be a battle between two teams who are looking forward to a very keen contest. Every side has a different approach and we've got our own, which we're trying to fine tune as we go along. " #p#Sri Lanka, along with co-hosts India, are being touted as one of the favourites to win the World Cup, but Jayawardene said even though Pakistan may not be hosting any games, they still know the conditions well. "Pakistan are just as familiar with the conditions, so they pose a huge danger to any side, especially in the knockout stage and it should be a good match," he said. "Despite what people may write or not write, we certainly are fully aware of what this Pakistan side can do to any team with seemingly little effort." #p#One possible setback for Sri Lanka is that there are still doubts over the readiness of Malinga for the game. He missed the match against Canada with a back strain, though Perera and Nuwan Kulasekara did the job in his absence. #p#"Lasith is improving very fast and we'll have to look at him," Sangakkara said. "We don't want to rush him into a big tournament like this. He is the most important player for us so we want to make sure that he is comfortable and everyone is comfortable with the decision." #p#The pitch at the R Premadasa has been completely re-laid ahead of the World Cup, but Sri Lanka's players have the advantage of having played on it during the domestic one-day tournament in January. Sangakkara, who praised the new pitch in Hambantota, said he thought the wicket in Colombo would be as good for batting. "In the match against Canada the wicket was good and we think even this surface will act the same," he said. "We don't' want to think too much about the pitch."

Matches: Sri Lanka v Pakistan at Colombo (RPS) Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Pakistan | Sri Lanka #p#Anyone out there who still thinks Pakistan are not dangerous contenders for the World Cup? With tremendous poise and skill in the middle overs, <m7>Misbah-ul-Haq and Younis Khan propelled Pakistan</m7>, who were on <m8>a tricky 105 for 2 in the 21st over</m8>, to <m9>a strong 277</m9>, before <m10>Shahid Afridi and Shoaib Akthar produced bits of magic to derail the chase</m10>. <m11>Chamara Silva threatened to pull off a thrilling heist with a flurry of boundaries</m11>, and <m12>Nuwan Kulasekara made one heroic last-ditch effort to reduce the equation to 18 runs from the final over</m12>. <m13>Umar Gul, however, held his nerve to steer Pakistan home and end a mesmeric exhibition of high-quality cricket in Colombo</m13> #p#Pakistan's innings had everything: rapid start, brain fade, tranquil middle overs, <m14>fabulous end-over bowling from Muttiah Muralitharan, who gave only five runs from two batting Powerplay overs</m14>, and finally <m15>a Misbah blitz, with 32 runs flowing from the final three overs</m15>, which eventually made the difference. #p#The chase too nearly had it all: two inspired moments bursting with imagination and skill from Shoaib and Afridi, <m16>two failed stumpings</m16>, <m17>a dropped catch</m17> and a late surge from Silva, who woke up too late after a painstaking start. #p#<m18>In the 21st over, Shoaib produced a crafty offcutter, slightly slower and darting in from outside off, to breach the defences of Mahela Jayawardene</m18> and leave <m19>Sri Lanka stuttering at 95 for 3</m19>. In the next, <m20>Afridi, who had earlier removed Tillakaratne Dilshan with a skidding delivery</m20>, <m21>ripped a loopy leg break that dipped rapidly on Thilan Samaraweera, who was sucked out of his crease and left stranded as Kamran Akmal effected a smart stumping</m21>. <m22>Akmal later missed two leg-side stumping chances to let off Kumar Sangakkara, on 22 and 33, off Abdur Rehman.</m22> <m23>The first one kicked more than Akmal anticipated</m23> and <m24>he had no excuse for the second</m24>. <m25>Rehman, himself, dropped a sitter to reprieve Silva</m25>. However, the twin blows had left Sangakkara with too much to do, especially with Silva struggling to get started, and <m26>he fell by holing out to long-on</m26>. Silva then stirred from his slumber to reduce the equation from <m27>88 from 47 balls</m27> to <m28>46 from 24</m28>. <m29>He slog swept Rehman for two fours and pulled Gul and Shoaib for more boundaries</m29> before <m30>he was stumped</m30>. <m31>Kulasekara took over the baton, whipping a 14-ball 24</m31> but the task proved beyond him. #p#It was the batting that set up the game for Pakistan, as the Premadasa has always been cruel to the team batting second. Pakistan's innings stood out for its handling of the middle overs. Serenity blew across the ground after <m32>the fall of Kamran</m32>. <m33>Mohammad Hafeez had run himself out after a moment of madness</m33> and <m34>Kamran, who inexplicably withdrew into his shell after that mix-up, soon combusted, going for an ugly slog against Pakistan's bogeyman Rangana Herath</m34>. It wasn't quite a crisis but it definitely needed calm heads. Luckily for Pakistan, you can't find better men than <m35>Misbah and Younis to handle these moments</m35>. What followed was a perfect advertisement for the much-abused middle overs in an ODI. #p#<m36>Two of the oldest members of the side ran beautifully, worked the angles intelligently, pinged the gaps frequently with the nudge-drive-and-sweep routine, and breathed life into an innings that could have, perhaps otherwise, succumbed to adrenalin rushes. If Misbah pressed back to play Murali, Younis leaned forward to tackle him; if Misbah backed to leg to create room, Younis shuffled to off to work to the leg; if Misbah tapped wide of midwicket for the quick single, Younis nudged just wide of backward point; if Misbah deployed the reverse-sweep, Younis stayed conventional.</m36> They always ran well. The runs kept ticking over, the opposition grew increasingly restless, and Pakistan secured ownership of the innings. #p#What further spiced up this partnership was the knowledge that the powerful lower order was waiting in the dressing room. When <m37>Younis fell in the 41st over</m37>, with <m38>Pakistan on 213 for 4</m38>, it even seemed like good news for Pakistan - Afridi and co to follow, unleash violence and 300 would be a formality. Or so it seemed. Here is where Sri Lanka sparkled. Here is when that man Murali and Kulasekara stepped in to do damage control. #p#While Pakistan's handling of middle overs was a treat to watch, Sri Lanka's skill in the end overs was awe-inspiring. <m39>Murali ripped his offbreaks, altering the trajectory, pace, and the extent of turn.</m39> <m40>Kulasekara punctuated his yorkers with slower cutters to keep Pakistan in check</m40>. <m41>Murali gave only two runs in the 44th over</m41>, the first of <m42>the batting Powerplay</m42>, and <m43>only three in the 46th</m43>, which included <m44>the wicket of Umar Akmal</m44>. <m45>Kulasekera gave away just five in the 47th</m45>, keeping Afridi quiet with a series of yorkers. #p#<m46>Misbah responded to Murali's magic by growing more innovative. He shuffled to the off and whipped Thisara Perera and Angelo Mathews for boundaries as Pakistan collected 32 runs in the last three overs to post a match-winning total.</m46> Misbah and Younis' presence in the middle overs had raised a few murmurs before this World Cup but there would be only voices of appreciation after tonight. #p#Match Timeline
10	503227	Sri Lanka v Pakistan, World Cup 2011, Group A, Colombo	Kamran Akmal sees red and old legs make hay	Osman Samiuddin in Colombo	February 26, 2011	Shoaib Akhtar is still alive and kicking. Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: Kamran Akmal | Kumar Sangakkara | Shoaib Akhtar Matches: Sri Lanka v Pakistan at Colombo (RPS) Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Pakistan | Sri Lanka #p#Comedy skit of the day. Somehow, <m1>Mohammad Hafeez was run-out</m1> - that is the punchline. The build-up to it was pure slapstick. <m2>First there was Kamran Akmal charging down the pitch, with possible justification, for a single to short fine leg. Hafeez didn't run, so they were both at the striker's end with the ball now back to the wicketkeeper. Akmal started walking off, but Kumar Sangakkara's throw was wild, nowhere near the stumps or anyone and Akmal, had he known it, probably could have made it back. Somehow the ball found its way to someone who wasn't falling apart and some bails were taken off somewhere.</m2> #p#Slip of the day. Or rather, the one that wasn't there: Kumar Sangakkara strangely began the match with only one slip. <m3>In the second over Ahmed Shehzad flashed at Thisara Perera and edged it for four, straight past where second slip should've been.</m3> Sangakkara immediately put one in place the next ball, though next over he was back down to one. #p#Action replay of the day. Left-arm spinners are to Kamran Akmal what red rags are to bulls. In Pakistan's opening game against Kenya, a well-set Akmal suddenly decided to charge down the pitch to Shem Ngoche, an ugly wild heave as close to the ball as China is to the US. He was well-set again at the R Premadasa when the introduction of Rangana Herath suddenly brought down the red mist. Out he charged and out he walked, even further from this ball than he was in Hambantota. #p#Freshest legs of the day. The <m4>partnership between Misbah-ul-Haq and Younis Khan</m4> was the key one for Pakistan. <m5>The pair put on 108 runs, at almost a run-a-ball through the middle of the innings and there were hardly any boundaries in it. Instead, at the combined age of 68 years, the pair gave an absolute masterclass in middle overs running. They began by taking the easy singles, but soon began to pinch audacious ones hit straight to fielders. And as the stand grew, there was the deftest placement for a number of doubles between square leg and deep midwicket. In all there were 65 singles and ten doubles.</m5> #p#Wicket of the day. Thirty-five years old, a near-permanent limp and a more colourful past than Charlie Sheen, yet somehow Shoaib Akhtar is alive and kicking it at the World Cup. Each over leaves him looking like a boxer who's just finished ten rounds, yet in he runs again for another, consistently quick, over. He bowled without luck against Kenya and seemed to be going the same way here. Then, <m6>in his second spell he trundled in to Mahela Jayawardene and suddenly knocked back his middle stump with an in-dipper.</m6> As a spectacle, nothing beats it still. #p#Worst audition for Stumpy the tournament mascot of the day. <m7>The first leg-side stumping Kamran Akmal missed of Kumar Sangakkara was understandable</m7>, though better wicketkeepers would've pouched it. But <m8>the second miss, off the bowling of Abdur Rehman again, was a true Akmal clanger; Sangakkara was miles out, the ball wasn't even that far down the leg-side and Akmal knocked the bails off swiftly enough. He just didn't have the ball with him.</m8> #p#Pre-match prophecy of the day. "He bats a little, he is a very good fielder and the way he is bowling, from what I've seen, he is the best spinner here." After <m9>the Chamara Silva drop</m9>, please note Abdur Rehman's second quality that Waqar Younis, Pakistan coach, highlighted on Friday.

10	503253	Sri Lanka v Pakistan, World Cup 2011, Group A, Colombo	Afridi demands improvement despite victory	Osman Samiuddin in Colombo	February 26, 2011	#p#Shahid Afridi wasn't an entirely happy man after orchestrating <m1>"a very big win" over Sri Lanka at the R Premadasa</m1>, a result likely to have significant repercussions on Group A as the tournament progresses. #p#<m2>Afridi was at the centre of the triumph, picking up four key wickets</m2> as Pakistan overcame a late implosion in the field to sneak out with <m3>an 11-run win</m3>. The haul included his 300th ODI wicket, the third Pakistani to do so and only the second player after Sanath Jayasuriya to complete 300 wickets and 4000 runs in the format. With nine wickets in two games, he is for now the leading wicket-taker in the tournament. #p#But Pakistan's inability to finish off games over the last year has worried coach Waqar Younis and tonight's performance, deservedly triumphant ultimately, would not have eased those concerns. <m4>Sri Lanka lost their top order with less than 100 on the board</m4>, so by <m5>the 22nd over of the chase</m5>, the game seemed done. #p#<m6>Pakistan relaxed and proceeded to spill three catches</m6>, <m7>fluff two stumpings</m7> and miss a host of run-out attempts over the next 20 overs, allowing Chamara Silva, Kumar Sangakkara and Angelo Mathews to fight back. Amid the bedlam, they swiftly <m8>wasted two referrals</m8> and <m9>totted up 29 extras</m29> and though Afridi felt that "80%" of the task was done by then, he warned that improvement was needed. #p#Shahid Afridi is now the tournament's leading wicket-taker with nine scalps in two games. AFP Enlarge #p#"<m10>It's a very big win for us, beating Sri Lanka before a capacity crowd</m10>, their own people and a strong team which has been playing very well recently," Afridi said. "I think when we go ahead in this tournament our destination will get tougher and tougher and if we commit the same mistakes, then we will return to Pakistan very soon. We must improve. Our fielding has been improving since the New Zealand tour, but I don't know why in this match we <m11>dropped catches</m11> and <m12>failed to take run-out chances</m12>." #p#<m13>The win</m13> was built on the back of contributions from older players; <m14>fifties from Misbah-ul-Haq and Younis Khan set up the total </m14>and <m15>two wickets from Shoaib Akhtar</m15>, as well as <m16>Afridi's haul</m16>, helped defend it. Given the blend of youth and experience in the squad, it was an important contribution. "I'm happy that seniors have taken responsibility," he said. "Younis and Misbah are the backbone of the team, and it's important that the captain performs well as it sets an example for others." #p#Pakistan have a couple of days off now before their next game against Canada on March 3, also at the R Premadasa. There are likely to be changes for that game, to rest some players, but also for strategic reasons. Pakistan took an unchanged line-up into today's game, which meant they were using just three specialist bowlers and again not fully exploiting <m17>Abdul Razzaq: he faced four balls at the death</m17> and <m18>bowled five tidy overs</m18>. Another specialist bowler is likely to be considered. Misbah also picked up a hamstring strain during his innings and though it is not thought to be serious just yet, it might impact on the line-up for the Canada game. #p#"I will sit down and plan, I will take advice from my coach and from my senior players as it is everyone's team," Afridi said. "Winning is very important for us, it is a good habit and we should try to win every match and play hard with our strength. I think we will give rest to some of our players but definitely we want to win each and every game."
10	503254	Sri Lanka v Pakistan, World Cup 2011, Group A, Colombo	Top-order collapse cost match - Sangakkara	Sa'adi Thawfeeq in Colombo	February 26, 2011	#p#Kumar Sangakkara, the Sri Lanka captain, rued his side's top-order problems which wasted the solid start provided by the openers as <m1>they came up short in their run chase against Pakistan to register their first home defeat in a World Cup</m1>. #p#<m2>Tillakaratne Dilshan and Upul Tharanga put on 76 for the first wicket</m2> but <m3>Sri Lanka then lost 4 for 20 in seven overs</m3>. The middle order became bogged down as <m4>Chamara Silva struggled to build momentum</m4> until it was too late and despite <m5>Nuwan Kulasekara's brave effort</m5> the target always appeared out of reach. #p#"We did pretty well to <m6>restrict them to 277</m6> and the start we got was good enough to keep on batting, but when you <m7>lose four wickets in the same amount of overs and you are less than 100 for four wickets down</m7>, it makes it a bit difficult," Sangakkara said. "We can say that we missed Lasith [Malinga] a bit, but the guys were pretty up to it. #p#"On this track 277 was very gettable and you saw how close we came at the end. If we had done a little more hard work with the top order batsman, I think we would have made it and crossed the line. The real negative for us from this game is <m8>we lost a bunch of wickets in a very short space of time</m8>." #p#Sangakkara believes his side will have learned some valuable lessons from <m9>the defeat</m9>, a result that shouldn't hamper Sri Lanka's chances of progressing to the quarter-finals. "Also the fact that partnerships are important and we should never panic at any point," he said. "We were well behind the run rate, but <m10>we still fell only 10 run short</m10>. So basically if we had kept building partnerships, when we had that great start, I think it would have been a different story." #p#<m11>Tillakaratne Dilshan's departure came in the middle of a bad period for Sri Lanka in their run chase</m11>. Getty Images Enlarge #p#<m12>Shoaib Akhtar rolled back the years with an express delivery to remove Mahela Jayawardene</m12> which followed quickly from <m13>Shahid Afridi's removal of Dilshan for 41</m13>. "That kind of gives them the momentum and unfortunately that was the real critical period in this game," Sangakkara said. #p#Chasing is notoriously difficult at the R Premadasa but Sangakkara refused to use the toss as an excuse. "Winning tosses will not decide a match. On a pitch like this, had we played better cricket and done our basics especially in batting, we could have changed the decision." #p#And even in defeat there were elements of Sri Lanka's performance that pleased him including the role the spinners played in the Pakistan innings and how Silva overcame his sluggish start to give the home side a chance late in the chase. "[The spinners] were outstanding. The rest of the fast bowlers started off a bit shakily but I think we came back to the game pretty well," he said. "<m14>The opening partnership</m14> was great and <m15>the way Chamara Silva batted</m15>. #p#"<m16>Kulasekara again proved he can handle the bat well</m16> and Angelo Mathews unfortunately didn't have enough time to get himself set. When we were so far behind it is easy to say that's it and walk away from the game. But the way we fought it out and how close we came is I think we can do them. #p#"Pakistan are a very good side and well balanced. They showed today that they got a lot of pride also. Everyone writes off a team at their peril and cricket has a lot of surprises. Today they played better cricket than us all round."
10	503261	Sri Lanka v Pakistan, World Cup 2011, Group A, Colombo	A match of perfect twists and turns	Osman Samiuddin in Colombo	February 26, 2011	<m1>Shoaib Akhtar's removal from Mahela Jayawardene</m1> was one of many highlights in a pulsating match. Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: Misbah-ul-Haq | Muttiah Muralitharan | Shoaib Akhtar | Chamara Silva | Younis Khan Matches: Sri Lanka v Pakistan at Colombo (RPS) Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Pakistan | Sri Lanka #p#At last, a big game to match the occasion. The World Cup has needed this and the 50-overs game has needed it as well. This was ODI cricket at its most infectious, when you feel it inside you, when you can't help but respond to its many rhythms and nuances, shift around as it shifts it gears, when each one of the 100 overs of the day is of meaning and consequence. #p#There was atmosphere at the R Premadasa from the off, music and noise for once. Pakistan's openers came out at Sri Lanka's bowlers and a game was on our hands. <m2>Soon there was comedy, in Mohammad Hafeez's run-out, when men lose their wits utterly to the occasion itself.</m2> #p#There was then intelligence and wisdom in <m3>the partnership of Younis Khan and Misbah-ul-Haq</m3>. For those who lack an appreciation of subtlety, the middle overs are hell. But <m4>how beautifully the pair manipulated angles and found space, a dink here, a deflection there, and how hard they ran. With barely any boundaries, the pair put on a 108-run stand at near enough a run a ball and the pace never felt as if it was slacking. In all they ran 65 singles and ten twos</m4>, true descendants of Asif Iqbal and Javed Miandad. Simultaneously there was the very physical appreciation of Sri Lankans in the field. Inside the circle they zipped around, like flying fish, hungry. #p#There was individual genius. In the build-up to this game, Pakistan spoke of Muttiah Muralitharan as if he wasn't Muttiah Muralitharan. He's too old, we play him well enough, he doesn't take wickets against us as he used to. All of this is essentially correct. Pakistan have learnt to play Muralitharan well but he still turned the entire nature of their innings, with his bowling at the death. It was mesmerising stuff, a reminder of his quite immense brain, against a bright young talent, and a batsman set and in real form. Basically it was defence, but beautiful and actually a form of attack. #p#The evening was lit up by those skills that, in the hands of limited overs, these days can often feel like the cricket equivalent of Didier Deschamps, football's most (in)famous water-carrier: called on for the dirty, unglamorous chores. Two passages of action were outstanding. The first was Shoaib Akhtar, who even at this stage in his career, is capable of recreating the heat every now and again of his early years. As a spectacle, <m5>pinging back Mahela Jayawardene's middle stump was difficult to better</m5> and it probably turned the game. #p#<m6>In the next over, Shahid Afridi's delicious undoing of Thilan Samaraweera effectively sealed matters.</m6> Pace at one end and leg-spin at the other: it is not an unusual combination any more but the richness of its choreography and the vast possibilities it contains has always been brought out best by Pakistan. #p#Later, we saw how men and collectives can fall apart. Pakistan do it often but there's always a strange calmness about how it happens. To the eye, it doesn't feel like anything is breaking down. No one is running about shouting or screaming, there are smiles and expressionless faces and bemused smiles. Yet easy catches are dropped, run-outs missed, misfields, wides and no-balls bowled, poor decisions made and so on. #p#Chamara Silva came close to pulling off the most cunning heist so that there was always punch and counter punch, so that for every wicket that fell late on, a boundary was the response, cricket in perfect balance as it should be. Of course the result sets the rest of the tournament up just right. Co-hosts and favourites beaten by dark horses is a story that sells and sells. #p#Suddenly you look at the schedule and repercussions are discussed. The tournament has meaning. Pakistan will pop up on to a lot of people's radars and they will be talked about because this is a serious result, achieved with an unbalanced side that finds it difficult to finish off games.

10	503673		'Chasing at Premadasa no longer difficult'	Mahela Jayawardene	March 1, 2011	On pitches favourable for batting, Lasith Malinga gives Sri Lanka a strong attacking option. AFP Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: Mahela Jayawardene Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Sri Lanka #p#We always knew the game against Pakistan was going to be a good contest. It was going to be tough for the quick bowlers on that track, especially during the day when it was flat and not doing much. We weren't disciplined enough in the execution of our plans in the first 10 to 15 overs. We gave away quite a few easy boundaries, so that is an area we will definitely address. #p#<m1>Younis Khan and Misbah-ul-Haq are two experienced players and they built the Pakistan innings after the loss of three wickets.</m1> They steadied the innings, didn't take too many risks and set it up nicely for the big hitters down the order. But our spinners did well and the seamers came back strongly in the latter part of the innings, not allowing those big hitters to flourish. #p#Where we lost it was with the bat. <m2>Losing those three wickets in quick time - Tillakaratne Dilshan, myself and Thilan Samaraweera for 8</m2> - probably cost us. <m3>Shahid Afridi bowled really well during that middle period, taking four wickets</m3>, and that spell proved crucial. <m4>We tried to build the innings through Chamara Silva and Kumar Sangakkara</m4>, and the lower order had a good run, but we left it too late. <m5>With the required-rate creeping over 10</m5>, it was going to be tough but <m6>in the end we fell short by just 11 runs</m6>, so there were some positives we could take out from the game. #p#Chasing under lights at the Premadasa is no longer that difficult. The floodlights were one of the reasons teams struggled to chase at night at the ground, as they couldn't pick the ball on occasion. Since the revamp, with new lights and a re-laid track, things have certainly eased out. Earlier, teams used to have difficulty chasing even 220 but now the toss is not going to play a major factor unless the track deteriorates drastically. But, nevertheless, to chase under lights, once a team puts a score up on the board, there's going to be pressure. That's the only scenario to be worried about but the other elements are not a factor anymore. #p#We're only going to get batting-friendly pitches this tournament. The only way going forward will be to try and control the batsmen. To do that, you need to have attacking options in your armoury. The Australians are playing to their strengths, using pace as a means of attack. They might flourish in certain conditions, in others they might not. The important thing is to have bowlers who can pick up wickets, particularly when the tracks are flat and it's easy to score 300. We're hoping for Lasith Malinga to get back into his stride, with that we'll have enough bowling options in the side to pick up wickets. #p#With our batting, we're trying to establish a rhythm. Chamara Silva missed out in the first game because he had a family bereavement a few days earlier, and we gave him a week off. He's been a big part of the middle order and was part of the last World Cup, that experience is vital for us going forward. It's good to have him back and score some runs against Pakistan. Angelo Mathews - when and how we're going to use him in the batting line-up - is also going to be a key factor. Samaraweera brings solidity to our middle order. There is, of course, Chamara Kapugedera, and there's the option of him coming in depending on whom we're playing and what kind of tactics we use for different opposition. It's a settled middle order - it hasn't really had much opportunity because the top order has been getting a bulk of the runs. I do hope that when they get that opportunity, they'll come to the party and have a good workout. #p#Against Kenya, we just need to play to our strengths. We did that against Canada as well. That'll be the main focus, rather than worry about anything else.
10	503773	Sri Lanka v Pakistan, Group A, World Cup 2011, Colombo	SLC angry over allegation against players	ESPNcricinfo staff	March 1, 2011	#p#A potential dispute involving two leading cricketers, Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) and a state-owned channel appears to have been doused after the channel issued a clarification over remarks made by an anchor following <m1>Sri Lanka's 11-run loss to Pakistan on Saturday</m1>. #p#A commentary on Sunday on Sri Lanka's state TV network, ITN, said a businessman had bet roughly 18,000 on a Pakistan victory and, according to an SLC release, implied "that our players might have been involved in match-fixing." #p#SLC condemned the comments and said it would be taking up the matter "with the relevant authorities of this channel, based on the fact that this channel has brought great distress to two of our national cricketers." After Sri Lanka's nine-wicket win over Kenya on Tuesday, a board official said that the matter would be discussed with lawyers and board authorities. #p#Soon after the SLC release, ITN issued its own clarification. "It must be emphasised that our intention was purely not to embarrass" the players. "We wish to express our deep concern if the contents of the programme had hurt both of them or any other party. Today's "Vimasuma" [the name of the show] was based on making further clarifications with regard to the earlier programme." #p#Sri Lanka's team manager Anura Tennekoon denied there would be any inquiry from the SLC or from the International Cricket Council (ICC). "Knowing both [the players], we feel there is no necessity to investigate the matter and, as far as the ICC has concerned, they have the right to investigate but so far they have not brought anything on this," Tennekoon said. "But we will discuss the matter with our lawyer as well."
11	503185	India v England, World Cup 2011, Group B, Bangalore	An occasion to test nerves and character	The Preview by Andrew McGlashan	February 26, 2011	#p#Match Facts #p#February 27, Bangalore #p#Start time 14.30 (0900 GMT) #p#Michael Yardy could be recalled by England to bolster the spin-bowling department Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: Stuart Broad | Virender Sehwag | Michael Yardy Matches: India v England at Bangalore Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: England | India #p#The Big Picture #p#The build-up and hype ahead of this match has been huge and we are still barely into the second week of the World Cup. This was always going to be one of the marquee clashes of the tournament, and even though it has been moved away from Eden Gardens to the slightly less daunting Chinnaswamy Stadium, that hasn't dulled the anticipation. You only need to see the unfortunate pictures from outside the ground during the week, as locals rushed for tickets, to know how desperate they are to watch their team. #p#However, there are two sides taking part and England are insisting they can use the expectation being piled on to the hosts in their favour. From a purely cricket view, the stadium switch won't have disappointed Andrew Strauss's team because, both on and off the field in Bangalore, conditions will be slightly less hostile than could have been the case in Kolkata. #p#Yet England's record against India in their own backyard makes for grim reading. They have won one of their last 13 completed ODIs in the country, going back to the 5-1 drubbing in 2006 and the 5-0 scoreline in 2008, before the series was cancelled due to the Mumbai bombings. In between they were also thrashed at the 2006 Champions Trophy. On one hand the odds say they are due a win, but on the other the statistics make damning reading. #p#If they want to spoil India's World Cup party the key will be containing the power-packed top order. Virender Sehwag set down the gauntlet with 175 against Bangaldesh and was backed up by Virat Kohli's fine hundred. Sachin Tendulkar was cut short on 25, while Yuvraj Singh and MS Dhoni didn't even need to bat. It's a daunting prospect, but England have shown they can rise for the big occasion. Whatever happens, let's hope it matches the expectation. #p#Form guide (completed matches, most recent first) #p#India WLLWW England WLLLW #p#Watch out for... #p#Ahead of India matches, it's the likes of Sehwag, Tendulkar, Dhoni and Harbhajan Singh who take most of the headlines, but you ignore Gautam Gambhir at your peril. He has become a supremely consistent batsman across all formats and is the perfect foil to his top-order team-mates. He started with a neat run-a-ball 39 against Bangladesh and England will have to ensure they give him as much focus as the mega-star names around him. A one-day average of 34 against England, six runs below his career level, is something he'll want to correct, but the visiting bowlers will want to increase that daylight. #p#None of England's quicks can be pleased with their efforts against Netherlands, but there were some encouraging signs from Stuart Broad in his first international since the second Ashes Test. Having warmed up with 10 wickets in two games against Canada and Pakistan, he bowled with decent pace against the Dutch and found bounce from a flat Nagpur surface. However, he sometimes got carried away with banging the ball in and forgot to aim at the stumps. His yorker can be effective (he was denied such a wicket when Paul Collingwood forgot to walk inside the circle) and against top-quality batsmen he'll have to be ready to adjust his game plans. #p#Talking of the quick bowlers, one of the reasons the venue switch isn't all bad news is the bounce that could be on offer. It won't be flying through at shoulder height, but the quick bowlers are likely to find some encouragement especially after the recent heavy rain in the city. One-day cricket is at its best with an even contest between bat and ball. #p#Team news #p#Virender Sehwag was struck in the ribs during a net session but is expected to be fine for the match and India have no reason to tinker with the top order. The big question mark comes with Sreesanth, who had a nightmare against Bangladesh when his five overs went for 53. India got away with it that day, but can't afford to carry a bowler in every match. However, Ashish Nehra is not yet at full fitness so India will have to decide whether to stick with Sreesanth or play an extra spinner. #p#India (possible) 1 Virender Sehwag, 2 Sachin Tendulkar, 3 Gautam Gambhir, 4 Virat Kohli, 5 Yuvraj Singh, 6 MS Dhoni (capt & wk), 7 Yusuf Pathan, 8 Harbhajan Singh, 9 Zaheer Khan, 10 Sreesanth/Piyush Chawla, 11 Munaf Patel. #p#Broad has been suffering from an upset stomach but is expected to be fit and England's main decision is whether to strengthen their spin-bowling with a recall for Michael Yardy. The current plan is to get 10 overs from Paul Collingwood and Kevin Pietersen but that's a huge risk against India. The problem is, though, that the man most likely to make way for Yardy would be Ravi Bopara, who helped see the team home against Netherlands. #p#England (possible) 1 Andrew Strauss (capt), 2 Kevin Pietersen, 3 Jonathan Trott, 4 Ian Bell, 5 Paul Collingwood, 6 Ravi Bopara, 7 Matt Prior (wk), 8 Tim Bresnan, 9 Stuart Broad, 10 Graeme Swann, 11 James Anderson #p#Try picking the XIs for tomorrow's game by playing Team Selector. #p#Pitch and conditions #p#There was torrential rain in Bangalore on Friday afternoon which left large puddles on the outfield. The weather has remained cool and cloudy over the weekend, and there is a chance of more showers, which will make the toss important with the possible intervention of Duckworth-Lewis. The damp weather may work against Yardy, but the pitch turned square in the warm-up matches. #p#Stats and trivia #p#Despite all the talk about Sehwag, his average against England in India is the lowest of the current top six - 37.70 - but the strike-rate is 100. #p#Sreesanth's performance against Bangladesh was horrid, but he has 10 wickets at 16 each against England in India. #p#Unsurprisingly, Pietersen is England's best batsman in India with an average of 56.08 from 14 matches and the lone century among the team's current top order #p#India and England have met three times in Bangalore and it's the visitors who actually lead the head-to-head 2-1, although the wins did come back in 1985 and 1993. #p#Quotes #p#"I don't think it's a case of reinventing the wheel, we just need to play good, smart cricket. In some ways there's more pressure on India than us in this game." Andrew Strauss turns to the psychological battle as he aims to turn around England's poor record in India. #p#"We are not celebrating yet, that's for sure. Of course, we had a good start in the opening game, where we batted really well and after that spinners did a good job in the middle overs. Again, I think it's about the team that will start well and hold the nerves for a consistent period of time." MS Dhoni chooses to play it safe.
11	503238	India v England, World Cup 2011, Group B, Bangalore	After the controversy, time for the cricket	Sharda Ugra in Bangalore	February 26, 2011	#p#The team called the Rock Stars of Cricket announced their arrival at the Chinnaswamy Stadium with the most unusual sound. Not guitar, not drums, but the echo of a conch-shell. #p#It came from their bald, body-painted travelling fan and it sounded significantly sonorous, the ceremonial trumpet that it is meant to be. If Sri Lanka and Pakistan set off the weekend with a heated contest at the Premadasa, the least India against England in Bangalore must do is live up to its advertising. Of being firecracker or pressure cooker or, at the very least, a big sink. This is, to use a rather dark pun, the 2011 World Cup's big-ticket game. #p#Much theatre has circulated around the game even before even a ball was bowled. It has been moved from Indian cricket's iconic venue, the Eden Gardens, due to organisational blunders. It has been the reason that close to 3000 people lined up at 2am for tickets and, within few hours, a thousand were scattered by the police's five-foot long bamboo batons. It has also brought the biggest contingent of travelling fans to this World Cup. It had better not rain. In less than the first two minutes of his press conference, MS Dhoni used the word "important" six times. #p#When he was done with his ten minutes of answering questions to a roomful of around 120 people, Dhoni walked out onto the outfield carrying his kit like a backpack, as if he were a tourist sauntering down towards the Anil Kumble Circle, past the 11 TV broadcast vans lined up near the ground. Dhoni was heading out to inspect the wicket which in India's practice match against Australia did not thrill their batsmen with its ease, but built the case for their bowling balance they were looking for. #p#It still does not mean that Piyush Chawla will be an automatic pick on Sunday. Or that Harbhajan Singh will open the bowling like the six other teams who have opened their bowling with spin in this first week of the World Cup. It will only mean that England will have to prove that they are, as Andrew Strauss believes, an improved batting team against spinners bowling in their very element. #p#MS Dhoni is used to deal with the expectations of billions Associated Press Enlarge #p#India's batsmen moved swiftly on from their stutter in the Bangalore match to a general feeling of well-being after Dhaka. Their worries with the bat are far removed from the strugglers in this competition. The most important question must be whether Virender Sehwag will keep the promise he made to himself of batting 50 overs and then maybe even field. Dhoni seemed to think that 30 overs do nicely. Yet for all that India's batsmen did against Bangladesh, they will be up against a far better and more organised bowling attack, Stuart Broad's upset stomach not withstanding. #p#The most mouth-watering rivalry in the contest, though, rather than that of batsman versus bowler, might well be between the two lead offspinners, Harbhajan Singh and Graeme Swann. The last time the two teams met at the same venue it rained. The result was decided by Duckworth-Lewis and India took a 4-0 lead in a series that would be truncated three days later by the attacks in Mumbai. Swann was just finding his feet in India and Harbhajan had gone for 42 in four overs. #p#Since then, cricket, Swann and Harbhajan have travelled a vast distance. Today, Swann is regarded as the world's No. 1 spinner and recently, Harbhajan said that it was Swann's videos that helped him find the rhythm that led to of his best performances in recent years on the tour to South Africa. #p#Given the drama that has followed this match, if India do feel in a mood to gamble or surprise maybe they should give their new left-arm spinning option an early go at England's latest ODI opener. Being out to Yuvraj Singh five times (just one less than Harbhajan, not kidding) could just mean that Kevin Pietersen doesn't like pies. But that's no reason not to try. Dhoni, celebrated for his occasional wild gambles, once threw Yuvraj an almost new ball in a Test just to put the pies out again. #p#After the India net session, there was a meeting between Dhoni, coach Gary Kirsten, physiotherapist Nitin Patel and BCCI secretary N Srinivasan. Rather than discuss the Ashish Nehra injury situation, maybe they were planning the innings-break menu to ensure that it follows the coach's 'eight rules of eating' found in his vision document. #p#They were in the full glare of the hawk-eyed media, whose ranks swell every game. Their numbers could well rival those of ticket-seekers outside the Chinnaswamy of whose fate, Dhoni said: "It's unfortunate that some of the fans had to go through it. But again when the Indian team don't perform you have to go through a lot of criticism so I feel that it is part and parcel... Maybe some of them wouldn't have felt so bad because at the end of the day, they want to get tickets. So that's what I want to say." #p#"Part and parcel" of an India game includes the public expectation of a victory. Defeat would affect the confidence on the street far more than that of the team and had Dhoni not just given us all a glimpse of what he thinks of the street? He described, mostly for overseas journalists to whom it might be new, what it was like to be India at the World Cup. "Pressure always comes when you start playing for your country," he said. "First, you want to seal a permanent place and then be consistent. When you are part of the team the pressure follows you like your own shadow." His counterpart, Strauss, offered another option. "I don't think it's the time to take the pressure off. It's a World Cup and we all need to stand up and perform." #p#One man leads a team who is trailed by billions, the other captains a side that has just erased a quarter-century of cricketing misery in Australia. #p#It had better not rain.

Players/Officials: Tim Bresnan | Stuart Broad | Virender Sehwag | Andrew Strauss | Sachin Tendulkar | Michael Yardy Matches: India v England at Bangalore Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: England | India #p#On an evening that simply beggared belief, <m9>England tied with India in an incredible finale in Bangalore</m9>. <m10>Andrew Strauss was England's inspiration, producing an extraordinary 158 from 145 balls</m10>, the highest score by an English batsman in World Cup history, as England threatened the unthinkable, and set off in full pursuit of <m11>India's seemingly unobtainable total of 338</m11> - a score that had been made possible by <m12>a brilliant 120 from Sachin Tendulkar</m12>. #p#Such was <m13>the clarity of Strauss's strokeplay</m13> and the passivity of India's attack, <m14>at 280 for 2 in the 43rd over</m14>, England were cruising towards an extraordinary triumph. However <m15>a late intervention, sparked by a reverse-swinging Zaheer Khan, left them clawing for breath</m15> as a silenced Chinnaswamy stadium rediscovered its roar, and <m16>when the requirement shot up beyond two runs a ball</m16>, there seemed no way back into the contest.

But in between whiles, the game belonged to England, as <m28>India shipped their last seven wickets in 25 balls</m28> to let their opponents regain a toe-hold in the contest, before turning the stage over to Strauss and his magnum opus. #p#A positive start was a pre-requisite as England embarked on their second daunting chase in as many matches, and just as <m29>Strauss had soothed his team's anxieties with 88 from 83 balls</m29> after their flirtation with humiliation against the Dutch, he was once again in the thick of things right from the start of the innings. Zaheer, who was as poor with the new ball as he was devastating with the old, bowled both sides of the wicket to gift two boundaries in six balls, and Strauss was up and running. He barely dipped below a run a ball at any subsequent stage of his innings. #p#<m30>He required some moments of luck, particularly on 17 when TV replays suggested he had nicked a drive against Zaheer that the Indian fielders were unable to hear against the din of the crowd</m30>, but for the most part he was rewarded for his intent and aggression, and a common-sense approach to the three key partnerships that propelled England's challenge. By the end of <m31>the batting Powerplay</m31>, <m32>England were 19 runs to the good, on 77 for 1</m32> compared to <m33>India's 10-over total of 58 for 1</m33>, and with a stream of easy singles to offset the intermittent boundary balls, they never looked like blinking until the summit was within sight. #p#<m34>Sachin Tendulkar launched his innings in ominous style</m34>. Getty Images Enlarge #p#At the top of the order, <m35>Kevin Pietersen's stay was short, sharp and effective</m35>. <m36>He pounded four fours in eight Zaheer deliveries to rush along to 31 from 22 balls</m36>, before <m37>dumping Munaf on his backside with a brutally struck drive, only for the ball he had parried from in front of his face to plop into his left hand as he glanced up to regain his bearings.</m37> <m38>Trott proved an able ally in a 43-run stand for the second wicket</m38> before <m39>Chawla hurried one through to strike his back pad</m39>, whereupon <m40>Bell arrived to embark on what should have been the game's decisive stand - a 170-run partnership that spanned 27 overs.</m40> #p#<m41>Bell, England's best player of spin, was beaten twice in his first two balls as Chawla ripped first his googly then his legspinner to perfection</m41>, but <m42>his hairiest moment came on 17, when Yuvraj Singh referred an appeal for lbw that Hawkeye suggested met all the criteria for an overturned decision. However, umpire Billy Bowden, applying the letter of the law even if it meant contravening the evidence on a billion TV screens, reprieved Bell on the grounds that he had advanced more than 2.5 metres down the pitch, and that the technology's prediction could not be deemed conclusive.</m42> #p#The despondency of the crowd was reflected in India's subsequent bowling, as <m43>Strauss motored through to his sixth ODI century, from 99 balls</m43>, and <m44>on towards his third in excess of 150</m44>. Liberated by the match situation, <m45>he launched Yuvraj for one of the biggest sixes of his career, straight down the ground</m45>, to bring up <m46>the hundred partnership</m46>, and <m47>Bell did likewise to Chawla to rush through to his fifty from 45 balls</m47>. #p#It was England's decision to take <m48>the batting Powerplay</m48>, at <m49>280 for 2 in the 43rd over</m49>, that triggered the devastating late reversal of momentum. India's last chance appeared to have gone begging when <m50>Bell, on 68, was dropped by Virat Kohli at slip off Chawla</m50>, but <m51>Kohli made amends 10 balls later, when Bell miscued a tired slog off Zaheer to extra cover</m51>. <m52>With the crowd alive to the contest once again, Zaheer then put himself on a hat-trick with an unplayable late-swinging yorker that crushed Strauss's toe in front of leg stump.</m52> #p#With the pressure proving smothering and Chawla's variations now illegible to the new batsmen, <m53>Paul Collingwood missed a wipe across the line to be bowled for 1 from five balls</m53>, before <m54>Prior gave up all hope of threading the gaps and took a huge top-edged heave at Harbhajan to be caught for 4 from 8</m54>. <m55>Michael Yardy chipped and chivvied before dinking an attempted boundary shot straight to Sehwag at short backward square</m55>, but <m56>it was Swann's flat six off Chawla</m56>, with <m57>29 needed from two overs</m57>, that reawakened England's challenge. <m58>Three balls later, Bresnan also put Chawla into the stands</m58>, and though <m59>he was bowled having a mow in the same over</m59>, <m60>Ajmal Shahzad sent his first ball, from Patel, in the same direction</m60>, to set up the grandstand finish. #p#If England felt that they'd let a golden opportunity go, then at least it could be said that they proved themselves equal to one of the best performances of a legendary career. Even by Tendulkar's matchless standards, his was a vintage performance, and a masterful example of how to pace an innings. He was a casual bystander in the day's opening exchanges, while <m61>Sehwag ran amok</m61>, before picking up his tempo throughout <m62>a second-wicket stand of 134 with Gautam Gambhir</m62>, without ever needing to take risks to make his mark. <m63>The high point of his innings came when he belted consecutive sixes at the start of Swann's second spell</m63>, a calculated show of class that undermined England's trump bowler, and left Strauss floundering for alternatives as his tactics were picked apart. #p#<m64>In all Tendulkar stroked 10 fours and five sixes</m64> in what was, somewhat curiously, his first one-day hundred against England for nine years. By the time <m65>he was dismissed with 11 overs of the innings remaining, caught off a leading edge at cover</m65> (to give James Anderson his first one-day wicket in India for 53 overs dating back to 2006, on a day in which he conceded the most expensive analysis in England's World Cup history), <m66>India's total stood at an imposing 236 for 3</m66>, and it was a measure both of Tendulkar's brilliance and of England's dogged refusal to give in, that Yuvraj and MS Dhoni were unable to cut loose to quite the extent they might have expected. #p#The omens for England had not been exactly positive going into the start of this match. Eleven defeats in their last 12 away matches against India underlined their status of underdogs, as did the two team's respective performances in their opening fixtures of the tournament - England's laboured victory over the Netherlands compared distinctly unfavourably to India's crunching win against Bangladesh in Dhaka, and when Stuart Broad, their best and most aggressive seamer, was ruled out with a stomach complaint before the start of the match, a vast swathe of England's gameplan went down with him. Nevertheless, they thought on their feet and showed precisely the pluck that was in stasis throughout their one-day campaign in Australia. Two of the best teams in the world were on show in Bangalore, and what a show they produced. #p#Match Timeline

AFP Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: Zaheer Khan | Munaf Patel | Ajmal Shahzad | Andrew Strauss Matches: India v England at Bangalore Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: England | India #p#The Six. Never mind what Sachin Tendulkar did or Andrew Strauss did. Or <m2>how Ajmal Shazad had bowled</m2>. <m3>When he faced the third ball of the last over, England needed 11 off the last four balls of the match. Munaf Patel bowled length, Shahzad squared his shoulders and swung. The ball landed into disbelieving specators at the mid-off boundary near the KSCA club house. It was the shot that helped England get out of their Powerplay prison and tie the game. Well, at least the shot showed them they could actually survive the jitters.</m3> #p#The Double Whammy. Just <m4>when things were coasting for England - 59 needed off 48</m4> - there arrived on England's path, the bogeyman in disguise. Also known as <m5>the batting Powerplays</m5> that makes teams, and the batsmen that must take them, go loopy. When it must be faced against the most highly-skilled bowler in the team, the portents are ominous. <m6>Ian Bell who had just been treated for cramps was trying to rush over the finish line, eyeing perhaps heave-ho corner but ballooning one to the fielder at mid-off.</m6> Off the next ball, <m7>Zaheer Khan found the captain's toes with a yorker</m7> and for England, the plot began to sicken. #p#The Catch. Surely the most unathletic of India's fielders can't take the catch that looked like being match changing? Oh yes he can, if he is under threat of having his skull fractured. <m8>With England racing to 68 in the 10th over</m8> and Kevin Pietersen's strokeplay swallowing up all the noise of the Chinnaswamy Stadium, Patel found fortune favouring his reflexes. <m9>A straight drive with full blood written on it headed for Patel's cranium and naturally the man fended it off with his hands as far away as he could. The shot had thrown him off his feet and the ball bobbed up over him at a reasonable pace. On its way down, it met Patel's outstretched palm. On ya bike, Mr Pietersen</m9>. Not that it meant anything in the context of the game eventually. #p#The Missing Single. How does one describe this without embarrassment spreading through the Indian dressing room? <m10>With wickets falling, 4-11 off the last 11 balls of the Indian innings</m10>, <m11>Zaheer Khan had madly scrambled for a second on the very last ball. Unable to be the Usain Bolt of 22m, Zaheer was run out but then discovered, as did the entire ground, that the first run didn't even count.</m11> <m12>Munaf Patel had not put his bat inside the crease after the first run before gambolling over for the second. So one less on the total. One run less for England to make.</m12> As punishment, the fates decreed that it would be <m13>Patel who would bowl the final over</m13> which would <m14>tie the game</m14>. Which gave India one point less than what a victory would have. Which would have happened had the missing single not been missed. No doubt by a single inch or so. #p#The Opportunity. The first one, the first ball, the first strike. <m15>Bowler Jimmy Anderson on whom rested England's quick bowling hopes. Batsman Virender Sehwag who decided that, today, he wanted to leave the business of building platforms to the ministry of railways. In his mind he wanted to have one racing over the Chinnaswamy grass past the boundary, but in reality he sent an edge towards second slip. Had Graeme Swann held on it would have been a show-off snatch but, sadly for England, it didn't.</m15> <m16>Two balls later, one went off Sehwag's leading edge past a diving Ian Bell in the covers.</m16> <m17>A third edge followed in the over</m17> and even though <m18>Sehwag didn't last much longer</m18>, the rest of Anderson's day was ruined. #p#Zaheer Khan gets two in two: 'batting' Powerplay? Really? AFP Enlarge #p#The Fly Swatter. <m19>What happens when a ball is short, widish, sits up and begs to be hit? With several options before him, Sehwag took a look at Anderson's offering and thought about his shots. Not the pull, no. Surely the cut. Enough. Sehwag whacked it, cross-batted, in the air over mid-on, bringing in a new dimension to the word, 'groundstroke'. It's called the Fly Swatter.</m19> Since all these fizzy drinks wallahs are posing as inventors of trendy, new cricketing terminology, ESPNcricinfo is going to patent this one. So there. #p#Oops of the Day. On an afternoon when they fielded far, far better than they had gone against Netherlands, England's Keystone Kops moment came from the most unexpected sources. <m20>Yuvraj Singh glided one from Michael Yardy, where a respectable single would have been fair all-round. Graeme Swann, one of the better fielders in the team, was in line at short third-man, had it covered, sorted. Nope. A bungled collection and it was past him to the boundary rope.</m20> Could India possibly beat that? (Err, shall we count the ways?) #p#Munaf's Other Moment. The small anthem ceremony begins with a bunch of kids, carrying the flags of competing nations and the ICC to a piece of Vangelis music called 'Conquest of Paradise'. Once they are in place, the players walk out with children, who are winners of a sponsor's contest. It is the only time in the match the players keep their game faces off holding the kids' hands, patting their heads, some chatting to them and putting their arms around small shoulders. Munaf Patel went one step further. He decided to spare the child next to him the trouble of trying to keep step. Patel picked the tyke up and put him under his arm, carrying him to the spot where they were to stand. When the child was on his feet again, both Patel's and his smiles were bigger than the ground. #p#People Power. Cricket spectators in India are used to being taken for granted. Sometimes they can feel lucky just about not getting roughed up. But in the Chinnaswamy Stadium this afternoon they could gloat about earning a small, but important, victory. A jib camera, ones that are mounted on a crane and used to get close-up shots of crowds in the stands, was positioned just in front of the one of hospitality stands at the ground level. To start with, as the camera swung in on them, the fans responded enthusiastically as they always do. But as soon as the game started it became clear that the crane was at the eyeline of those in the front rows. Soon a chorus began to move it and grew louder and more intense by the minute. But even the most optimistic of the lot wouldn't have bargained for what came next. The crew started dismantling the unit and in a matter of minutes it had disappeared from sight.

AFP Enlarge Related Links Report : <m2>Epic encounter ends in thrilling tie</m2>. Players/Officials: MS Dhoni Matches: India v England at Bangalore Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: England | India #p#First things first. The fans and the organisers must give thanks to India and England for conspiring to produce an extraordinary finish that has ignited the World Cup after ten days of relative torpor. Six hundred and seventy six runs, 18 wickets and <m3>a heart-stopping tie</m3> ensure that the match will linger in the memory of anyone present. But in the cold light of cricket logic, the reverse of what is normally said of a tie will apply to this match: <m4>the tie was a fair result</m4> because neither team deserved to win. #p#The outcome would have left both teams with both relief and regret. India would be relieved because they found their way back into a match which seemed hopelessly lost, and then <m5>did not concede more than a single off the last ball</m5> after <m6>the first five of the final over had gone for 12</m6>. But how did they let England amble to a match-winning position in the first place, after <m7>scoring 338</m7>? And how did they manage to <m8>concede 28 to the tailenders in the last two overs</m8> after knocking over <m9>four wickets for 25 runs in the batting Powerplay</m9>? #p#England would be mightily relieved after <m10>the Powerplay choke</m10> had left them with <m11>42 to get off 24 balls</m11> with all their specialist batsmen gone, and they would take overall satisfaction from constructing such an epic chase. But just how did they manage to botch it <m12>from 278 for 2 with 61 needed off 54 balls</m12>? #p#The match featured some splendid performances, and in many ways those mirrored each other. There were <m13>polished and controlled hundreds from Sachin Tendulkar</m13>, the game's enduring icon, and <m14>Andrew Strauss, who has found his batting mojo in this form of the game</m14> in the second half of his career; there was <m15>outstanding bowling from Tim Bresnan</m15>, which was responsible for <m16>keeping India down to 338</m16>, if such a thing can be said, and there were <m17>three skillful and cunning overs from Zaheer Khan that brought India back into the game</m17>. There were strong support acts from the No. 4 batsmen - Yuvraj Singh and Ian Bell - and both were dismissed at crucial junctures which led to the innings dipping into decline. #p#But the enduring image of the match would be the <m18>last-over six from Ajmal Shehzad</m18>, hit so cleanly and with such majesty that it might have come from the middle of Tendulkar's bat. For that, and for mounting such an improbable chase with such aplomb for the large part of the innings, England would take more from the match than their fancied rivals. India were expected to bat big; England, despite botching up the chase, surpassed expectations. #p#Their one-day team was annihilated when they toured India the last time. Their progress since then was never doubted, and with this, they have served notice: while the bowling worries remain, with the bat, they can chase. #p#India have known even before a ball had been bowled in this World Cup that whatever success they were to achieve they had to do it off their bat. But on Sunday night, they were served the starkest possible reminder that whatever they can do with bat can be easily lost on the field. The track at the Chinnaswamy Stadium was, according to Strauss, unbelievably flat and MS Dhoni said it got even better during the second innings. Still, the frightening aspect from the Indian point of view was not merely that England almost chased their total down, but how easily they did it till the 43rd over. #p#The format of this World Cup has been designed to insure them against the embarrassment of an early exit, but for the most part, their performance in defending a total never chased even on the flattest and deadest Indian pitches - the highest successful run chase on Indian soil is 325 by India against West Indies in 2002 - was an epic embarrassment in its own right: it has swiftly shorn them of their aura, and the tag of the favourites. #p#Every time they bat first, this question will haunt their batsmen: just how much is safe enough? Nine days ago, it was only the margin of victory that muted the questions about their ability with ball after Bangladesh had taken 280 runs off them in the World Cup opener, but so lacking in energy and spirit were they on the field on Sunday that a win for them would have been a travesty. #p#<m19>It was only after the 43rd over, when Zaheer produced two wickets in two balls, that the Indian fielding acquired a sense of urgency and charge.</m19> Suddenly the fielders in the ring attacked the ball, a couple of diving stops were made, and outfielders sprang to life. Till then infielders had hung back and allowed the batsmen to stroll singles (<m20>England scored 134 of them</m20> compared to <m21>India's 107</m21>) and fielders in the deep acted as perfect escort services to the fence. Their outcricket made India's meagre bowling resources look even thinner. #p#In their first warm-up match, their bowlers had defended 213 against Australia on the same square. But the ball spat and turned then. The curator had since been nudged to flatten it out, and on the belter that was laid out, the first part went to script for India. But the second provided glimpses of what lies ahead. Apart from Zaheer in <m22>those Powerplay overs</m22>, no bowler ever came close to being able to apply pressure; <m23>Harbhajan Singh was the most economical</m23>, but he was picked off with ease and <m24>conceded 10 runs in the crucial 46th over</m24>, and while <m25>Piyush Chawla had two wickets</m25>, <m26>he conceded the maximum boundaries: five fours and three sixes</m26>. The lack of skill from the bowlers was merely exacerbated by apologetic fielding. #p#Dhoni sounded nearly resigned to the ineptitude in the field. "We could have defended this total if we had a better fielding side," he said, "but we have to make do with what we have got." But if this is the best they can put up, their batsmen would have to bat out of their skin for the rest of the tournament. Never has a team so light in bowling and so heavy on its feet won a World Cup. #p#But from a broader perspective, this was the match the World Cup needed. However flawed, it was highly entertaining: it had twists and turns; big hitting and lots of wickets; drama and suspense; and the rarest of results. The stadium was a spectacle, and the crowd, however partisan, went back with a match to remember. Dhaka gave the tournament a passionate start, Bangalore has brought it alive.
11	503410	India v England, World Cup 2011, Group B, Bangalore	Strauss and Tendulkar weave a tapestry to savour	Sharda Ugra in Bangalore	February 27, 2011	<m1>Andrew Strauss produced a masterful innings that showed a true craftsman at work</m1>. Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: Andrew Strauss | Sachin Tendulkar Matches: India v England at Bangalore Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: England | India #p#India v England, the World Cup, Bangalore, was supposed to be Razzmatazz Central. Chinnaswamy was heaving, sometimes spontaneously, often annoyingly orchestrated by a giant screen trying to get an Indian cricket crowd to follow instructions. There was schmaltzy muzak between overs, a "shout meter" and regular sightings of business tycoons, Bollywood stars and many Unidentified Importants. It was showtime and it awaited the showboaters of both teams to seize centre stage. #p#But right there in the middle of all this, for about five hours, there were these two geezers doing needlepoint. #p#To mention Sachin Tendulkar and Andrew Strauss in the same sentence as fabric and embroidery is to invite lawsuits, so it must be swiftly said that they were not involved in stitching of any sort in Bangalore. Other than their team's innings, <m2>each of their centuries</m2> being the single strongest thread that held it together, not for its entire length and width, but almost. #p#They did so with <m3>two ODI centuries that showed off the tones of the 50-over game</m3> making its cheerful Twenty20 cousin appear a little monotone. There were no bravado shots, no unnecessary risk-taking, just two batsmen who sized up where they were, what they were up against and then went about everything with precision. Every warp could he handled because Strauss and Tendulkar stayed true to the fundamental weft of their batting. <m4>Both centuries</m4> contained an evolved intelligence of design. Their embroidery didn't contain flourish. Its beauty lay in its simplicity and its intention. #p#To use a posh word, it was just too darn classy. #p#First to Strauss, because he batted second. Always under the cosh, in a match where defeat would have set about the shivers, in a stadium rooting against him, in conditions regarded as alien, against a bowling attack cobbled together to do just this sort of job in these kind of game. At the innings break, Strauss said he had told his team, "Lads, that's an unbelievably flat wicket, we can chase this" #p#It is one thing to concede 292 against Netherlands and chase, and quite another to do so against India at home. The chase was done, Strauss said, in exactly the same way as they had against Netherlands, milking singles (<m5>he scored 80 runs in ones and twos</m5>), "and taking on the odd boundary in the middle. It's the sort of chase that gives you a lot of confidence as a batting unit that you can chase down anything." #p#Take away <m6>Strauss's 158</m6> and the nine other Englishmen who batted on Sunday night, scored 180 between them. Take away his partner <m7>Ian Bell's 69</m7> and that calculation becomes even worse. Strauss considers his highest ODI score, from only his sixth century, his best-ever innings in the format. He had thrown everything into it - mind, body and soul - and did not allow it to be anything else. On Saturday afternoon, he had said that England were far better players of spin than they used to be and <m8>his partnership with Bell</m8> was the proof. #p#<m9>Strauss scored 107 runs off the 98 balls he faced from the Indian spinners</m9>, reading length and leaping onto his back foot against them with confidence. <m10>He reverse-swept Pathan on one occasion</m10> and <m11>stepped out and struck Yuvraj Singh over long-on, the six carrying both distance and impact</m11>. <m12>Bell scored 49 in 51 off the four Indian slow bowlers</m12>, Strauss saying that his innings had been just the hand England required. "You need to be scoring freely from both ends when you are chasing that many and he (Bell) did that from ball one." #p#A few hours before all that, <m13>Tendulkar had just been Tendulkar, racking up his 47th ODI century</m13> and extending his World Cup tally to five in six tournaments. Those numbers may sound monotonous but they bring with it a level of consistency Tendulkar has acquired in the ODI game, as if he has found himself a tool to help him do so. It's a bit like Adam Gilchrist and his 2007 squash ball, except for Tendulkar the piece of equipment, he uses, is his mind. In Bangalore, <m14>he struck the first boundary in the ninth over</m14> and <m15>his first six came in the 18th</m15>, yet his tempo never waned. He had Gautam Gambhir and Yuvraj Singh to keep pace with him and they gave India the chance to reach a total which, ideally, should have set them up to win the match. #p#What both Tendulkar and Strauss managed was to be themselves in a situation that could have muddled the minds of the less assured and taken apart the structure of the less skilled. Tendulkar was the calculative aggressor, batting amidst a wave of sound from tens of thousands of throats carrying him along. Strauss was modern classicist, in his own skin in the short game, thoughtful, methodical, his assurance, turning the noise into a tense hush. #p#After the game, Geoffrey Boycott said the match had showed up every reason why 50-over cricket needed to be loved: "It helps craftsmen play." #p#Tendulkar and Strauss today were craftsmen of the highest calibre who used the time they had at the crease to show their team-mates, and the crowd watching, how an ODI innings was meant to be planned, paced and constructed. After the craftsmen were gone, the purpose of both teams' turned to pudding. India got knotted up at the end of its innings and England came close to unravelling in a heap. #p#After the efforts of <m16>two centurions</m16> whom old Rome would have been proud to call their own, <m17>it was only fair that everything tied up neatly</m17>.
11	503411	India v England, World Cup 2011, Group B, Bangalore	England show they belong at the top	Dileep Premachandran in Bangalore	February 27, 2011	#p#Played 17, won 5. It's the sort of record you'd associate with a minnow, not with a team that was the only one to reach the semifinal or better in each of the first five World Cups. Since the run to the final in 1992 though, England have been abysmal, registering just five victories against Test-playing opposition in four competitions. Even those wins came against teams that were in disarray and had little chance of going all the way - like Sri Lanka in 1999 and Pakistan in 2003. #p#Against the better sides, England made up the numbers, much like a Canada or Kenya. An entire generation of fans has grown up thinking of English one-day cricket as a joke, unaware of Ian Botham's allround heroics in Australia in '92 or of Graham Gooch's 115-run masterclass that plunged India into depression in '87. #p#Journalists, like most who tell a story, love to embellish, to imbue events and situations with an importance they don't always deserve. In Bangalore on Sunday night, there was no need for exaggeration. What they saw was a colossal innings, one that will almost certainly result in England being taken seriously as a one-day side again. #p#Not many teams hunt down 339, but the way England started it quickly became apparent that they were going to have a good old joust. India were fortunate that <m1>Kevin Pietersen's superb cameo didn't last longer</m1>, and the video analyst will have a field day tomorrow pointing out the number of deliveries angled in at Andrew Strauss's pads. #p#This was only <m2>Strauss's sixth one-day century</m2>, and he has nothing like the repertoire of a Tendulkar or Pietersen. What he does possess is a quality Test opener's biggest asset - the ability to put away the bad ball. The more India bowled, the more fluently <m3>he and Ian Bell</m3> put them away. #p#<m4>Andrew Strauss's magnificent 158</m4> led England's chase and was the latest example of how their one-day game has moved on. Getty Images Enlarge #p#Had they been more used to winning, the result would have been different. Under MS Dhoni, India have a resilience about them no matter how badly they play, and once <m5>Zaheer exhibited that with a wonderful final spell</m5>, the doubts in English minds came to the fore. #p#"It was always going to be tough to chase that sort of total," said Strauss afterwards, his expression similar to that a man would have if he'd arranged a limo to pick up his date and seen her leave in a pick-up with the mechanic. "<m6>We just needed to have a good Powerplay</m6> and we were there." #p#<m7>They lost four wickets for 25 in those five overs</m7>, and a walk in the park became a Zimmer-frame lurch for the line. But with the middle order having imploded, they found unlikely heroes at the death. <m8>Graeme Swann and Tim Bresnan smeared Piyush Chawla for sixes</m8>, and <m9>Ajmal Shahzad produced the shot of the day when Munaf Patel pitched one too full in the final over</m9>. #p#<m10>Shahzad had shown strength of character earlier in the day, conceding just 27 in his first six overs</m10> even as India threatened to run away with the game. <m11>His next two went for 26</m11>, and spoke of over-exuberance and desperation to impose his will on the game. "We're very excited about him as a cricketer," said Strauss. "He runs in, is enthusiastic and has a great attitude. He got his chance because Broad was unwell, and he didn't let anyone down." #p#<m12>The 28 that England scored in the last two overs</m12> went hand-in-hand with <m13>the collapse that Bresnan inspired with a brilliant late spell where he both hit the deck and found the blockhole</m13>. <m14>India lost their last seven wickets for 34</m14>, and a possible 370 became 338. #p#Instead of heading back to the dressing room beaten and deflated, Bresnan's last burst allowed England to hope. Having managed to stem one Indian tide, they could conceive of taking toll of a bowling attack that had struggled to rein in Bangladesh. "Our bowling can be better than it was today, but I thought we finished the 50 overs very well," said Strauss, harking back to the moment when victory became a remote option. #p#He reckoned that most teams would have struggled to contain runs on "an incredibly flat wicket", but the fact remains that both teams lacked the bowling depth of a South Africa or Australia. <m15>James Anderson could have had Sehwag thrice in his first over</m15>, but bowled like a drain thereafter, while <m16>each of India's bowlers had at least one spell where they took a pounding</m16>. #p#"Both teams will take stock and we'll both say that we can go on and play better," said Strauss. "For now, I think we should celebrate that it was an unbelievable game of cricket, a great advert for the 50-over game." #p#We should also recognise the fact that England, after more than decade, are back at the top table. They may not be the most likely ones, but they're contenders again, thanks to a captain who keeps talking up his opening partner while doing the star turns himself.
11	503413	India v England, World Cup 2011, Group B, Bangalore	Strauss and Bresnan make it special for England	S Rajesh	February 27, 2011	<m1>Tim Bresnan took five wickets at an economy rate of 4.80</m1> when all the other bowlers struggled. Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Report : Epic encounter ends in thrilling tie Players/Officials: Tim Bresnan | Andrew Strauss | Sachin Tendulkar Matches: India v England at Bangalore Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: England | India #p#In a match which set the record for the most runs in a World Cup game, one bowler deserves a mention upfront, before the focus shifts to all the batting records: <m2>Tim Bresnan took his maiden five-for, and finished with an economy rate of 4.80 runs per over</m2> while the average for the entire match was almost two runs more than that. <m3>The next-best bowler in terms of economy rate from either side was Harbhajan Singh, with 5.80</m3>. No other bowler went at less than a run a ball, with one, <m4>James Anderson, conceding the most runs</m4> in his ODI career. (He has conceded 91 in an innings twice within a month, after never having conceded more than 86 in his ODI career before this; it was also the first time in seven ODIs in India that he managed to take a wicket.) #p#That said, it was still a game that will be remembered for all the batting landmarks. The total runs scored in the match was 676, which is the highest in a World Cup match, going past the previous record of 671 when Australia played South Africa in Bassaterre in 2007. On that occasion Australia contributed 377 and South Africa 294. #p#England will look back on the game as one in which they let slip an opportunity to win. They still finished with their highest World Cup score, going past their 334 against the same opponents way back in 1975. That they almost registered the highest successful World Cup run-chase was due to <m5>a magnificent 158 by Andrew Strauss</m5>, his highest ODI score, and easily one of the best ODI innings played by an England batsman. It was the sixth-highest in a run-chase, and England rode on that effort to make the highest second-innings total in World Cups. In fact, three of the four highest scores stand in their name, and two of those have come within a week. #p#There were two high-class centuries in the match, but given the context of the game, <m6>Sachin Tendulkar's innings</m6> was overshadowed by <m7>Strauss' century</m7>. <m8>Tendulkar became the most prolific hundred-maker in World Cup</m8> history, but <m9>Strauss, with his highest ODI score and his maiden World Cup ton</m9>, brought England back to life when all looked lost. <m10>Strauss scored the bulk of the runs in the first five overs</m10>, and then scored consistently throughout the innings, never allowing the asking rate to go out of control. #p#<m11>Tendulkar scored 28 in his first 47 balls</m11>, allowing Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir to do the bulk of the early scoring, before taking charge himself. It was the best strategy for the team, but <m12>Strauss kept up with the asking rate superbly, scoring 47 from his first 47 balls</m12>, and then slowly raising the tempo. His dot-ball percentage was much lower than Tendulkar, which shows how well he manoeuvred the ball around. Overall too, England played far fewer dot balls than India (see vital stats at the bottom of the page). #p#Break-ups of the hundreds by Strauss and Tendulkar Batsman Runs Balls Run rate Dot balls 4s/ 6s Andrew Strauss 158 145 6.53 55 (37.93%) 18/ 1 Sachin Tendulkar 120 115 6.26 57 (49.57%) 10/ 5 #p#In the end, though, <m13>England will be thankful for the 35 runs off 20 balls that Bresnan, Ajmal Shahzad and Graeme Swann contributed</m13>.

Getty Images Enlarge Related Links News : ICC tweaks 2.5 metre DRS rule for 'consistency'. News : Canada 'boggled' by DRS decisions. News : Smith fine with 2.5m rule. News : Bell stumped by his UDRS reprieve. In Focus: Technology in cricket Audio/Video: Boycott: 'Umpires at fault, not the DRS'. Players/Officials: Ian Bell | MS Dhoni | Yuvraj Singh Matches: India v England at Bangalore Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: England | India #p#India don't like the UDRS and one moment during the thrilling World Cup group match against England in Bangalore will have given them even more reason to distrust the technology when <m2>Ian Bell survived an lbw referral</m2>. It left MS Dhoni cursing the system as he called it an adulteration of human decision making and technlogy. #p#<m3>At the start of the 25th over of their gargangtuan run-chase, England were coasting more than 20 ahead of India in comparison.</m3> <m4>Then Yuvraj Singh struck Bell, who was stretching foward attempting one of those adventurous paddle sweeps, on the pad but umpire Billy Bowden turned down the appeal.</m4> The Indians did what they have been avoiding doing for more than two years - turn to the decision review. #p#The slow motion replay showed up on the giant screen and to the naked eye it met with most criteria: not a no ball, hitting in line of the stumps and striking the wicket. The crowd roared with delight expecting Bell to be on his way and he had already begun his dejected trek back, supposedly out for 17 to complete another unfullfilled one-day innings. #p#Until, that is, his captain began to holler him to a halt halfway to the dressing room. The last criteria that was showing up on the screen indicated the distance that the ball would have to travel from point of impact to the stumps was more than 2.5 metres, a rule most on the ground did not know about. Not even England. #p#The 2.5m rule has been put into place because it is from that point onwards that the precision of the ball tracking technology begins to reduce. That last piece of information was conveyed to Bowden by the third umpire and he stuck to his original decision. Not out. Too far down the pitch. #p#Dhoni was far from amused, finding it difficult to accept that both technology and human intervention played a part in coming to the decision which <m5>allowed Bell to survive</m5> and make another 52 runs. "Adulteration is quite bad, whether it is natural or technology," he said. "I think the adulteration of technology with human intention was the reason why we didn't get that wicket. Hopefully next time, it will be [either] technology or human intention [in the UDRS]." #p#The 2.5m ruling surprised most of the players, the England captain Andrew Strauss being informed about it during the review itself. "Apparently if you are that far down the pitch it needs to be hitting middle stump to be given out. I didn't know that was part of the rules," he said. "Obviously Belly was lucky to get away with it." #p#When he was asked whether he had known about the 2.5m rule Dhoni didn't hide his frustration. "Well, if the Hawkeye says it is going to hit the stump, and it's going to hit the middle stump, then [there is] no reason why the distance really matters," he said. #p#He went on to recall a dismissal of his own when he had stepped outside his crease and was given lbw after he was hit on the shin. "UDRS was not there...If I can be given out, why not other batsmen? So whether it is 2.5m or 2.4 or 2.6, it is pretty difficult for me. What I saw was the ball hitting the stump. After that, the rest of the rule book is rested with the third and the fourth umpire. Whatever they decided, we said, 'Okay, whatever they decide, we get on with the game'." #p#The ICC playing conditions relating to this part of the system come under Process of Consultation No. 3.3 (i). It states that if a 'not out' decision is being reviewed and the distance from impact to the stumps is greater than 2.5m then the third umpire passes this information to the on-field official along with: the distance from the wickets of the point of impact with the batsman, the approximate distance from the point of pitching to the point of impact, and whether the ball is predicted to the hit the stumps. #p#The playing condition goes onto state that: "In such a case the on-field umpire shall have regard to the normal cricketing principles concerning the level of certainty in making his decision as to whether to change his decision."
11	503491			Richard Kemp		<m1>Ajmal Shehzad delivered the "wow moment" of the day</m1>. &copy; AFP Enlarge Related Links --> --> Players/Officials: Andrew Strauss | Sachin Tendulkar Matches: India v England at Bangalore Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: England | India #p# Choice of game. I'm following England throughout the group games in India, so attending the game against the main host nation was a must - this despite the hassle and cost of changing flights and accommodation after the switch from Kolkata to Bangalore. After England's poor start against the Dutch in Nagpur, I couldn't see any other result than an Indian win. More so once <m2>India racked up 338</m2>! #p# Team supported. Naturally the England boys. #p# World Cup prediction. On paper India are the strongest outfit. If they handle the growing pressure as the tournament progresses then they will be tough to beat on home soil. Sri Lanka will be there or thereabouts but may just lack that "x-factor" with the bat to challenge during the latter stages. Pakistan have started well but over the seven weeks are bound to have some form of chaos surround their squad, which could affect their chances of going all the way. My outside bet would be on Australia, who have a dangerous pace attack that could unsettle any batting line-up. Their test will be if they play one of the big boys on a slow, low turner, neutralising the danger of Lee, Tait and Super Mitch. If they can show they can adapt then they have a shout. Despite the tie against the Indians, I think this tournament will be one step too far for our Ashes and Twenty20 winning heroes. We just look like we are lacking a bit of energy in the field, no doubt brought on by the long winter away. Whether tonight's run-chase will boost the side at all remains to be seen. #p# Accessories. Naturally a wallet full of Indian rupees to ensure I got my daily dose of samosas, plus a digital camera which was smuggled in between my legs, defying ridiculous rules banning any photography equipment. #p# Key performer. Andrew Strauss. No doubt Sachin Tendulkar will take all the plaudits in the Indian newspapers, but <m3>it was Strauss who played the more telling knock</m3>. Many questioned his ability to bat at the top of the order on the subcontinent, taking advantage of the fielding restrictions before milking the bowling in the middle periods. <m4>This innings of 158</m4>, delivered on the biggest possible stage, should silence any remaining doubters. <m5>His fourth hundred for England in India</m5> and arguably his most memorable. Tim Bresnan and Zaheer Khan both bowled crucial spells at the death, but it was Strauss's that was the standout display in <m6>a thrilling tie</m6>. #p# One thing I'd have changed. From a purely selfish point of view it would have been great to see England eke out that extra single off the last ball. Upon reflection a tie was probably a fair result. Both sides batted superbly for the majority of the game before the bowlers hit back in the last 10 overs. #p# Face-off I relished. Any game against India that involves Yuvraj Singh is always worth watching. The England boys believe they can get into Yuvraj with the odd word. Judging by his continuing excellent form against England, I'm not sure that is the best tactic! #p# Wow moment. <m7>Ajmal Shehzad struck the first ball he faced for a maximum over long-on</m7>. Sheer drama after over seven hours of brilliant ODI cricket. The England fans congregated in the imaginatively titled "Calcutta Stand" knew we wouldn't lose after this incredible moment. #p# Shot of the day. Wow, how do you choose that after 676 runs? From a purely cricketing point of view I'd say <m8>Tendulkar's second six in two balls against Graeme Swann</m8>. Anyone can hit one six, but to do it twice in a row against one of the world's best bowlers in the middle period of a ODI oozes class. A proper shot too, hit straight down the ground. #p# Crowd meter. The noise towards the end of the game, when India started chipping away at wickets was as loud as anything I have heard in a cricket ground anywhere in the world. It would have been even louder were it not for the several thousand who left early during <m9>the Strauss-Bell partnership</m9>. #p# Fancy-dress index. As ever, my good friend Dave was kitted out in his full Union Jack attire. Apart from the odd silly wig, the crowd was in the main shy of the usual fancy-dress suspects. #p# Entertainment. As it should be, the cricket was the main entertainment. Forget your IPL cheerleaders (this isn't baseball) plus your music in between deliveries. Just let the cricketers do their stuff. #p# Banner of the day. "Thank you Calcutta". At least the people of Bangalore gained from the late rearrangement to the fixture. #p# ODIs v Twenty20. I'm not a huge fan of what Twenty20 has become. It was originally launched domestically as a tool for getting people back into cricket. Sadly the greed of the cricket boards is slowly killing the golden goose. For me Twenty20 should never have been taken into the international arena in the first place - we have enough Test and ODI cricket as it is. If I had to choose, I would say ODIs. A good ODI is more memorable than a good Twenty20. If ever there was an example of that, it was this incredible game. #p# Marks out of 10. 10. Superb entertainment from the first ball to the last. #p# Overall. A brilliant day's cricket that sets the benchmark for the rest of the tournament. I've already been fortunate to witness both Tendulkar and Strauss score Test hundreds in India. Now I can add ODI tons for good measure. Some fine death bowling followed by some late-order hitting completed the near-perfect day.

Players/Officials: Ian Bell | Billy Bowden Matches: India v England at Bangalore Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: England | India #p#Ian Bell has conceded that he was as baffled as anyone when he benefited from <m2>a controversial decision review</m2> in <m3>England's tie with India on Sunday</m3>. <m4>Bell was given not out by umpire Billy Bowden but the bowler Yuvraj Singh was certain he had trapped the batsman lbw, and convinced the captain MS Dhoni to ask for a review.</m4> #p#<m5>The process was played out on the big screen at the Chinnaswamy Stadium and when the fans saw the ball had struck Bell in line and was going on to hit the stumps, a roar went around and Bell began to walk off. However, Bell was turned back by the fourth umpire Aleem Dar, who was sitting on the sidelines and knew that Bowden was sticking to his decision.</m5> #p#Bell was more than 2.5 metres down the pitch when he was struck, and from that distance the Hawkeye tracking technology is considered to be less reliable, so the on-field umpire can decide to trust the computer or stick to his own eye. The spectators had no idea why the decision was upheld, and began chanting "cheating", while Dhoni said after the game it was an adulteration of human decision-making and technology. #p#"When a decision gets reviewed, you can see everything as it unfolds on the big screen," Bell said the next morning. "When I saw it pitch in line and hit the stumps, I thought that was it. I wasn't aware of the rule of how far you had to be down the wicket. I got waved back on by the fourth official and I moved on from there. I wasn't aware that the distance down the wicket was a factor. #p#"I didn't even know that rule existed. As soon as I saw it pitch in line and hit, I thought that was enough. It's strange, to be honest with you, if you see Hawkeye saying it's going to hit the stumps. It's a little bit strange. But that's the rule, I guess, and we're not going to be able to change that for this World Cup." #p#Although the rule was news to Bell, it had been seen during England's recent ODI series against Australia. In the seventh and final match at the WACA, the Australian batsman Tim Paine was adjudged not out to Liam Plunkett, and England reviewed the umpire Paul Reiffel's on-field decision. #p#The replays showed Paine was hit more than 2.5 metres from the stumps, but Hawkeye suggested the ball would have crashed into the stumps halfway up, and on that occasion Reiffel decided not to argue with the technology, even though he would have been within his rights to stay with his not-out call. #p#Bowden didn't feel the same way on Sunday, and the decision contributed to an epic tie that came down to the final ball of the 50th over, as England nearly pulled off a mammoth chase. Despite not taking full points from the game, Bell said England could take plenty of confidence from their efforts against a strong Indian side. #p#"I think we can take a hell of a lot from it," Bell said. "Going in halfway chasing 338, I don't think too many England teams in the past over here would have done that. I've certainly played in a fair share myself where we wouldn't have got 250 runs chasing that. #p#"To do that and to be involved in this one-day side showed me the strides forward we've made as a team. If we can keep doing that, we've got the quality in bowling that when we get our bowling and fielding 100% right we're going to be a good team in this competition."
11	503545	India v England, World Cup 2011, Group B, Bangalore	We can't improve our fielding much - Dhoni	ESPNcricinfo staff	February 28, 2011	#p#India captain, MS Dhoni, has admitted his team fielded poorly against England, but said there were limits to how much it could improve its fielding. Instead, he said, the team needed to focus on its strengths. #p#"Maybe if we would have fielded slighted better, we would have won the game by one run because you realise in these games the importance of one run," Dhoni said. "I don't think we can improve the fielding very much because we have got quite a few slow fielders in the side. #p#"So I think if we were a different fielding side it would have been slightly better, but then you need to realise your strengths and definitely fielding is not a big part of it." #p#Apart from <m1>a dropped chance off Andrew Strauss early in his innings</m1> and <m2>one off Ian Bell at slip</m2>, India conceded quite a few runs by way of misfields. #p#<m3>The hosts amassed 338</m3> on the backs of <m4>another Sachin Tendulkar century</m4> on Sunday in Bangalore, but <m5>Strauss made a century of his own</m5> and the match ended in <m6>a dramatic tie</m6> after <m7>some lusty lower-order hitting from England</m7>. During England's innings, Dhoni was seen discussing fielding and bowling changes on a number of occasions with Virender Sehwag. #p#<m8>Munaf Patel took a clever return catch to dismiss Kevin Pietersen</m8>, rare bright moment for India in the field. AFP Enlarge #p#"If you are not 100% sure of something, you have got experienced players in the side whom you can always approach because at the end of the day the motivation is to take the best decision at the right time. That's what I was interacting with him since he was close to me." #p#Dhoni said he likes to let his bowlers choose their own field and it is only when things don't go to plan that he steps in. "I always give the liberty to the bowlers to set the field," he said. "If the fast bowler wants a particular field, even if i am not very happy with it, I believe in the skill of the fast bowlers, and give him the first preference to pick his own field. If it is not successful, then I implement my own field."
11	503620	World Cup 2011	Bresnan's brilliance marks return of England's fire	Andrew Miller	February 28, 2011	Tim Bresnan was superb in a batsman-dominated game. Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: Tim Bresnan | Andrew Strauss Matches: India v England at Bangalore Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: England | India #p#The players' emotions at the end of a pulsating contest were shredded, but one man's grimace told the tale of the tape as far England's post-match debrief will be concerned. Amid the hugs, shrugs, smiles and dislocated sense of occasion, Andy Flower's face wore the wan look of a man who knew a massive opportunity had been allowed to slip away. #p#England had history in their grasp on Sunday night in Bangalore, and a one-day powerhouse at their mercy. Although they contrived to win the contest twice - first through the clarity of their captain's strokeplay, and then through the gutsiness of their tail-end escape plan - they lost it so badly in between whiles that a share of the spoils was the only fair result. #p#In the final analysis it may not matter at all. In the peculiarly protracted format that's been chosen for this World Cup, only those teams who really make a meal of the group stages will be going home early - and if ever there was an opponent against whom England's strategists would have budgeted for nil point , it was the hosts and World Cup favourites, India. #p#And yet, there's more at stake for England than mere subsistence in the coming weeks. That they have performed like paupers in the past four editions of the World Cup might give them reason to think that a spirited show of competence will suffice this time around, but that's not how Flower of all people played his cricket, and it's not how he plots it now. He's in it to win it, and nothing less will do. An astonishing spectacle was served up in Bangalore on Sunday, but satisfaction was thin on the ground among the main protagonists. #p#It perhaps epitomises England's missed opportunity that two of their players will struggle to improve on their performances at Bangalore - not just in this World Cup but for the rest of their one-day careers. <m1>Andrew Strauss's 158</m1> was an astonishingly rounded innings from a player who was pigeonholed as a Test specialist at the end of the last World Cup, but has now scored nearly 2000 runs in the two years since his ODI recall. That he beat Sachin Tendulkar to the Man-of-the-Match award, and that there were not howls of protestation from a fevered crowd, says it all about a performance that will struggle to be bettered this year. #p#However, as James Anderson later pointed out in a "batter's game" grumble on Twitter, the worthier recipient would arguably have been <m2>Tim Bresnan, who scalped Sehwag in his first over</m2>, <m3>claimed three wickets in four balls in his last</m3>, and was the only bowler on a night of extraordinary strokeplay who displayed the range of skills required to be a threat in all phases of a 50-over innings, and the expertise to execute them on demand. #p#In a game consisting of 676 runs, <m4>Bresnan's feat of five wickets at 4.8 an over</m4> was outstanding, as he extrapolated the lessons he learned during England's triumphant Twenty20 campaign, and made sure he treated every single delivery as an event in its own right. "All career you work on it, and you deliver under pressure because that what you're trained to do," was his modest self-appraisal on the morning after the match. #p#The lessons learned against the Dutch were many and varied, but two stood out in England's performance against India. Firstly, it ain't over 'til the 50 overs are done; secondly, towering run-chases are feasible on Indian wickets #p#All the same, <m5>the manner in which he silenced a rampant Sehwag was superb, as he limited him to two runs in four balls before luring a dab to the keeper</m5>, and of <m6>the 60 deliveries that he bowled in the innings</m6>, <m7>a mere two - both to Tendulkar - resulted in shots for which he could be deemed culpable</m7>. His downbeat demeanour means he'll rarely be anything other than under-estimated, but after a starring role in the Ashes decider at Melbourne, and now this, he'll do well to remain unrecognised for long. #p#And that's before you even factor in the manner in which Bresnan fronted up with his second string, as his belligerent brand of Yorkshire thwacking launched the second wave of England's victory push. <m8>He was later reprimanded by the ICC for smacking his stumps after being bowled by Piyush Chawla</m8>, but <m9>the more significant blow was the straight six he had belted off the previous ball of the over</m9>, to reduce the requirement from 20 to 14, and make possible the madcap antics of <m10>the game's final over</m10>. #p#Though <m11>victory eluded them</m11>, the good news for England is that they've set about banishing the bad vibes from their wretched one-day series in Australia. There was never much danger of that campaign lingering long in the mind's eye - barely a month has passed but already the details are hazy beyond the 6-1 scoreline - but the wider concern was the damage such a slack-witted itinerary would have done to the razor-sharp competitiveness that England had honed in the build-up to the Ashes. #p#<m12>Andrew Strauss's 158</m12> was arguably England's finest ODI innings. Getty Images Enlarge #p#A scratchy warm-up victory over Canada and an even dicier display against the Dutch did not augur well for the greater challenges that lay ahead, but true to their protestations during their three-day stop-over in London, England really did find a way to turn on the intensity when it mattered. Some have taken rather longer than Strauss and Bresnan to locate their A games and run with them (and one man, Anderson, is still searching rather forlornly) but there's no questioning the competitive fires that still burn within this set of players. #p#No-one quite believed it at the time, but that Netherlands hurry-up turned out to be the perfect preparation for England. In Australia, defeat had been allowed to become endemic, but the mitigating circumstances were so widespread, and the interest in the series so minimal, that humiliation was simply off the agenda. The prospect of failing on the world stage against a bunch of Dutch part-timers, however, was so unpalatable, it was arguably the greatest incentive they had encountered since their Ashes-levelling defeat in Perth back in December. #p#The lessons learned in Nagpur were many and varied, but two stood out in England's performance against India. Firstly, it ain't over 'til the 50 overs are done, whether that's in the field or with the bat. Against the Dutch, with a wave of helplessness sweeping over them as Ryan ten Doeschate's innings gathered late momentum, England looked, mentally, as though they'd already uprooted the stumps and fled the scene with six overs remaining. A spectacular rash of errors - fumbles, beamers, positional transgressions - filled the void where their professional standards had previously been. #p#On Sunday, however, those closing overs were an entirely different story. England should by rights have been facing a total at least equal to the 370 that Bangladesh conceded to Virender Sehwag and Virat Kohli in Dhaka, or maybe even the 387 that Yuvraj Singh created in the first match of the 5-0 whitewash in 2008-09. Instead they remembered to keep their shape despite the pummelling they were receiving, and through the skill of <m13>Bresnan's yorkers</m13>, they scalped <m14>seven wickets in 25 balls</m14>. #p#The second lesson was that towering run-chases are feasible on Indian wickets. "The pitch is flat, let's beat them" was the gist of Strauss's team-talk, and again, it was precisely because England had no option but to save face against the Dutch that they went out and gave it their best shot - and in so doing, they realised the task was actually easier than perhaps they'd believed it could be. Had any other team put 292 on the board against a side coming off the back of a 6-1 series defeat, it would have been far easier to take refuge in nearly-but-not-quites. Just as England have been doing in one-day cricket for 16 years, in fact. #p#Collectively, England remain a flawed outfit, and since the injury to Eoin Morgan, they have had issues of balance that may yet prove fatal in their bid for the ultimate prize. Ravi Bopara's batting might have made the difference had he been selected against India, though <m15>Paul Collingwood's cutters</m15> are an asset that England will not cast aside lightly. Meanwhile Stuart Broad's stomach upset was as untimely as his stomach tear during the Ashes. But from what we've witnessed so far in this competition, they are willing and able to dig deep in the face of adversity. #p#And that is as it should be, because for a hard taskmaster such as Flower, there's always more shovelling to be done.
11	503768	World Cup 2011	ICC bats for its 2.5-metre rule	Sharda Ugra in Bangalore	March 1, 2011	<m1>MS Dhoni asks for a review after Ian Bell was given not out in the game against England in Bangalore</m1>. Getty Images Enlarge Related Links News : Smith fine with 2.5m rule. In Focus: Technology in cricket. Players/Officials: MS Dhoni Matches: India v England at Bangalore Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: India #p#The controversial clause in the Decision Review System (DRS) that reprieved Ian Bell during the tense England run-chase against India in Bangalore was introduced into the rules because of players' doubts over the accuracy of the ball tracker technology. Speaking to ESPNcricinfo in Bangalore, ICC chief executive, Haroon Lorgat, said, "The rules and protocols for DRS were designed by experts with much thought. The Bell example applies the 2.5m rule which, in my view, accommodates the scepticism that some have with predictive technonolgy." #p#India's scepticism about the DRS has grown following <m2>the incident involving Bell, the first time the team asked for a referral in the World Cup</m2>. <m3>Television replays, which were displayed on the giant screen of the M Chinnaswamy Stadium, appeared to show that the ball had hit a forward-stretching Bell low on the pad with the ball in line with middle stump. Bell had begun to walk off, but umpire Billy Bowden did not declare him out because the distance between the point of impact and the stumps was shown to be 2.5m.</m3> #p#MS Dhoni criticised the Bell decision, calling it an 'adulteration' of technology with human judgement, but Lorgat said it was not an accurate description of what transpired. "It's absolutely not (adulteraton) - as it is there to support the umpire, not to overrule the umpire. The whole purpose of DRS is to avoid the error, not to seek a wicket or to reprieve a batsman. That's not the purpose of the system, the purpose is to avoid an error that would result in gross injustice. The Bell decision was a judgement call for the umpire - if he didn't have the DRS, we would have been arguing about how far down the pitch the batsman was. What we are trying to avoid through DRS is the bad decision, not to adjudicate on decisions that could go either way. #p#Using the DRS in the World Cup, Lorgat said was, "to simply avoid the shocking error that can happen. And we do not want such errors in the World Cup." Umpires he said would acknowledge this, he said, adding they were, "happy" with the DRS. "They can go to sleep at night knowing that had they made that one mistake, it can be rectified. That would not have happened without DRS." #p#The rule about the distance between impact and the stumps had been put in place precisely because experts had said that the accuracy of the ball tracker - in this case Hawk Eye - begins to falter from that point. "In other words if the ball needed to travel more than 2.5m, then it is for the umpire to make the final decision as he sees it." #p#Dhoni had asked why the mark had not been stipulated at 2.4, or 2.6m, and Lorgat said that while, "You can set that mark wherever you want - Dhoni was saying 2.4 and 2.6 - but the experts have decided on 2.5 m, after which the umpire and not technology decides.." #p#ICC General Manager, Dave Richardson, told Indian news channel, CNN-IBN , that Dhoni should be aware of the rules before passing judgement. "There are a set of rules along with the Hawk-Eye to assist in making the decision when UDRS is implemented... Most of the time, a player is not fully aware of all the rules. If MS Dhoni is made aware of the specifications of these rules, then I am sure that he will accept the decision that was made." #p#"If MS Dhoni is made aware of the specifications of these rules, then I am sure that he will accept the decision that was made." #p#Lorgat went on to say that regardless of the technology, the umpire had remained at the front and center of decision making on the field. "The umpire still has the authority to say, despite what I've heard and seen, I still don't think that is enough reason for me to change my decision. It is for them to decide. That [DRS] has aided them, that does not overrule the umpire. That is a support structure we have put in place." #p#When asked whether the DRS would now be a constant in ODIs following the World Cup, Lorgat said, "No. A comprehensive review and recommendation can only be decided once the ICC Cricket Committee deliberates in May 2011. You can't deny the progress of technology, either we embrace it or we reject it. I believe we reject it at our own peril." #p#The DRS was met with a lot of resistance when it was first introduced in 2008, but it has now enjoys what Lorgat calls a, "lot more support" across all Test playing countries other than India. Lorgat said, "Now, people are asking us, "Why is it not mandatory?" It is currently not because of the lack of available technology. We would also want all players and Match Officials to experience and embrace it fully." He said there were, "commercial and contractual aspects related to its application" which is why the ICC had left the decision, "to the participating Boards." #p#The system had come into play in the World Cup because it was an ICC event but leaving it to bilateral boards was not unfair on the part of those countries which have embraced it, "This (the World Cup) is an ICC event and the ICC has decided to use it. In the case of bilateral series it is up to the Members to decide. Some claim this is not consistent and therefore not fair. I don't believe so as the playing conditions would be the same for the two competing teams and it is still the subject of the umpire deciding." #p#Lorgat said the DRS was, "no more than a tool" to help the decision making the umpire. "By using DRS, the correct decision making percentage has improved by around 5%, from 92% to 97%. With such improvement how can we not support its use?" #p#In the ICC's DRS rule pertaining to the Process of Consultation, No. 3.3 (i), states that if a 'not out' decision is being reviewed on the 'point of impact' issue, the third umpire must tell the onfield umpire whether the ball is past 2.5m or not and then pass on the following information: the distance from the wickets of the point of impact with the batsman, the approximate distance from the point of pitching to the point of impact, and whether the ball is predicted to the hit the stumps. According to the explanation given on the ICC's website, along with the 2.5m rule, should the distance between point of pitching and point of impact with the pad be less than 40cm, "the umpires are not obliged to follow the normal rules for using Hawkeye to determine whether the batsman is out or not and shall have a discretion in determining whether or not to overturn their original not out decision." #p#The ball tracker, like Hawk-Eye in this case, comes into play from the time the ball pitches and to the point of impact. That passage of information is then passed to the computer through multiple camera frames that help the tracker pick up on trajectory and make its assessment. The greater the distance between the point where the ball pitches and the point where it makes contact with either bat or pad, the more camera frames there are for the tracker to trace the predictive path. The shorter the distance, the less information is available to the technology to make an accurate prediction, which is why the 2.5m rule was brought into play. #p#<m4>The Bell-Bowden incident</m4> has raised the issue of whether the third umpire should be able to instruct the on-field umpire to change his decision, as opposed to merely passing on information. #p#The argument in favour says that the third umpire is the man who has both access and time to look at the replay and is also detached from the emotions on the field and in the crowd looking at the dismissal on a giant screen. The argument against states that giving the third umpire these powers will reduce the importance of the man in the middle.
11	503924		Grey is the colour of the DRS	Sambit Bal	March 3, 2011	What is more acceptable: errors by humans or those by machines? Getty Images Enlarge Related Links News : ICC tweaks 2.5 metre DRS rule for 'consistency'. News : Canada 'boggled' by DRS decisions. News : Smith fine with 2.5m rule. News : ICC bats for its 2.5-metre rule. News : Bell stumped by his UDRS reprieve. News : Dhoni angered by UDRS ruling. In Focus: Technology in cricket. Players/Officials: Ian Bell | MS Dhoni Matches: India v England at Bangalore Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: India #p#By some cosmic design, it was India's lot to be on the wrong end of one of the peculiarities of the Decision Review System (the "U" has been dropped in deference to the sentiments of the umpires) in the World Cup, to ignite the first umpiring controversy of the World Cup. #p#<m1>Ian Bell looked so out on the giant screen, he had started walking. Apparently none of the players - certainly neither MS Dhoni nor Andrew Strauss - were aware of the regulation that reprieved Bell, who was originally given not out to a leg-before appeal, a decision that was challenged by the Indians. Though the replays suggested the ball was heading towards middle stump, by rule this evidence wasn't deemed conclusive since the impact had been 2.5 metres down the wicket.</m1> #p#Do you have to read that all over again for it to make sense? #p#Now consider this: this regulation was apparently introduced on account of misgivings expressed about the tracking technology by the players. #p#Of course Dhoni should have known the rules, which are the same for every team, but his lament about the "adulteration of technology with human thinking" had a philosophical resonance to it. That it has led to a mild skirmish between the ICC and the BCCI is perhaps predictable, but it would be unfortunate if the issue snowballs into yet another instance of the Indian board trying to impose its might on global cricket. #p#It is ironic that the BCCI, and an influential section of Indian players, should be the biggest opponents of the review system, which owes its genesis to a few glaring errors in the Sydney Test in 2008, which a majority of Indians perceived as a miscarriage of justice. #p#And while it is unacceptable that the same form of the game should played under different regulations - as is done in Tests involving India, or those played in Pakistan, where the broadcaster is unable to afford the required technology - it shouldn't obscure the case that the DRS, which is still evolving, has some serious questions hanging over it. #p#For the sake of clarity it is important to consider a couple of basic issues. What is the fundamental objective of the system? If man and machine are both liable are produce controversies, which kind are we more prepared to live with? What is more acceptable: mistakes produced by machines from which expect perfection, or from men whose fallibility is like our own? #p#The answer to the first question is straightforward. The review system was introduced to eliminate howlers of the kind seen in Sydney. But what it has led to instead is random, whimsical, and on many occasions ludicrous, challenges based on hope, desperation and sometimes just for the sake of it. #p#Anyone who has played or followed cricket seriously will agree that players and fans feel most aggrieved when mistakes to do with edges are made. When crowds are noisy, umpires are genuinely disadvantaged in this regard. But yet, a majority of challenges, in this World Cup and otherwise, have involved leg-before decisions. In some cases, blatantly wrong decisions have been corrected, but many cases have been marginal. The fundamental truth is that, given the predictive nature of the decision, both players and fans, however aggrieved they may feel at the time, are willing allow some latitude to the umpire. The machines are yet to convince anyone that they can, in absolute terms, separate black from white. There are challenges from the conditions, equipment, the men who operate the machines, and the distance between the point of impact and the stumps. Once we accept that grey exists, both in the case of man and machine, it comes down to a question of percentages. And what's more acceptable: errors by human or errors by machines. #p#It's always been my case that the makers of the DRS have it wrong in entrusting the predictive part of decision-making to machines that can neither deliver absolute results nor convince anyone that they are foolproof. Instead of asking the players and the fans to take a leap of faith, the game will be better off if the review system is restricted to areas where incontrovertible evidence is available. Tennis, the only other sport that uses ball-tracking technology, bases the review on visual evidence. Cricket has long used the camera for other line decisions without any grief. So should it be for lbws: pitch mats can also go wrong if the cameras are not positioned right, but that is something that can be controlled. Limiting the review to where the ball pitched and the point of impact would take conjecture out of the equation. #p#As Nasser Hussain pointed out on television after the Ian Bell incident, Indian fans must figure out which side of the line they stand on: they can't support their team's scepticism about ball-tracking technology, and also use the projection provided by the same technology to fulminate against the Bell decision #p#Of course the matter is not so simple. Fans and the media will see the projections and judge the umpires by them. And fans and the media, and indeed the players themselves, can be notoriously fickle. As Nasser Hussain pointed out on television after the Ian Bell incident, Indian fans must figure out which side of the line they stand on: they can't, on the one hand, support their team's scepticism about ball-tracking technology, and on the other, use the projection provided by the same technology to fulminate against the Bell decision. #p#The DRS has many other problems too. HotSpot, the technology players seem to trust more, isn't available everywhere, and is so expensive that many broadcasters can't afford it. There is still no resolution about who should pay for the technology (the broadcasters are right in their stand that their obligation is to the television viewer, not the ICC). Catches close to the ground are impossible to judge with the camera. And most fundamentally, the system isn't designed to deliver justice for all (two injudicious reviews by his team-mates can deny a player the chance to seek justice for himself). #p#The final question the administrators must themselves is: do they want to make a complex game more complex? What is the use of creating a new set of complications in trying sort out old ones? Let's take this clause as an example of how muddled things can get: #p#3.6. Dead ball a) If following a Player Review request, an original decision of "Out" is changed to "Not Out", then the ball is still deemed to have become dead when the original decision was made (as per Law 23.1(a)(iii)). The batting side, while benefiting from the reversal of the dismissal, will not benefit from any runs that may subsequently have accrued from the delivery had the on-field umpire originally made a "Not Out" decision, other than any No Balls penalty that could arise under 3.3 (g) above. #p#But what happens if the ball crosses the boundary before the umpire decides to declare the batsman out, and the decision is then overturned to not out? Should the batting side then be denied legitimate runs? Or should, for sake of justice, the ball then be re-bowled, just as points are replayed in tennis? #p#The larger point is that the game can survive the odd mistake from the umpire. It faces far greater challenges with regard to the scheduling of the international calendar, on which the very future of the game depends, and in the shape of match-fixing, which threatens the integrity and the very soul of cricket.
11	504044		Timing the Powerplays right	Aakash Chopra	March 5, 2011	<m1>England's batting Powerplay</m1> went awry against India. ESPNcricinfo Ltd Enlarge Related Links Matches: India v England at Bangalore Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: England | India #p#The figures of <m2>England's batting Powerplay overs</m2> against India at the Chinnaswamy Stadium are baffling to say the least. Not only did <m3>they lose four wickets</m3> - <m4>three to India's wrecker-in-chief, Zaheer Khan</m4> - they suddenly looked dilapidated, <m5>notching up a meagre 25 runs</m5>. #p#Powerplays are deciding, or at least influencing, the outcome of most matches. Not just the batting Powerplay but the mandatory Powerplay at the beginning and the bowling Powerplay also demand attention. Well, why wouldn't they, for Powerplay overs take up 40% of the total overs. #p#The mandatory Powerplay overs. Going by the way things have shaped up over the first couple of weeks of the World Cup, it seems like we're back in the 1990s. Teams are treading with caution and are seldom willing to throw caution to the winds. While you'll always have a Sehwag to break this norm, it still remains an individual's choice and not necessarily a part of the team's strategy - unless the team is chasing over 300 runs. Scoring at 9-10 an over inside the first 10 is still an aberration, and the main culprit for this change in approach is the advent of Twenty20. Now you may think that Twenty20 should enhance risk-taking ability and quality of strokeplay, but while it may do these things, it also tells you that 50 overs is too long a game to get too eager too soon. The mantra is to keep wickets right till the end. #p#The bowling Powerplay Ever wondered why most teams take the bowling Powerplay straight after the first one? #p#Most teams play three seam-up bowlers and the third seamer comes into play between about the 9th and 15th overs, because it's wise to introduce a quick bowler when the ball is still relatively new and might swing or seam. Only if the batting side is going at 9-10 an over without losing a wicket, then you would wait for a wicket to fall to opt for the bowling Powerplay. The older the ball, the easier it becomes (unless the ball starts reversing) for the batsman to milk the medium-pace bowlers. #p#Another reason for taking the bowling Powerplay immediately after the first 10 is to give you enough time to pull back things, in case the opposition cashes in. The later you leave it, the less time you have to resurrect yourself. #p#The batting Powerplay The trickiest of them all. While this was introduced quite a while ago, no team can claim to have cracked its code. #p#Is it the timing or the approach that needs to be monitored? In my opinion, both are equally important. The ideal time to take the Powerplay is in the early 30s, provided you have two set batsmen in the middle. Teams must use these overs to build a momentum that will provide the platform for the final onslaught. Taking the Powerplay earlier would mean having to sustain the momentum for way too long, which might not be easy. Leaving it too late, like a lot of teams are doing by taking it in the 40s, may not give you enough time to build on the momentum. Also, if you take the Powerplay in the death overs, it's easier for the bowling unit, since they will have kept some overs of their best bowlers in hand till then. The idea is to employ the Powerplay to use up the five overs from the opposition's best bowlers early so that they need to resort to a lesser bowler during the death overs. Had England taken their Powerplay overs in the 30s, Zaheer may not have had enough overs left to come back towards the end. #p#The idea is to employ the Powerplay to use up the five overs from the opposition's best bowlers early so that they need to resort to a lesser bowler during the death overs #p#Now comes the approach. Most teams and batsmen feel obliged to go after the bowling after taking the batting Powerplay. While thinking along these lines is understandable, the results often leave a lot to be desired. In an attempt to up the ante batsmen are taking more risks than they can afford against the best opposition bowlers. More often than not batsmen find themselves in Catch 22 situations - they want to score quickly but don't have the license to get out. This lack of clarity in approach is leading to their downfall. #p#It makes things easier if the batsmen in the middle are well set. By set I don't mean both should have made 60 or more but they should have their eyes in and feet moving. I don't think it's mandatory to be in a situation where losing your wicket doesn't matter much. In fact, on the contrary, I'd take the Powerplay when the wicket matters both to the team and the batsman himself. If you haven't got the desired runs from the match, you would tread with a reasonable amount of caution. Playing proper cricket shots, while being prepared to go after balls pitched in your go-to area, is wiser. #p#It may not be a bad idea to set a realistic target of scoring 35-40 runs in the five overs. It's important to remember that Powerplay overs are as much about scoring quickly as about playing out the opposition's best bowlers. Also, it's wise to not approach them like the death overs, in which wickets don't matter, or like the first mandatory Powerplay overs, for bowlers have better control when the ball is old. #p#Finally, aren't these overs teaching fielding captains a thing or two? Dhoni knew that the only way to come into the match against England was by taking wickets, but still neither did he bring the field in nor actively seek to take wickets. Since bowlers are picking up lots of wickets consistently in the Powerplay overs, isn't it wise to be a bit more attacking most times, at least for your best bowlers? Why wait for the batting side to opt for the batting Powerplay to become attacking? That should be by default, not design.

Associated Press Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: Sachin Tendulkar | Virender Sehwag Matches: India v England at Bangalore Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: India #p#DHAKA, Bangladesh - The guy walking across the parking lot is famous. That's easy to tell from the reactions. Crowds part for him. Security guards mirror his every step. Other cricketers who made this same trip to the locker room tiptoed around the puddles. He strides over them, head up, confident. I am following an Indian cricket superstar, but I don't know who he is. That's the kind of trip this is going to be - one of constant confusion and mystery. #p#He's not a big man, but he's got a big aura. Fans climb the stadium wall, cheek to cheek, pressed against openings to catch a glimpse. The player looks up at the apartment buildings crowding the other side of the street, like a zoo animal in reverse, all the residents leaning over to get a peek. He waves his bat at the kids on the wall. The kids scream with joy. I grab a photographer and point. #p#Who is that? #p#He looks at me like I've got three heads. #p#Sachin Tendulkar. #p#Oh. #p#CHAPTER ONE: Dhaka. Sachin is both the riddle and the answer. That's what I'm told. You must understand India to understand Sachin, but you must understand Sachin to understand India. They created each other. They are the same. #p#This, obviously, makes no sense to me. #p#How could it? Just a few hours ago, on a mid-February morning, I landed in Dhaka. I came with a copy of Cricket for Dummies. The 2011 Cricket World Cup starts tomorrow, India at Bangladesh, and I know nothing about the sport, not even about the tremendous pressure on the Indian National Cricket team to win its second World Cup after a three-decade drought. How tremendous? The Hindustan Times' logo for their cup coverage says, every day, in enormous letters: A Billion Dreams  28 years of yearning. #p#I don't understand that the sport itself is at a crossroads, in crisis even. #p#I don't realise that Sachin Tendulkar is likely playing in his final World Cup, still searching for his first title. Tendulkar is probably the most famous man in India. He's so famous that people who worked for him are famous: a Bollywood movie character is based on his first agent, Mark Mascarenhas, who died in a car wreck. Billboards with Sachin's photo blanket India's cities; every other commercial on television features his face. He's wildly rich. He is the greatest cricketer in the world. One of the greatest ever. #p#I know none of that. #p#At the moment, I'm too busy trying to figure out the definition of a wicket. #p#Is it the manicured area in the center of the field? #p#Is it the stumps on either end of that manicured area? #p#Is it when a player gets out? #p#(Turns out, according to my book, it's all three.) #p#Cricket, like India, had long intrigued me from afar. It seemed so mysterious: a game with strange rules, and stranger vocabulary, one that can last for days, captivating billions but meriting only an inch or two in the papers at home. Only madness made it to my radar. Fan hangs himself after India loss.   Pakistan's coach allegedly murdered after upset defeat. There seemed something pure and savage that was missing from the glossy sports I follow at home. #p#My first day in Bangladesh, I'm sitting in the press box considering the journey ahead. Sambit Bal, the editor of ESPNcricinfo, sits next to me. If you are looking for someone with the opposite of my cricket knowledge, he's it. Back home, an Alabama fan had killed the trees at Toomer's Corner, and I was trying to explain the significance to him. This was big news to me. I'm a Southern boy, and I tend to believe that SEC football is the most important thing in the world. Only, Sambit has never heard of Auburn, or Alabama, doesn't know that they play college football, or that they are rivals. I fumble around. This is perhaps America's most intense rivalry. A fan just poisoned two 130-year-old oak trees. It's serious. I need an analogy. #p#My first thought: It's like India-Pakistan in cricket. #p#Except, you know, for the four wars since 1947 and the constant threat of nuclear holocaust. Other than that, Auburn-Alabama is just like India-Pakistan. #p#This is my first day in the world of cricket. #p#I have a lot to learn. #p#No magic moment today Game day outside the stadium is wild. People fill the streets for blocks. A drum beats somewhere in the distance. Vuvuzelas are the horn section. The roar of the mob gets louder and louder until it's just white noise. Chaos is the new normal. Loud is the new quiet. Dhaka has ceased to function. #p#The stadium fills up. India is the favourite to win the tournament. The team's line-up is stocked with sluggers. The first two swagger to the center of the field: Virender Sehwag and Sachin Tendulkar. They are really here, waddling in pads, giving fist bumps. The crowd is bubbling now after months of anticipation, after years of hunger for their country to be seen as more than its disasters. #p#The first ball brings a crescendo. #p#I'm trying to follow the game. I know Tendulkar is a star, so I focus on him. I cannot tell what makes him special. Then, before I know it, he's out, finished for the day. I don't really understand why. The fans rise to their feet as he walks off. He's scored 28 runs. It all happened so fast. I feel cheated. #p#Sehwag stays in. He crushes ball after ball. It's like watching Mark McGwire take batting practice. The dude has Popeye arms, and he's pounding the thing all over the yard. Sehwag is called the "Butcher of Najafgarh" He puts on a show. The cricket-mad Bangladeshi crowd oohs and ahs, just happy to be seeing the game in person. #p#Once, when an American company executive contacted his agent and wanted to understand what place Sachin held in Indian culture, the agent didn't quote the number of Test wins, or international centuries. He said, simply, that Sachin endorsed Audemars Piguet watches, and that the company made a model just for him. The executive was sold #p#Sehwag finally gets out with 175, an incredible total. After that, the game slows. India wins, and it's a little boring, frankly. Maybe it's because I don't know the rules, or because the scene in the street was exponentially more dramatic than the one in the stands, but the game itself seems anticlimactic. I've flown halfway around the planet, and I'm after more than an intellectual understanding of why cricket matters. There's a mystic place beyond the assignment. When the books are closed and the conversations about culture and history are over, I want to sit in a stadium and have the game explain itself to me. #p#That didn't happen tonight. #p#Innocence lost? One thing did happen - a press-box conversation during the game that will eat at me for the next week. I'm sitting with Sambit, and a guy comes up to chat. He's a former Indian cricket player turned broadcaster, Sanjay Manjrekar, and he's been captivated by Bangladesh's reaction to this World Cup opening in its capital. This pure love for cricket transports him to his past. #p#"There is a certain amount of innocence here," he tells us, "which I think India has lost." #p#The entire exchange lasts a minute or two. His lament, and the place from which it comes, are beyond me. #p#I don't yet know enough to recognise a eulogy when I hear one. #p#CHAPTER TWO: Ahmedabad, India I'm taking a retired physics professor named Kumar Bhatt and his brother Bankim to the next game. Kumar taught at Ole Miss, Kentucky and Texas. Most of that time was spent in Oxford, Miss., where I live. Before he moved back to India, his house was a few blocks from mine. If anybody would understand where I am coming from, it's a former neighbour. #p#We find our seats, and the game begins: a slow affair, plodding, with the powerful Australians still finding their legs and the overmatched Zimbabweans playing defensively, taking no chances. #p#The stadium is mostly empty. It will remain that way. I think of Manjrekar's press-box lament. #p#Kumar tells me about the history of the game. When he was growing up, championship cricket meant a Test match. White uniforms. Breaks for high tea. Unlimited overs. (An over is a set of six balls, sort of like an at-bat.) Games lasted for days. Sometimes nobody won. Cricket was designed to be played, not watched. "After five days," Kumar says, "it was frustrating for the spectators." #p#Modern attention spans began shrinking cricket. First came the World Cup format, which could be completed in a day, and is now 50 overs. More recently, the 20-over game has become popular with paying customers, an event stripped of nuance, played in the same amount of time as a baseball game. #p#We sit in the lower bleachers, the entire circle of green in front of us. An Australian player muscles a ball toward the boundary. A ball that hits or bounces over the boundary at the edge of the field is four runs; a ball that crosses it on the fly is six. Some Aussie hits are seen as gauche. Kumar clucks disapprovingly. I ask why. Old-school cricket fans don't like it when players cross the bat, which for baseball fans would be like if a right-handed hitter got an outside fastball and, instead of going the opposite way, turned and pulled it. It's vulgar. The ball should be hit in the direction from which it's pitched. #p#"You are to play gracefully," Kumar says, "and give respect to the ball." #p#Have you ever heard that something "isn't cricket"? That's where the phrase comes from. To cross the bat isn't cricket. Sehwag crosses the bat. Constantly. He wants bombs. Fours and sixes. Sehwag revels in his vulgarity. Tendulkar, although a big hitter, plays with an old school respect. Kumar loves Sachin. #p#"Grace has a place," Kumar says. #p#"The players have gotten soft," Bankim grumbles. #p#"Australia relies mostly on fast bowlers to win," Kumar says. "We don't consider it fair." #p#The sparse crowd gets behind Zimbabwe, which steals a couple of wickets. Fans whistle at the departing Australians, waving goodbye. Australia completes 50 overs with 262 runs. #p#"Not a good score," Bankim says. #p#Zimbabwe comes to bat. It's already been a long day. Kumar is 78 years old. "Would you like to leave?" he asks. #p#Bankim ignores him for a bit but gets the message. We pack our stuff. I check the scoreboard and work out some numbers. Zimbabwe is scoring 5.25 runs an over. It needs 5.26. It has a chance at the upset. I head up to the press box. I need to keep watching cricket, in person and on television, if I want a revelation. There will be a moment when it all becomes clear. #p#Maybe that will happen tonight. #p#That is one of many miscalculations I will be guilty of today. The Zimbabwe team slows down, needing 26 overs to reach 100 runs, but in the well-lit press box I hold out hope, doing the math on my phone, figuring out the run rate. At least I'm taking steps, learning the nuances of the game. I divide the runs by the overs. Repeat. Then the wire-service reporters stop watching the game and begin typing. Hope is gone. There are many ways to know when a game is over, but the most reliable is to find the correspondent from the Associated Press. The AP guy is sitting next to me. He taps furiously. #p#There will be no magic. #p#CHAPTER THREE: New Delhi. My New Delhi cab driver's name is Deepchand Yadav. He loves cricket. Once, the captain of India's 1983 World Cup champion team, Kapil Dev, rode in his car. Can you imagine?! Kapil Dev, in my cab! He hopes India will win this year's tournament. Everyone is very nervous. A billion dreams. Twenty-eight years of yearning. The team must win, for the billion, for its star. #p#"I'm fans with Sachin," he says. "Sachin is mentally cool." #p#Kids play wherever they can find a space. AFP Enlarge #p#Deepchand moved to Delhi from his village 18 years ago. Yadav is a caste name. His caste members are traditionally cow herders, and as India has changed, they've spread through the nation, taking any job they can get, sending money back to the villages. He is part of post-caste India. Anything is possible through hard work. He grinds, trying to hang on to the first rung of a lower-middle-class life. He's a smart guy, with a big smile and a luxurious mustache. #p#Six years ago, worried about the lives of his wife and three children, he brought them to Delhi with him. "My family actually likes village," he says, "but I like Delhi because business purposes is good." Six years ago, he played cricket - captain of his village team. But since his family came to the city, there's no time. He's never played cricket with his son. #p#His son is 10 years old. The boy plays cricket with friends in the street, wherever they can find a little space, five or six sharing a bat. The wheels turn. I ask Deepchand if I could play with them tomorrow. I've watched cricket, but I've never held a bat or struck a ball. Books take you only so far. The best way to know a sport is to play it with children. #p#"What's your son's name?" I ask. #p#"Sachin," he says. #p#"If Cricket Is a Religion, Sachin Is God" Deepchand chose this name carefully. A name is very important in Hindu culture. The right one, it is believed, can lead a child to immortality. A name is a compass. It points a person in a specific direction. #p#Of his three children, Deepchand got to name two of them. The girl he called Sonia, after Sonia Gandhi, a politician, "an honest and powerful woman." He wants his girl to be like her. He wants his son to be like Sachin: strong, sincere, poised. Sachin represents so many things for Indians who aspire to a better future while not losing their past in the exchange. The name literally means "pure" #p#"He never behaves badly," says Rahul Bhattacharya, once a popular young writer on cricket, now a novelist, "which Indians find very appealing. He's not had scandals with women or drugs. He's the idol for our children." #p#Before Sachin, typical Indian cricketers took few risks. For the first hour, shots were deflected, frustrating the bowler, tiring him out, forcing him into mistakes, a perfect sporting ethos in a country known for vein-popping passive-aggressiveness. Sachin changed that. His style was new. He swung a thick bat, heavier than Indians had used before. #p#He wasn't passive-aggressive. #p#He was simply aggressive. #p#He played with respect, but he also played with power. A recent book, If Cricket Is a Religion, Sachin Is God, finds an important corollary to India's history in this. Before, because of a stagnant economy, nutrition was a problem. India couldn't outslug rivals. It needed spin bowlers and crafty batsmen. An inferiority complex developed. Despite his greatness, somewhere deep inside, Indian legend Sunil Gavaskar, who retired two years before Sachin debuted, seemed terribly insecure. After he became famous, he turned down a membership to London's exclusive Marylebone Cricket Club - the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of cricket - because, once, a guard there didn't recognise him. The slights burned until they became a part of him, his pilot light, defining both him and the nation he represented. #p#Sachin isn't from that India. #p#His international debut came a year before India opened up its economy. His rise mirrored India's early-90s rise, when foreign corporations arrived in India for the first time, accounts swelling with advertising dollars, looking around for a face. They found Sachin. #p#He was India's first modern sports star, a combination of Babe Ruth, Muhammad Ali and Michael Jordan, because his rise mirrored a nation's economic rise, and he forever changed sports celebrity and marketing in India. Once, when an American company executive contacted his agent and wanted to understand what place Sachin held in Indian culture, the agent didn't quote the number of Test wins, or international centuries. He said, simply, that Sachin endorsed Audemars Piguet watches, and that the company made a model just for him. The executive was sold. #p#Sachin has been a star since he was a boy. Cops had to stand guard outside his 12th-grade exams. Despite the attention, he's remained dignified. There are no porn stars. He grants few audiences. He is the man Indians count on when things are at their worst. #p#Two weeks after the Mumbai terrorist attacks, India's 9/11, with the country reeling, India played a Test match against England. Sachin anchored the match, his performance rising to meet the stakes of the day, scoring more than 100 runs without getting out, which would be like dropping 50 in the NBA Finals. A century, it's called. His success, which he dedicated to those suffering in his hometown, added to his legend. Over coffee one evening, his current agent asked me, essentially, if Derek Jeter had a Secret Service detail. He was completely serious. I laughed out loud. No, I told him. He seemed surprised. Everywhere Sachin goes, the government of India protects him. #p#He's a national treasure. #p#Now his career is nearing its end, and fans are left with beautiful memories, to be sure, but also questions. #p#What does Sachin's retirement mean for cricket? #p#What does it mean for India? #p#Out on the edges of Delhi, huge apartment buildings stretch to the horizon. Ugly concrete boxes, row after row of them. If Bruce Springsteen were from India, he'd sing about these streets. There are things being built here. There are things being torn down #p#Elephant in the slow lane The highway runs past ancient ruins, and the lights of the cricket ground. Tomorrow, I'll see South Africa-West Indies. Today, I'm going to play cricket with little Sachin and his friends. I've brought a surprise for him. It's a Sachin Tendulkar signature series cricket bat made from pure English willow. It'll be his first proper bat, and when Deepchand told him about it last night, Sachin had trouble going to sleep. We ride out toward the suburban slums. I'm twisting around to see the wrecked castle when Deepchand shouts, "You see elephant?" #p#What? I turn around. There's an elephant in the slow lane. Cars whip past and the elephant just lumbers, oblivious, carrying people patiently to their destination. There's a freaking elephant in the slow lane. #p#"What happens if a car hits the elephant?" I ask. #p#"The car is damaged," Deepchand says. "The elephant is OK." #p#Like America in the '50s. There are elephants on the highway. There are elephant-sized metaphors shuffling alongside. This is a nation with a foot in both the past and present. India is at an end and a beginning. Over drinks in Delhi with my friends Candace and Lydia, we talk about this. Lydia is a correspondent for the New York Times and one of the world's experts on developing nations. Talking journalism with her is like talking cricket with Sachin. She cautions me to avoid trying to figure out what India is, or what it isn't, or to draw conclusions. "It leads you down all of these blind alleys," she tells me. "It defies all efforts to simplify." #p#She's right. I'm not sure what any of this means, or how cricket or Sachin fits into it, or even if he'll actually retire, but this is a critical time for the nation, just as it's a critical time for cricket. Their ambitions and threats are the same. Anyone who's here for even a few days can tell that. India today seems a lot like America in the mid-50s. #p#This is largely a pre-ironic society. Yes, there is a rich history of satire, and modern exceptions - the '50s also produced Jack Kerouac - but the earnestness with which people love Sachin is reflected in many aspects of the culture. There's no place, yet, for an Indian Daily Show. Elephants aren't for statues representing a bygone era, like the blue mustang outside Denver's airport. They are for the slow lane. #p#Movies are expected to end a certain way. Heroes in those movies are expected to behave a certain way. In his definitive book on Mumbai, Maximum City, author Suketu Mehta describes an Indian audience's reaction when the hero of a film turned out to be a terrorist. They ransacked the theatre. It does not seem strange to an Indian filmgoer that the songs in the movies have nothing to do with the plot. Mehta writes: #p#"The suspension of disbelief in India is prompt and generous, beginning before the audience enters the theatre itself. Disbelief is easy to suspend in a land where belief is so rampant and vigorous. And not just in India; audiences in the Middle East, Russia and Central Asia are also pre-cynical. They still believe in motherhood, patriotism, and true love; Hollywood and the West have moved on." #p#Commercialism is a new mistress in sports. The Indian Premier League, which plays 20-over cricket, started three years ago. The creation of the IPL is India's Dodgers-leave-Brooklyn moment. Money is changing the sport. The change is seen by most as good. Any achievement by an Indian is good, something to be admired in the light. For many Indians, especially those who speak English and are trying to navigate the brave new world of economic revolution, the issue of identity is an important one. Excellence is tied up in that search. Indian writers are judged by the size of the advance, not the magic of their words. Indian artists are judged by the price fetched at auction, not the feelings they create in someone who stands before their canvas. Open the paper any random day to find an example. When famous Bollywood actress Aishwarya Rai met Dustin Hoffman at a Lakers game, the tabloids report, she talked to him about "new market-tapping agendas and global trends" Not acting. Not his construction of Benjamin Braddock or Ted Kramer. They didn't talk craft. They talked money. #p#Over drinks, Lydia tells me one I hadn't seen. Indians are obsessed with the Guinness Book of World Records. Obsessed. #p#India still believes in the simple beauty of success. #p#Irony and cynicism come next. #p#"Irony requires a certain amount of self-confidence," Lydia says. "You have to have built enough of an identity to turn around and reject it, or to laugh at it. I think that's something that takes time." #p#The kids are all right The kids see Deepchand and me walking down the street and furiously make preparations. One of them yells, "Wickets!" and they spring to action, setting up a stack of bricks. Our field is the only greenish space in the neighborhood, dirt, really, strewn with bits of trash. The kids introduce themselves. There's Sachin. He's quiet, with a wide smile and a laugh that comes out a chortle, rushed, almost as if it's surprised him. Another one, the most confident, tells me his name is Sunny. That's Sunil Gavaskar's nickname. He's 13. The brashest kid, the cockiest, is named Deepak. #p#I pull out the bat. #p#A neighborhood kid winds up and bowls to me. The first few, I deflect. Then I get into one, a full baseball-style turn, and wallop it over the crumbling brick fence at the end of the field. Six! #p#"Good knock!" one of the kids tells me. #p#When I pop out, Sachin bats next. He crushes a high-arcing drive that lands in the trash-strewn woods. The kids hunt in the mud for the ball. The day fills with laughter. The old women sitting in the shade of a tree watch the game. Deepchand and Sachin are playing cricket for the first time together in Delhi. They are happy, tossing the ball, dad bowling and son batting. The cab driver seems suddenly lighter. #p#"We're going to win and we're going to shout in your face after we win" AFP Enlarge #p#"You're a kid again!" I yell at him across the field. #p#He throws back his head and laughs. #p#The boys fight over who'll bat next. They race back to the wicket. Sachin wins. They want me to bowl. The first time, instead of windmilling with my arm locked, I throw it like a baseball. That's a no-no. It's called chucking. I'm a chucker. Sunny explains. #p#"Full-arm action," he says. "Can I show you?" #p#He places my fingers along the seams. I wind up and clean bowl Deepchand. I've gotten him out. The kids give me high-fives. "Pretty good," Sunny says. #p#The game is no longer tedious. It's alive, inside me, in these children, even in the women grinning at us from beneath the tree. I look down at the end of the field and catch Sachin staring at his new Sachin signature bat, showing it off to his friends. #p#The kids decide we should play a game - five overs, two teams of four. Sachin and I go first. One player stands at each edge of the makeshift wicket. To score a run, each runner has to make it safely to the other end. The farther the hit, the more times we can complete the circuit. #p#I put my notebook down. The sky is blue. The sun pans across my face, warming the afternoon. The boys are happy. Deepchand is happy. I am happy, too, playing with the neighborhood kids, although when I am bowled, when I'm out, I feel like I've let a ten-year-old down. Cricket, like most team sports, is a personal game but also one of intense connection. It is both individual and communal. I'm left to watch. Sachin crushes it, six after six. Sunny kills it, too, spraying the ball around the makeshift field, over the fence. We finish with 49 runs. That's the target. #p#The next team scores fast, too. Deepak is a beast. He's barrel-chested. He hits a booming six, and when the ball is finally found, he hits another. He hits a third one, high into the air, which will come down in the trees and in the trash, a ball that will never be found, ending our match in a draw. He watches it sail into the Delhi sky, and he poses. #p#"I am Sehwag!" he says. #p#Where pure aggression comes from I am Sehwag. #p#As Sachin grew up watching Sunil, Sehwag grew up watching Sachin. He saw Sachin's aggressive stance. He took what he saw, internalised it and spat out something new, something dangerous, even. There's a reason some old-school fans find him vulgar, and Deepak screams his name. #p#Where does something like that come from? #p#We leave Deepchand's house and drive toward the airport, past the endless storefronts featuring posters of bodybuilders. Strength is in. Out on the edges of Delhi, huge apartment buildings stretch to the horizon. Ugly concrete boxes, row after row of them. If Bruce Springsteen were from India, he'd sing about these streets. There are things being built here. There are things being torn down. A shepherd drives a flock of sheep down the road, turning them into a weedy lot, the proposed site of a cultural centre. He wears a red turban, carries a staff. #p#Sehwag grew up in these badlands. He saw Sachin through the prism of the gritty world around him, looking past the grace to the power. Before Sehwag, Indian opening batsmen were supposed to take the shine off the ball. That's the cricket phrase. Take the shine off. Break it in. Wear down the bowler. Sehwag would take the shine off by going for fours and sixes. He got a reputation for dogging it on singles. And if Sachin gave birth to Sehwag, then a whole group of younger sluggers have taken it a step further. At least Sehwag still plays Test cricket. Some newer stars don't. #p#The Indian team is a blunt object, 15 men created not in the image of Tendulkar, exactly, but in the image of the new India that he both inspired and represented. Sachin carried the team alone in the '90s, but in the past decade a generation of hyper-aggressive Indian stars came of age. Former captain Sourav Ganguly ripped off his shirt and twirled it above his head on the balcony of the uptight Lord's Cricket Ground in London. #p#They are celebrities now. They frighten opposing bowlers. They themselves are not afraid. Two years ago, the team changed its jerseys from powder blue to a deeper colour. It seemed less meek. #p#I am Sehwag. #p#"The aggression, the brashness," says Bhattacharya, the cricket writer turned novelist. "It's now something which Indians see that this is what we have to do to assert our place in the world. We've been f---ed over for thousands of years. Everyone has conquered us. Now we're finding our voice. We're the fastest-growing economy in the world. We are going to buy your companies. Our cricket team is like going to f---ing abuse you back, and we're going to win and we're going to shout in your face after we win. People love that." #p#We turn on Najafgarh Road. Shop workers give us directions. Everyone knows The Butcher. In the midst of this urban blight, there is a single planted field. This all used to be farmland. Now there are big piles of sand, the dust of something old waiting to become something new. White smoke rises from burning trash. Mechanics fixing motorcycles on the sidewalk tell us to take a right at the feeble old tree past the shrine to the monkey god. #p#This is Sehwag's street. #p#When his father died, the neighbors tell us, he moved his mother to a nice place in central Delhi. Other family members live in the house now. There, they point. That's his aunt. The home is down an alley, where Sehwag used to pound cricket balls. "He was always a long hitter," a man says. #p#When India's not playing, the stadiums are pretty dead. That game has explained itself, all right: Indians aren't as cricket-mad as I thought. There is a surprising lack of street-level buzz. Sure, the televisions are going mad, and the newspapers and radio programmes and billboards. The hype machine is kicking at max RPMs. But it seems just that. Hype #p#The house has a big black gate and a bamboo fence to offer privacy for the patio. There's an orange lantern and a rooftop terrace. It's the middle-class home that Deepchand dreams of for his family. This is the home of a grain merchant who moved to the city from a village, wanting to build a new life. #p#Sachin is the son of a poet. #p#Sehwag is the son of man who sold wheat and rice. #p#The last of a dying breed? "In the golden age of cricket," Bhattacharya says, "you'd never be without rotis." #p#Halfway around the world, I feel at home here, a group of sports writers at dinner. We're crowded around an upstairs table somewhere deep inside the alleyed maze of Old Delhi. It could be Augusta, Georgia. They've brought our food but not our bread. No rotis ? Bhattacharya hits the running joke. Gallows humour. In the golden age of cricket, the dal wouldn't be bland. In the golden age of cricket, there wouldn't be so much grease in the mutton. It's never far away. Any conversation about cricket quickly arrives here: Are the changes designed to help cricket exist in a modern world actually killing the game? #p#They tell a story of Sunil Gavaskar crushing a six in a long-ago Test match and stepping back to curse himself. He knew he needed to calm down, to play for the long haul, not just one six-and-out. Adrenaline and aggression are enemies of Test success. Now some of the artistry has been bred out. The new formats have given birth to dramatic changes in strategy and in the skill set required. For football fans, imagine if a television network asked the NFL to shorten a few games a year to 15 minutes. Then imagine if, because of the success, it seemed inevitable that soon all football games would last 15 minutes. Now imagine if everyone who played football lost the ability to play the longer game. #p#"That's one of those existential cricket dilemmas," Bhattacharya says. "We don't know. We all live in fear of Test cricket perishing at the hands of Twenty20. It's something we all worry about. We don't actually know." #p#So, when Tendulkar retires, will he take an era of cricket with him? #p#"Sachin's symbolic value is very strong," Bhattacharya says. "He might be the last one." #p#Sachin is a bridge in a sport that my friends fear is burning its bridges. #p#A delicate sort of question The next afternoon we are all at the game. Bhattacharya sits next to me. His first book, a cricket travelogue called Pundits from Pakistan , has been my faithful companion on this journey. He has a big day tomorrow. People magazine just called. It needs to take his picture at 8 a.m. His novel The Sly Company of People Who Care, is hot here in India. He has a face made for a photographer, in that writerly way, delicate, almost pretty, except for the crooked nose that hints at a stormy past. He's arrogant as hell, but in the same way I am, so we get along great. #p#I'm learning the rules. I feel more at home every day. The stadium is like any American stadium: (too-)loud music and ham-fisted promotion. The fans sit quietly until a JumboTron camera finds them, then they go nuts. Look! Everyone's a celebrity! #p#But there's something missing. #p#The stands are half-empty. These are two great teams, elite sides, evenly matched, on a beautiful Delhi day, in a city of 14 million people, and most seats are empty. They'll stay that way. It's not just Delhi. When India's not playing, the stadiums are pretty dead. That game has explained itself, all right: Indians aren't as cricket-mad as I thought. There is a surprising lack of street-level buzz. Sure, the televisions are going mad, and the newspapers and radio programs and billboards. The hype machine is kicking at max RPMs. But it seems just that. Hype. A mile wide and an inch deep. The former Indian player's pressbox eulogy makes sense. India has gained an impossible amount in the past 20 years. Has it lost something, too? #p#I turn to Rahul. "Do Indians still love the actual game of cricket?" #p#There's a pause. #p#"It's a delicate sort of question," he says. #p#Another pause. #p#"The thing about Indians' love for cricket is, a lot of it is having something to support India at," he says. "A lot of it is celebrity. People in love with [team captain MS] Dhoni instead of the actual sport. It happens all the time. In the past five years, you find that matches not featuring India don't draw crowds. It does seem on some level the love is not for the sport itself but for some of the things it stands for." #p#Cricket is everywhere. It's on 24/7. It's on red carpets with Bollywood bombshells and in corporate boardrooms. But the more it is, the less it is. #p#"We've been so neutered by cricket now," Rahul says. "There's so much of it. It's reached a point where you can be oblivious to it. Indian fans now just watch India." #p#The afternoon unspools. Friends come and go. Many jokes, and a few serious conversations. Rahul is quiet. An hour or two passes. He turns to me. "The question you asked me  " #p#He's been thinking. India leads you down blind alleys. It is a place with many different regions and religions and cultures. The Indian national cricket squad binds them. You must understand that to understand the mania surrounding the team. #p#The team's rabid popularity, he says, is a reflection of rising national ambition, of pride in national achievement. The Guinness Book of World Records , squared. In a republic with a short history and a thin national narrative, cricket and Bollywood are India's baseball and apple pie. Rahul makes air quotes and says, "Indian culture." #p#A national treasure Associated Press Enlarge #p#"People think if I'm Indian," he says, "I have to access this part of our culture. It's in our blood." #p#More time passes. The game continues to drag. I think about tomorrow's flight and my trip to Bangalore. In a few days, I'll finally see India play in India. That's ground zero. I'm ready to see the obsession up close, see if I'll find passion or more hype. Next to me, Rahul is in thought, too. Something's bothering him. #p#"I wonder," he says, "if I've been too cynical about India and its passion for cricket." #p#CHAPTER FOUR: Bangalore hype. Morning dawns ghost-white. We drive into a wall of smog. Pollution is the price of progress. One of the prices, anyway. Some drivers pull over. Jets scream overhead. We cannot see them. The New Delhi airport is nearby. We cannot see it either. Soon we can't even see the car directly in front of us. Two disembodied red lights float in the chemical haze. The driver slows. He finds the turn at the last minute and screeches to the terminal. I'm dreading the usual chaos of an Indian airport. #p#But once inside, I am transported. Is this the future? The place is new and serene. The floors are shiny. A fancy coffee kiosk teems with under-caffeinated commuters. The food court has a Subway, a Baskin-Robbins, a McDonald's, a Yo!China. There's a bookstore. A bronze elephant towers in the lobby. #p#That's when I see it. #p#There's a restaurant named Dilli Streat. It's a take on Delhi's famous street-food scene. It has slightly dressed-up versions of blue-collar classics. The concept is an ironic mixture of old and new, with a winking nod to a past seen as quaint yet valuable. Cynicism and irony, on back-to-back days. #p#India is changing at lightning speed. #p#The new camera-smashing Indian heroes Players walk through the lobby of the Royal Gardenia hotel. Wide-eyed young fans and gossip-hunting reporters slowly circle, the light and dark of fame. I'm sitting on a couch. A woman approaches. She's from a local tabloid. She wants me to take a paparazzi picture of an English cricket player, a wealthy Indian liquor tycoon and the tycoon's son. They're together in the bar. She wants me to be her Trojan horse. #p#"We have a lot of pressure from our editor-in-chief to get the story," she says. "You know that pressure? OK. So I need a picture. I'm local. They've seen me. They know my face. And, um, so we would like to take their pictures to publish. To print. So  we wondered if you could help us." #p#"I can't do it." #p#"I just want you to take a picture. That's it." #p#"No." #p#"No? It's just a picture." #p#"Then you go take it." #p#I tell her that I'm a reporter, too, a professional, not a tourist, and I cannot be talked into anything, much less this. #p#"I could go take the picture myself," she says. "I just don't want my camera smashed. That's the issue." #p#"They won't smash your camera," I say. #p#"Of course they will," she says. "He's done it before. The kid." #p#Her editors don't want cricket info. They want to know about the players' lives. This is a fairly recent development. Everything is changing. Lines must be crossed, ethics blurred. The newspaper industry is still rising here. Competitive celebrity gossip is corrosive, and it leads, almost inevitably, to the taking down of heroes - the end of heroes, even, for deep earnestness cannot survive a daily diet of snark. I think of Jane Leavy's magnificent book about Mickey Mantle, and her documenting the moment when Americans began viewing our idols differently. India, it seems, is approaching that day. Another question about Tendulkar arises: Is he the final star athlete created by that deeply earnest society, the one with its suspension of disbelief fully intact? #p#Is he the last hero? #p#Cricket is Bollywood by a different name. The match-fixing scandal of the late-90s was the end of an innocence about the game, and Sachin's role in steadying the ship afterward is part of people's great love for him. But the lid is off. The readers demand information. The pressure is great. Where do they eat dinner? Whom are they dating? What movies do they like? What's their favourite food? What's to come? Are they on drugs? Are they taking steroids? What are their failures and weaknesses and scandals? #p#"Are they the same as us?" the tabloid reporter asks. #p#They will be soon. #p#Kids in the lobby The thirst of a tabloid reporter and the love of a starstruck child are fruit from the same tree. Maybe the difference is intent, and maybe it's innocence, which sounds like the pitter-patter of tiny feet on marble floors. Kids chase their favorite cricketers around the hotel. Their joy restores faith, washes away cynicism. Maybe the soul of cricket can survive this landslide of change. Maybe there's more than hype. #p#To the cute little stalkers, there are many heroes besides Sachin. Parents hover nearby, briefly children again. Virat Kohli is eating in the coffee shop against the back wall covered with ivy. He's got a woman with him. Kids hang by the door. Ten minutes is an eternity to a child who's a few feet from his hero. #p#Vineet Sethi sits with his daughters, 15-year-old Radhika and nine-year-old Nandini. The girls started plotting the moment this game was announced for Bangalore. High-level strategy. When Vineet got home from work, the girls were ready to go. It's D-Day. Who will they meet? #p#Finally, mercifully, Kohli stands to leave. The girls rise to meet him at the door. Kohli has a faux-hawk and a tight black T-shirt. He signs. His date carries a designer handbag. Radhika is checking out the signature when Nandini's eyes widen. OMG! #p#It's Sehwag. #p#Up close, he's stocky and balding. He stops to sign. Then Gautam Gambhir comes down the hall. The girls are losing their minds now. Dad asks if he'll pose for a photo. Gautam smiles for the camera. #p#"I'm gonna faint," Radhika says. #p#The newspaper industry is still rising here. Competitive celebrity gossip is corrosive, and it leads, almost inevitably, to the taking down of heroes - the end of heroes, even, for deep earnestness cannot survive a daily diet of snark #p#The girls can't stop looking at the autograph book, then leaning into each other, then giggling, then looking, then giggling. "I cannot believe you told Virat Kohli that I'm in love with him!" Radhika says. #p#Vineet laughs. #p#"I only like Gautam," Radhika says. "I don't like Virat Kohli anymore. I used to like him a lot, but he was with a girl. A nice one." #p#Dad is still laughing but has that worried-dad look on his face. #p#"Why not Sehwag?" I ask. #p#"He's married," Radhika says. "And has two kids." #p#Vineet looks a bit pale. "I'm not listening," he says. #p#The girls cover their faces with their hands, tapping their feet, tingling with nervous energy. I feel it. The passion I looked for at the other cricket matches doesn't exist around the sport, but it does in the Royal Gardenia lobby. Indians might not be obsessed with the sport of cricket per se, but they are with the Indian cricket team. They are unhealthy, myopic and without measure or self-control, and that's just when they see their idols in the flesh. #p#I cannot imagine what it's like when they're actually watching them play. #p#CHAPTER FIVE: Game day. The morning of the India-England match, I wake up anxious. No newspaper, no television. No more hype. The more someone tells me something matters, the more suspicious I become. The game stands on its own today. It could bring my moment of rapture - or deep disappointment. What if the thing I'm hungry for is too rare to just happen upon? What if it no longer exists? #p#The driver picks me up outside the hotel. The traffic is terrible as we make our way toward the stadium. I can see the light stanchions in the distance. I wonder what they'll shine on today. Somehow, on a lark to be introduced to a new sport, I've stumbled into a rapidly changing world. Things are being gained, and things are being lost. What if I've come to cricket too late? Other cricket reporters sense this fear; one asks me if I'll be writing a positive or negative story. I'm not sure. It seems that the sporting future in India is the present in America. I can see their tomorrow. #p#The driver drops me at the main gate. I walk around for several hours. The air smells like fried food. Vendors sell Indian snacks and sugarcane juice. Cops, wary of another cricket riot, whack sticks against trees whenever someone stops. There is no still today. #p#"Sachin!" a man yells. "Sachin's last World Cup!" #p#"He will not retire after the World Cup," another insists. #p#A group of fans are being interviewed by a television reporter. They're young and funny. They're intentionally extreme, with knowing smirks. #p#"After 300 years of them ruling us," one says, "it's time we gave it back." #p#"We're gonna trash the English," another says. #p#"They play like little boys," says the third. #p#They seem so confident, not people who need any outside validation. Maybe Sachin isn't needed any longer. Maybe Sehwag is more representative. That hasn't occurred to me until now. Later I'll talk to an Indian journalist, Vaibhav Vats, who is writing about cricket as a window into national self-esteem. He thinks Sachin isn't as important as he used to be. #p#"It's about wealth," Vats says. "So you don't look for external things to shore up your own sense of identity. There isn't the identity crisis there was then." #p#Fans wave Indian flags. For 10 rupees, about 22 cents, dozens of entrepreneurs paint Indian flags on people's faces. Other kids take blue paint and, emulating a famous billboard around the country, tag themselves "Bleed Blue" Sports marketing creating fan behaviour creating more sports marketing: a snake eating its tail. #p#A man chases me down. He's wearing a long robe with the Indian flag painted on it, along with the cricket alpha and omega: "Sachin" and "Sehwag." There's a young boy with him. The boy opens up a binder. It's full of stories about the man wearing the robe. They point to one. He's offered to trade his kidney for a ticket to this game. He says he wants to watch cricket. I think he wants to be a star. #p#Finally, I slip through a gate. #p#It's almost time. #p#Finally, the game is at hand We hear the cheers as the Indian bus gets closer. The soldier on the tower with the rifle stands up from his red chair. Radios squawk. The bus pulls to a stop. Submachine-gun-toting troops in tight t-shirts and khaki fatigues form a wall of flesh and metal. #p#Sachin Tendulkar is third off the bus. I recognise him now. He's wearing headphones, yesterday's smile replaced by determination. We enter the stadium behind the team. The place simmers with anticipation. I trade my press-box seat for one in the bleachers. Today, I'm a fan. Andy Zaltzman, a cricket-mad British stand-up comedian, sits next to me. The speakers play music so loud we cannot talk when it's on. "Don't need it," Andy says every time there's some marketing flourish. The broadcast people interview some fans. "Dhoni's hot," a young woman says. #p#The broadcast people interview Dhoni. "How are you coping with the hype and the pressure?" the man asks. #p#"We're looking forward to the national anthem," Dhoni says. #p#The music begins, and the crowd comes to its feet. Here we go. Andy saw a game in this stadium on television once, India versus Pakistan, and the cacophony when an Indian player bowled his opponent seemed to come out of his television and transport his London home across two oceans and several lesser seas. That noise is something he cannot forget. He's chasing that ghost, left a wife and two kids at home for six weeks to chase it halfway around the world. I'm chasing something, too. The appointed hour has arrived. I've heard it all week, from fans and writers, and now I hear it once more. #p#After all the drama, a tie Getty Images Enlarge #p#"Wait 'til Sachin comes to bat," Andy says. #p#In case you were wondering: here, now, the rules This time, I'm ready for whatever is about to happen. #p#After 10 days I know the basic calculus of cricket. Each team has 50 overs and 10 wickets. For baseball fans, think of it as 50 at-bats and 10 outs. All overs last six balls, whether any of them are hit or not. A player is out if just one of his hits is caught, or if he misses the ball and it strikes the wicket behind him, or if a fielder throws the ball into the wicket before he completes a run. #p#When either the overs or wickets are gone, the innings is over; an innings is a set of 50 overs, and each team, in one-day cricket, has one. Wickets and overs are the two resources a team has when setting a target, or, if it bats second, chasing it. Figuring out when and how to risk them is the chess match. A wicket can be gone with one moment of carelessness. #p#Sachin's agent once brought a business partner to a game only to have Sachin get out on the first ball. The ball doesn't care that there are executives in a luxury suite. There are 11 opponents constantly shifting around the green field, looking to trick, to trap, to slide into a spot where a ball is coming. #p#The cricket pitch is a dangerous ocean. The batsman is a tiny boat. #p#Constructing magic Sachin's name is lost in the cheers. The crowd roars even in anticipation of it. Once again Sachin walks onto the field. Sehwag is with him. They are leading off, alternating at-bats, an entire modern history of a country between them. Sunil begat Sachin begat Sehwag. From insecurity to confidence to aggression. Which will be best today? #p#Sachin looks up at the crowd. He rubs his hands together. Spits on them. Sehwag takes one practice cut. It's time. Sehwag hits an immediate four, one that's almost caught. The Indian fans jump, then laugh. Sehwag pops up, and it is again almost caught. He's swinging for the fences. #p#Sachin plays slower, taking his runs where he can get them, defending the other pitches away. Shades of Gavaskar? "Sachin has this aura of calmness around him," Andy says. "Federer has it. Brady seems to have it." #p#Then, a victim of his own aggression, Sehwag is out. He slams the bat down. Gambhir, the hotel girl's idol, comes in. As he gets comfortable batting, Sachin slows down more, protecting himself. When he sees a pitch to drive, he steps into it. His first four of the day. The speakers play Bon Jovi's "It's My Life" Sachin hits another one, then gets conservative, taking no risks. He's trying to bat 35 or 40 overs, to anchor his team, to give openings to the other batsmen by consuming the attention of the bowlers. The crowd senses something special and chants, "Sachin! Sachin! Sachin!" #p#A feeling arises, a rare one, that you are part of a group watching something special. The power of sport is that, on occasion, it redeems the messes we create around it. Cricket can be stronger than the forces changing it. Victories are fleeting, but the poems are what matters. I don't know if cricket is about to be ruined, or if Sachin is no longer needed, if he's retiring or if he'll defy expectations and play 10 more years. These are things we can guess about but never know. #p#I do know this: I am a fan. I am sunburned but do not care. I lose track of time. That's not a narrative flourish. Hours seem like moments. #p#Rapture comes to the people here. I see Sachin constructing a score, and I understand the planning, and the years of experience, that lead a man to this field on this day, and to the artistry he now holds as part of himself, like a chamber of his heart. We are congregants in a church. We are watching the son of a poet. The stand-up comedian is serious. This is a perfect at-bat, Andy tells me. This is art, and I am lucky to see it. Soon, Sachin will be gone. This feeling will be gone. Right now, it is alive. It has the power of a name, immortal and pure. #p#"You don't have to know anything about it," my friend Gokul says. #p#"It's almost a religious experience," Andy says, "seeing Tendulkar play so well in front of his home crowd. It's a communal worship." #p#England sends in Graeme Swann, the best spin bowler in the world. They are targeting Sachin. One mistake and he's gone. The crowd grows tense. Swann winds up. The roar of the crowd rises, like the start of a football game. The ball arrives. The crack echoes through the stadium. #p#<m1>Sachin has hit it off the scoreboard.</m1> #p#<m2>It's an uppercut. A knockout blow. A roaring Up yours! A six.</m2> Flags wave and shake. Three fans wearing clown wigs blow their whistles over and over. #p#Swann winds up again. #p#<m3>Sachin crushes it, another uppercut, over the fence. Two pitches, two sixes.</m3> The air is sucked out of the stadium, and Bon Jovi is played again. But now, incredibly, the crowd noise is louder than the sound system. The real finally trumps the fake. Swann looks broken. #p#Sachin is building toward a century. The crowd wants it for him, for themselves. The noise doesn't ebb between bowls. <m4>He's got 72</m4>, then <m5>a four gives him 76</m5>. The clown wigs go batty. <m6>Sachin goes up high to get 78</m6>. The crowd needs this. A wave passes five full revolutions around the grandstand. Eighty-two. Eighty-six. The people behind me are barking now. The noise is constant. I am inside the soul of cricket. I get it. I will be back again, like Andy, chasing this ghost. Across town, Sachin's agent's BlackBerry buzzes. "Wonderful moment," one reads. An English friend writes, "Sachin is killing us. Awesome." One executive wants to put his company logo on Sachin's bat. The sister of Sachin's first agent, the man who died in the car wreck, writes, "Hope this one was for Mark." #p#<m7>Sachin gets to 98</m7>. #p#The sound system plays, "We Will Rock You!" The crowd pronounces the last two words as one. Rockyou! Rockyou! Rockyou! Everyone in the stadium is standing, again, and typing this 25 hours later, I get chill bumps. Again. #p#Sachin hits a four. #p#<m8>He's done it. A century.</m8> I've never been in a stadium that feels like this one. Hindus and Muslims, Sikhs and Christians, people from different castes and classes, speakers of a dozen languages, all citizens in the Republic of Sachin. The stern cops give wide smiles and thumbs-ups. The chant goes from "Sachin! Sachin!" to "Hoo  ha  IN-DI-A!" They are interchangeable. #p#<m9>Finally, at 120, Sachin pops out. He walks off, and the crowd rises once again.</m9> The people lean over the railings, trying for one more moment with their hero. #p#He waves his bat and disappears. #p#<m10>Sachin's gone</m10>. #p#Falling apart. The Indian players collapse without him. #p#They leave too many runs on the table, lost without their anchor. <m11>Their score is 338</m11>. They cannot play defence or bowl, and England steadily mounts a comeback, putting up run after run. The worrying begins. The fans sense something, a fatal flaw built into this team of sluggers. They can all hit the ball a mile, but they can't get anybody out. Power has its limits. They are wasting Sachin's brilliance. The noise dies down. The stadium is still. People look into themselves. The team is a proxy for the nation, so what does an Indian collapse tell them about India? About India without Sachin? #p#<m12>England scores, off big hits, off bad pitches, off lazy defense.</m12> The India outfielders don't run down balls that go for fours. Next to me, Andy finds hope. <m13>With 15 overs left, England need 102 runs off 90 balls.</m13> "It's bizarrely easy," Andy says. #p#An Indian writer shakes his head. "We've lost this game," he says. #p#The fans agree. People file, en masse, to the exits. The wire-service reporters type their stories. I'm spinning from the reversal in fortunes. A fourth of the seats are empty. Now a third. <m14>England needs 61 runs from 54 balls</m14>. <m15>Now 59 from 48.</m15> #p#Then <m16>India gets a wicket.</m16> #p#<m17>Then a second in a row</m17>. #p#He is a bridge, and it is vital to the psyche of a nation that he remains intact. He gets it. That's why he never loses focus. Nothing, it turns out, is effortless. In his room, he seems tired, worn out mentally and physically. He needs a break #p#The crowd comes alive. What does this revival tell them about their nation? About themselves? Andy shifts uncomfortably. The place shakes. The whistles are back out from the clown wigs. The barking returns. People howl. <m18>England needs 57 runs from 39 balls</m18>. An Indian player makes a huge diving catch. Hustle has returned. India has returned. #p#"I didn't see this coming," Andy says. #p#There is dancing in the aisles. The Indian team is getting more wickets, which eliminates the strongest English batsmen and puts pressure on the bottom of the line-up. <m19>England needs 50 from 28</m19>. <m20>Now 29 from 11</m20>. It seems finished. The local in front of me tweets: "It's amazing to watch India in India." #p#Suddenly, England counters. <m21>Two big-bang sixes</m21>, and <m22>it's 14 runs from six balls</m22>. One more over. I can barely breathe. Nobody can. The noise is deafening now, rising in crescendo before each bowl. Imagine a football kickoff every 30 seconds. #p#The Indians are going to win. <m23>England needs 12 from five</m23>, then <m24>11 from four</m24>. The "India" chant returns. #p#Then <m25>England hits a six, crushed, into the stands</m25>. #p#"Unbelievable," the Indian writer says. #p#<m26>The target is now five runs from three balls</m26>. <m27>England singles</m27>. <m28>It's four runs from two</m28>. <m29>The English get a double</m29>. <m30>We are down to the last ball. Two runs from one.</m30> That's it now. All the hype, and the planning, and all these hours, down to a moment. The infield comes in. The crowd rises. #p#The stadium quiets. #p#A man folds his hands in prayer. The clown wigs are silent. One sits down. The local reporter puts up his notebook. <m31>The Indian bowler winds up, the English batsman swings, makes contact, crack, it's happening so fast, the fielder rushes over, gets the ball in. England scores only one. India did it!</m31> #p#In the moments after the end, there's confusion. I'm confused. The crowd noise is strange. I look around. The scoreboard is hard to read. We've spent eight hours and two minutes in these seats. Has India won? Has England? What happened? I'm looking to Andy, trying to understand. That's when I realise: I did the math wrong. Two to win, which means, after all that drama, my God  #p#<m32>It's a tie.</m32> #p#Carrying the hopes of a billion countrymen. One last stop remains before the airport. "We've got 30 seconds," his agent says. #p#A special key card grants access to the 18th floor. Three plainclothes bodyguards look us over. A sign hangs on the door. "Shhh," it reads, "I'm sleeping like a baby." The agent knocks. #p#Sachin Tendulkar opens the door. "Come, come," he says. #p#A tangle of wires covers the bedside table closest to his pillow. There's a Diet Coke and a bottle of water. A Hindu shrine is on the other side. There's a book across the room, The Last Nizam, about the end of one era and the beginning of another, about a king who lost his throne in a time of great change. #p#His agent explains my journey to Sachin. "He didn't know anything about cricket before he came," he says. #p#Sachin looks at me. He seems confused. "Hmmmmm," he says. #p#His phone rings. The ringtone is U2. We chat, and he loosens. He doesn't overtalk. It's strange. There actually is an aura of calm around him. It must be how he's survived. At the centre of this mania is a reservoir of peace, focus and determination. I ask if he spends a lot of time in America. #p#"Not really," he says. "I have a lot of friends there, but it's too far for me to travel." #p#"I'm about to get on a 15-hour flight," I say. #p#He laughs and grimaces with me. A trip to the states, he says, needs several weeks to be worth the flight. "I don't have 15 to 20 days," he says. #p#He's carried the burden of a billion people for more than 20 years. Just outside the hotel is a billboard with his stern face looking down on the city. Its tagline is direct: "We've waited 28 years to hold the Cup. Hope that wait ends now." Heroes don't punch clocks. #p#Sachin Tendulkar says goodbye and closes his door, while, in every direction, a vast nation sees its hopes and dreams in him, for at least a little while longer. I step into the elevator, then a car, then three flights, then my car, then my house. I return from blind alleys and brightly lit fields, having found my moment of rapture and, at the end, the man who created it. I've found both the riddle and the answer, and I wonder what it must cost someone to be both of those things. One part of my conversation with Tendulkar will return to me every time India plays in this World Cup. #p#His agent told me he's aware of what he means to people, of the symbolic importance of being both the beginning and end of something. He is a bridge, and it is vital to the psyche of a nation that he remains intact. He gets it. That's why he never loses focus. Nothing, it turns out, is effortless. In his room, he seems tired, worn out mentally and physically. He needs a break. I ask when was the last time he had 20 days off in a row with nothing to do. No balls to hit or billions to represent. #p#"I'm waiting for that time to come," he says.
11	805853	My First World Cup	Lifting the trophy and a legend		December 21, 2014	shares #p#Piyush Chawla learnt an important bowling lesson after the India-England tie in Bangalore. AFP #p#I was desperate to be part of the 2011 World Cup, played in the subcontinent. Early in the 2007 World T20 in South Africa, I'd got injured but was allowed to stay on, and I felt the excitement of winning a global tournament. #p#Two months before the 2011 World Cup, I didn't think I would make the cut. When I was picked I felt a sort of relief, though I also knew the pressure we would feel due to the faith that millions of fans had in the team. #p#As we got closer to our opening match in Dhaka, World Cup fever was enormous. The pressure was heavier than I had imagined. Wherever we went, we were told only one thing: win the trophy. #p#Slowly it started getting on our nerves. We decided to switch off from all the talk outside and concentrate on our job. I stopped reading newspapers, as did most of my team-mates. As the tournament progressed, we got used to mechanically responding to the hotel staff and fans about the need to keep winning. #p#Other than playing at home, a big factor for the team was that this was going to be Sachin Tendulkar's last World Cup. All of us in the squad had idolised him since childhood, and if we could contribute a little to help him fulfil his dream, we would have been thrilled. That is what we managed to do. The victory in the final and the euphoria after Mahi bhai [MS Dhoni] hit that six at the Wankhede is hard to explain in words. #p#While the nation celebrated with Sachin paaji , we did a victory lap, carrying him on our shoulders. It was the most memorable night of my life - lifting the trophy and then lifting the legend on our shoulders, as the whole nation celebrated. #p#<m1>For me, the penultimate over that I bowled against England taught me more than the thousands of overs I had bowled till then.</m1> It was a very close match and when Mahi bhai gave me the ball, he told me to bowl to the plan. With every ball the pressure piled on. It was an exciting over. <m2>I got hit for two sixes</m2>, <m3>picked up a wicket off the last ball</m3>, and <m4>the match was eventually tied</m4>. #p#At the time I felt we had almost lost the match because of my over. But my team-mates were encouraging as ever. After returning to my room that night, I thought about it and realised I was thinking far too much before bowling every ball, which used to confuse me. That was the biggest lesson for me: to keep it as simple as possible in the toughest times. #p#As told to Amol Karhadkar, a correspondent at ESPNcricinfo ESPN Sports Media Ltd..
12	503322	Canada v Zimbabwe, Group A, World Cup 2011, Nagpur	Teams seek revival after poor start	The Preview by Siddhartha Talya	February 27, 2011	#p#Match Facts #p#February 28, Nagpur Start time 09.30 local time (04:00 GMT) #p#Charles Coventry hasn't clicked in quite some time AFP Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: Ashish Bagai | Charles Coventry Matches: Canada v Zimbabwe at Nagpur Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Canada | Zimbabwe #p#Big Picture #p#Given what's transpired in this World Cup so far, Group B, which includes Ireland and Netherlands, has clearly emerged as the more competitive pool. While the Associate teams in Group B have, through their performance, challenged the ICC's plans of a ten-team World Cup in 2015, their counterparts in Group A have done little to justify their inclusion. By getting bowled out for 69 and then humbled by 205 runs, Kenya, more than anybody else, have provided ammunition to the ICC's argument but Canada are not too far behind. #p#No one expected them to perform a miracle against Sri Lanka, but some resistance against one of the tournament favourites would have given them confidence for the remainder of their campaign. That resistance was absent in their 210-run thrashing in Hambantota. Though underdogs, Ashish Bagai, their captain, said Zimbabwe and Kenya were the best opportunities for Canada to achieve a favourable result in this tournament. Against an opposition weaker than the one they faced in their opening game, it's time to step up and back their participation in the World Cup with some spirit. #p#There were brighter signs for Zimbabwe in their opening game for Australia. Spin is their strength with the trio of Ray Price, Graeme Cremer and Prosper Utseya restraining the batsmen. Spinners, in fact, bowled 39 of the 50 overs but the batting failed the team. There is significant experience in the top and middle orders but the bulk of the responsibility in Zimbabwe's chase fell on those lower down the list. On what is expected to be a flat pitch, against a Canadian attack, Zimbabwe's batsmen have the right opportunity to get into the groove. #p#Form guide (Last five completed games, most recent first) #p#Zimbabwe : LLLLW Canada : LLWWW #p#Pitch and conditions #p#The performance of the top order remains the worry for both teams in the lead-up to this game, and they've got the pitch they need to recover. The track is expected to favour batsmen, Netherlands and England were involved in a high-scoring contest here while New Zealand failed to take advantage of the conditions at hand. Neither team has an excuse to capitulate the way they did in their previous game. #p#Watch out for  #p#Charles Coventry : After his sparkling, record-equalling 194 against Bangladesh, Coventry hasn't quite shone in international cricket. An attacking batsman, Coventry hasn't lived up to his potential in the recent past, his last 18 innings yielding just one half-century. He's got starts, a spate of scores between 10 and 20, but his failure to push on has undermined, somewhat, the hype around him after that landmark achievement. #p#Ashish Bagai : The Canada captain gave up a lucrative career in the banking industry to play as a full-time cricketer for his country, only to learn his team may not feature in the next edition of this tournament. In a squad comprising five Under-19 players and without much experience, he's among the few the team looks to for guidance. He's been in good form of late, with six half-centuries in 2010 amid a series of other useful contributions and forms a key component of the Canadian middle order. #p#Team news #p#The seamer Henry Osinde walked off the field due to an injury after bowling just 2.1 overs against Sri Lanka. They don't have another pace option in the reserves, so they'll be forced to play a slow bowler or an extra batting option in the event of his failure to recover. The squad also includes Nitish Kumar, the youngest player in the World Cup. Will he open the batting with the oldest player in the tournament, John Davison? #p#Canada (probable): 1 John Davison, 2 and 3 Nitish Kumar and Ruvindu Gunasekara, 4 Zubin Surkari, 5 Ashish Bagai (capt and wk), 6 Rizwan Cheema, 7 Tyson Gordon, 8 Khurram Chohan, 9 Harvir Baidwan, 10 WD Balaji Rao, 11 Henry Osinde/Parth Desai. #p#Zimbabwe captain Elton Chigumbura hinted his team would retain its three-pronged spin attack. They could go in with an unchanged team. They have seamer Shingirai Masakadza, allrounder Tinashe Panyangara and left-hand batsman Terry Duffin in the 15-man squad as well. #p#Zimbabwe (probable): 1 Brendan Taylor, 2 Charles Coventry, 3 Tatenda Taibu (wk), 4 Craig Ervine, 5 Elton Chigumbura (capt), 6 Sean Williams, 7 Regis Chakabva, 8 Prosper Utseya, 9 Graeme Cremer, 10 Ray Price, 11 Chris Mpofu. #p#Try picking the XIs for tomorrow's game by playing Team Selector. #p#Stats and trivia #p#Only three out of Canada's 15 players in this World Cup were born in Canada - John Davison, Nitish Kumar and Zubin Surkari. #p#Zimbabwe and Canada have met just once in an ODI, in Port of Spain in 2006. Canada were thrashed by 143 runs. #p#Canada made their World Cup debut before Zimbabwe did, though the latter went on to become an elite cricketing nation. Canada played in the 1979 World Cup, Zimbabwe made their World Cup debut in 1983 and stunned Australia in their first game. Canada folded for 139 in their first match, against Pakistan. #p#Quotes #p#"Against Australia we bowled well and fielded well, just that we did not finish off with the bat. So hopefully we will finish off with the bat this time. On the bowling side we need to stick to our strengths." Elton Chigumbura on what Zimbabwe need to work on #p#"It's about spending time at the crease. The first few guys need to get us through the tough overs. Once we go past the first ten overs, it should be alright." Ashish Bagai spells out what Canada need to do to fix their batting woes.
12	503375	Canada v Zimbabwe, Group A, World Cup 2011, Nagpur	Canada ponder changes, Zimbabwe bank on spin	Nagraj Gollapudi in Nagpur	February 27, 2011	#p#It might be a clash of the lightweights, but both Canada and Zimbabwe know this could be one of the few opportunities to earn victory points. Little wonder then that both captains sounded confident at the weighing scale. "It is a big game for us," Elton Chigumbura said. "We have to win this match as that puts us in the running for the next stage, the quarterfinals." Later Ashish Bagai, Canada's banker-taking-a-break captain, spoke as if the victory tomorrow was a done deal. "Zimbabwe and Kenya are going to be the best chance to win," Bagai said. "Those were our team goals coming into the tournament." #p#Zimbabwe have more experience of playing on a big stage, more experienced players and many guiding lights like Heath Streak, Grant Flower and Alastair Campbell to keep an eye on them. Facing them are Canada, mostly a motley crew of amateurs. The only known name, and professional, being John Davison - the oldest player in the tournament, whose belligerent 111 (against West Indies in 2003), the second-fastest century in a World Cup, has now gathered cobwebs. So far in this edition, including the warm-up games and the first group match against Sri Lanka, the 40-year-old opener has a highest of 3. #p#The top three have failed consistently and Bagai did not rule handing a World Cup debut to the youngest player in the tournament, 16-year-old Nitish Kumar, a precocious talent according to Bagai and Davison. At the training today, Nitish was part of the first line of batsmen and later had an extended session of throw-downs against the new ball. "A bit of a shuffle is on the cards," Bagai admitted. "The first ten overs have been tough for us losing way too many wickets and it has been hard to recover. The top order needs to take responsibility." If Davison and Kumar do open, it would probably be the first occasion in a World Cup of the oldest and the youngest player walking in together. #p#The onus would be on Bagai to stay strong. He has been Canada's best batsmen in the recent past, averaging 60 in the last 13 ODIs. Another batsman known for his firepower is Rizwan Cheema. At the outset of this tournament, Cheema had said he would like to go big at every opportunity. A duck against Bangladesh did not tame his aggression as he unleashed a flurry of bit hits using raw power against England to help Canada recover from 28 for 5. His 93 runs from 71 balls gave England a mighty scare, but Canada fell short by 16 runs. #p#Still, if Chigumbura is not worried, it is because in Ray Price, Prosper Utseya and Graeme Cremer, he has three bowlers who could temper Canadian aggression. Against Australia last week in Ahmedabad, the trio had bowled in tandem and with discipline to limit the world champions to a modest total. "We are going to play to our strengths which is on the spinners side. On the bowling side it won't change much," Chigumbura said, indicating Zimbabwe were likely to stick to the same bowling line-up. #p#Incidentally, Zimbabwe suffer from the same problem that ails their opponent: their top three have been inconsistent. Both Brendan Taylor and Tatenda Taibu have played 100-plus ODIs but neither has managed to grown into a dependable batsmen. Charles Coventry has fallen apart after he equalled Saeed Anwar's then-record 194 against Bangladesh in 2009. He has since hit only one half-century. #p#Even though the match is likely to be played to empty stands - not such an uncommon experience for both teams - it will be far from a quiet contest with both sides having a lot to prove while there is also a lot to lose.

Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: Balaji Rao | Graeme Cremer | Craig Ervine | Ray Price | Tatenda Taibu Matches: Canada v Zimbabwe at Nagpur Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Canada | Zimbabwe #p#Zimbabwe's spinners made sure <m12>a record third-wicket partnership between Tatenda Taibu and Craig Ervine</m12> didn't go to waste, maintaining an asphyxiating grip on Canada's batsmen to secure <m13>a 175-run win</m13> in Nagpur. <m14>Taibu and Ervine's stand</m14>, which is Zimbabwe's highest for the third wicket in ODIs and their fifth largest overall, helped <m15>their team recover from a decidedly shaky start to reach 298 for 8</m15> on a good batting wicket. While the ascendancy had swung between the two teams in the first innings Zimbabwe's slow bowlers assumed full control in the afternoon, sharing 37.1 overs and <m16>all ten wickets</m16> as <m17>Canada were bowled out in the 43rd over</m17>. #p#Despite needing practically a-run-a-ball from the start Canada would still have begun their batting effort with the belief that an upset was not impossible. What was needed was a positive start by <m18>their opening pair, the unlikely couple of veteran batsman John Davison and the comparatively foetal Nitish Kumar</m18> who, at 40 and 16 respectively, are the oldest and youngest players at this tournament. #p#<m19>Davison looked to attack Ray Price - who shared the new ball once again - almost immediately but ran straight past a flighted delivery that straightened just enough to clip the top of off stump</m19>. Things got worse for Canada four overs later when, in consecutive deliveries, <m20>Price stuck out his left hand and held onto a chipped drive to get rid of Kumar</m20> and <m21>Ashish Bagai swept straight to short backward square</m21>. <m22>Jimmy Hansra safely negotiated the hat-trick ball</m22> but the damage had been done with Canada staring into <m23>the precipice at 7 for 3</m23>. #p#<m24>Hansra and 19-year-old Ruvindu Gunasekara clung gamely to the crease for a while</m24>, but the required rate rose steadily as the slow bowlers strengthened their stranglehold. As the frustration rose <m25>Hansra again used his feet to Utseya but this time an arm ball rushed past the outside edge and he was easily stumped for a 41-ball 20</m25>. #p#<m26>Gunasekara followed in the very next over, bottom-edging an attempted late cut onto his own stumps</m26>, and <m27>when the big-hitting Rizwan Cheema mis-hit a full toss straight to short fine leg Canada were 66 for 6</m27> and the match was over as a contest. With the pitch exhibiting increasingly extravagant turn legspinner Graeme Cremer was unleashed on the lower order, and both Tyson Gordon and Khurram Chohan were flummoxed by his subtle variations in flight and spin. #p#<m28>Zubin Surkari briefly held Zimbabwe at bay, gritting out a brave 26 before he fell to a leg-side stumping</m28>. <m29>Cremer wrapped up the innings an over later, ripping one through Balaji Rao's defences to claim his third wicket.</m29> #p#Smart Stats. <m30>Brendan Taylor became the third batsman to be dismissed off the first ball</m30> of a World Cup game. Three of the dismissals have come against Zimbabwe. <m31>Tatenda Taibu's 98</m31> is the first instance of a Zimbabwe batsman being dismissed in the nineties in a World Cup game and the 32nd instance overall of a batsman being dismissed in the nineties in a World Cup match. <m32>Taibu's 98</m32> was his third-highest score in ODIs and his 17th fifty overall. In 14 matches since June 2010, he has scored 564 runs with five half-centuries. <m33>The 181-run partnership between Taibu and Craig Irvine</m33> is the highest partnership for Zimbabwe in World Cups, surpassing the 166-run stand between Grant Flower and Craig Wishart against Namibia in 2003. It is also the fifth-highest stand for Zimbabwe in ODIs overall. <m34>Zimbabwe's 298</m34> is their fourth-highest total in a World Cup game. They have 18 scores over 300 in ODIs. <m35>Zimbabwe's 175-run win</m35> is their largest in World Cups and their fourth largest in ODIs overall. The margin of defeat is also the second largest for Canada in World Cups. #p#Canada had been able to put up much more of a challenge with the ball, <m36>legspinner Rao picking up career-best figures of 4 for 57</m36> as Zimbabwe were kept under pressure on either side of <m37>Taibu and Ervine's partnership</m37>. There was a real buzz in the field when <m38>Brendan Taylor and Charles Coventry were removed within the first four overs </m38>- <m39>Taylor pinned in front of his stumps by a Khurram Chohan inswinger on the very first ball of the day</m39> - but as the shine faded and the sun baked all life from the wicket the batsmen settled in and a large total loomed. #p#After seeing off the new ball <m40>Taibu took two boundaries from offspinner Jimmy Hansra's first over</m40>, <m41>another brace from his second</m41>, to calm Zimbabwe's nerves. <m42>He barely dipped below a-run-a-ball thereafter, bringing up a 46-ball fifty in the 15th over</m42> and playing with increasing fluency. <m43>Ervine, who made a cautious start to his innings with 17 from his first 35 balls</m43>, eventually began to pick up the tempo too and used <m44>a variety of sweep shots</m44> against the spinners to good effect as <m45>the partnership passed 100</m45>. #p#It appeared Zimbabwe had assumed full control once more, but as the ball softened it began to grip the surface and <m46>Rao got the breakthrough with one that bounced a little more than Ervine was expecting, ricocheting off the shoulder of the bat and the pad and looping up for wicketkeeper Bagai to complete a good catch.</m46> <m47>Ervine had reached 85</m47>, his highest score in ODIs, but <m48>his dismissal</m48> sparked another collapse and <m49>when Taibu top-edged a sweep to be out for 98 Zimbabwe were 201 for 5</m49>. #p#<m50>Rao had luck on his side in nipping Greg Lamb and Sean Williams out</m50>, <m51>Lamb chopping a long-hop onto his own stumps</m51> and <m52>Williams gloving a sweep to give Bagai the chance to take a third smart catch, diving forward</m52>. <m53>Zimbabwe were precariously placed at 240 for 7 at that point</m53> and were thankful for an enterprising <m54>41-run stand between Prosper Utseya and Graeme Cremer</m54>, which gave the score took a sheen of respectability after a stuttering start and a middle-order wobble. As it turned out, their score was more than enough against a Canadian line-up that showed precious little competency in combating an unrelenting hydra of spin. #p#Match Timeline

AFP Enlarge Related Links Matches: Canada v Zimbabwe at Nagpur Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Canada | Zimbabwe #p#Colour of the day. Red. And no, it wasn't the film in the Krzysztof Kieslowski trilogy. It was the colour that jarred the eye in Nagpur, with both Zimbabwe and Canada wearing similar hues of blood red. Such was the stark similarity in the colours that it felt as though only one team was playing. With Pakistan and Kenya also sporting a similar green, would it not be better for cricket to adopt the same approach as soccer, where a team has the option of first-choice and alternative colour to avoid any clashes? #p#The glaring miss. <m1>Tatenda Taibu tried a pre-meditated sweep against a full toss from Balaji Rao. The bottom edge bounced off his pads into no-man's land on the leg side, but the Canadians appealed for lbw and Asad Rauf readily raised his finger. Taibu instantly asked for the review and immediately, and correctly, got the decision reversed. The angle was straight, the ground was empty, it was close to noon and bright, but Rauf did not see or hear the edge. Thankfully, technology came to Taibu's rescue</m1> and did not create a debate like the one that angered India captain MS Dhoni on Saturday evening. #p#The winning hand. <m2>Ray Price pitched the ball on a length around off stump and Nitish Kumar, the youngest player in the tournament making his World Cup debut, hit an airy drive that seemed going towards mid-off. Price, who usually bowls from wide of the crease, was on his follow-through and just skipped a couple of yards further to his left to take a beauty with his outstretched left hand.</m2> #p#The Raspberry. <m3>John Davison, Canada's most experienced player. Canada expected a lot from him today but he was all smoke and no fire. Leave aside his bowling figures (7-0-56-0)</m3>, more disillusioning was <m4>his choice of shot against Price. Price was bowling his first over, the second over of the innings. To the third ball he faced, Davison stepped out and attempted a wristy flick over midwicket. Unfortunately for him, Price, having read the batsman's mind early, had given loop and Davison was beaten and bowled.</m4>
13	503330	Netherlands v West Indies, Group B, World Cup 2011, Delhi	West Indies must be wary of losing focus	The Preview by Andrew McGlashan	February 27, 2011	#p#Match Facts February 28, Delhi Start time 2.30 pm (0900 GMT) #p#Peter Borren will be quietly confident his team can give West Indies a tough challenge Associated Press Enlarge Related Links News : ten Doeschate looms as main threat News : West Indies look to convince the sceptics Matches: Netherlands v West Indies at Delhi Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Netherlands | West Indies #p#The Big Picture #p#These two teams began their World Cup campaigns with contrasting defeats. Netherlands' loss against England can safely be bracketed in the 'heroic' category, but West Indies' insipid performance against South Africa was depressingly familiar. This contest may not be the mismatch that the two line-ups suggested it should be. #p#On the evidence of their opening game, West Indies are going to find themselves fighting it out for the fourth qualifying spot from Group B alongside England and Bangladesh. Therefore this match is one they can't afford to take lightly especially after Netherlands showed they have the ability to make the major sides stand up and take notice. #p#Netherlands will fancy making another mark because they'll face a thin West Indian attack stripped down even further by the absence of Dwayne Bravo. If Ryan ten Doeschate can lead a display of similar resilience as they showed against England, setting a decent target, or chasing one down, may not be out of reach for the Dutch. #p#However, like England's class with the bat eventually came through against Netherlands' weak bowling resources, the same should apply to West Indies. Even with the loss of Bravo snr there is considerable batting power available led by Chris Gayle followed by the hugely talented Darren Bravo. But the tournament hasn't had an upset yet and West Indies will have to be careful they don't become the first victims. #p#Form guide (completed matches, most recent first) Netherlands LLLWL West Indies LLLLL #p#Watch out for... #p#Alexei Kervezee isn't a man short of confidence. He has announced his ambition to play for England and his performances for Worcestershire suggest that isn't out of reach. He didn't quite get going against his possible future team-mates in Nagpur before top-edging a pull to depart for 16 off 25 balls but he remains one of Netherlands' key batsmen. The Dutch can't rely on ten Doeschate to score hundreds each time he bats and Kervezee has the advantage of opening the batting, the ideal position for a strokemaker on the subcontinent. He'll want to leave a mark sooner rather than later. #p#West Indies are short on wicket-taking bowlers but in Kemar Roach they have one of the fastest on show at the World Cup. He's quicker than anything Netherlands faced against England and will test their courage and skill. It is vital to West Indies that Roach can take regular wickets during the tournament because there isn't much strike power behind him. A decent haul in this match would boost his confidence ahead of bigger challenges to come. #p#Team news #p#The indications are that Netherlands will stick to the eleven that pushed England so close last week even though the bowling was exposed. It's the lack of wicket-takers that is the biggest problem for a number of Associates and the pressure will be ten Doeschate with ball as well as bat. Pieter Seelaar, the left-arm spinner, looked reasonably handy in the opening game. #p#Netherlands (probable) 1 Alexei Kervezee, 2 Wesley Barresi (wk), 3 Tom Cooper, 4 Ryan ten Doeschate, 5 Bas Zuiderent, 6 Tom de Grooth, 7 Peter Borren (capt), 8 Mudassar Bukhari, 9 Pieter Seelaar, 10 Bernard Loots, 11 Berend Westdijk #p#West Indies are going to be forced to make at least one change after Dwayne Bravo was ruled out of the tournament with a knee injury. The suggestion is they will strengthen the spin-bowling department with a recall for left-armer Nikita Miller. The other option would be to bring in the pace of either Ravi Rampaul or Andre Russell. #p#West Indies (possible) 1 Chris Gayle, 2 Devon Smith, 3 Darren Bravo, 4 Ramnaresh Sarwan, 5 Shivnarine Chanderpaul, 6 Kieron Pollard, 7 Devon Thomas (wk), 8 Darren Sammy (capt), 9 Sulieman Benn, 10 Nikita Miller, 11 Kemar Roach #p#Pitch and conditions #p#Ottis Gibson, the West Indies coach, said he was surprised the pitch didn't slow up more against South Africa. There are also contrasting views on how important the dew factor will be - Peter Borren believes it will be a significant issue, but Darren Sammy is less bothered. #p#Stats and trivia #p#The two teams have only met once before at ODI level and West Indies cruised to a 10-wicket victory on neutral turf in Dublin in 2007. #p#Chris Gayle needs 81 runs to reach 8000 in ODIs #p#Ryan ten Doeschate has the highest ODI average of all time of 71.21, 13 runs ahead of the next best Hashim Amla. #p#Quotes #p#"It's pretty big sport in Holland, football. Some people were surprised that they made the final. It'll be nice if we could emulate that. It might be a bit more of a surprise if we did it." Peter Borren thinks it will be a while until cricket is a major sport in Netherlands #p#"Everyone in the team is responsible for our performance. I'm one of the allrounders and I should put my hand up and put in a good performance on the field." Darren Sammy knows he needs to lead from the front.
13	503374	Netherlands v West Indies, World Cup 2011, Group B, Delhi	West Indies look to convince the sceptics	Firdose Moonda in Delhi	February 27, 2011	#p#The West Indies squad formed a circle around the small field where they were going to do their fitness drills in Delhi. Two players took turns standing in the middle and hurling an inflated ball at their team-mates, who had to get out of the way or get hurt. They squealed and squirmed and amid the protests most managed to avoid being blasted in the end. #p#Not so when they are not in training. #p#The squad has been playing a figurative dodgeball with the media since the mid-90s and most times they get stung hard. Most of the international press don't have any positive feelings about the side, their ability, their commitment, their desire and their skills and nothing the players can say will change their minds. Those critics don't want justification, they want crucification, a forum to tell the men from the Caribbean, time and time again, that they have failed their predecessors and are simply not good enough. #p#This time it came as an accusation when a reporter said the West Indian batsmen were not prepared for South Africa opening the bowling with a spinner in their World Cup match on Thursday. "We were not caught off guard," Darren Sammy, the West Indies captain said. He was, of course, challenged on that statement. Why was Chris Gayle out after three balls if they weren't surprised? "These things happen in cricket," Sammy explained, before he attempted to justify further. "The second wicket pair put on a partnership of over 100." #p#None of it mattered, because the hyenas wanted more. The West Indies had only scored 222 in their first match of the tournament and hadn't even been able to bat out all fifty overs. The Netherlands, who they will play on Monday, managed to bat out their full allotment of overs and post 292 against England. Dodge that one, Darren. #p#Darren Sammy insists West Indies can cope with the loss of Dwayne Bravo AFP Enlarge #p#"They put on a good batting display against England. We saw how England bowled to them. We've been practicing hard in the nets. Our bowlers did their best defending 223 but we need a better batting and fielding performance." #p#Ah yes, that's what they want to hear: the West Indies admitting that they have to try harder and that they need to do more and that's it going to be difficult for them to do that. Already, the last part of that is fact because they are missing premier allrounder Dwayne Bravo, who injured his knee in the match against South Africa. "He covers two options for us, with bat and ball," Sammy said. "The other allrounders, and I am one of them, will have to put up their hands and put performances in on the field." #p#Sammy gave little indication suggesting who may replace Bravo. Having seen the South African spinners perform well on the Kotla pitch, he said that Nikita Miller "has a strong case for coming into the starting XI." That will leave them a batsman short given the lack of penetration in their attack, it may be more beneficial to have the extra bowler. #p#Bravo's loss is going to present the West Indies with this puzzle for the remainder of the tournament, they'll have to continually "rethink combinations" and will need to be able to rely on the top order batsmen like Chris Gayle and Darren Bravo even more than usual. It's a massive setback in their attempt to dodge more claims of incompetence, but it's one they are determined to turn into a positive. "Dwayne's injury will be an inspiration for us," Sammy said. "We've seen him give his heart for the West Indies and we are going to do the same." #p#It's a nice thought but not one that has anyone convinced that West Indies are serious about what they're here to do as could be heard from the snide sneers when that comment came out. Sammy became more serious, trying his best to put across that the knockouts are still in his team's sights. "Everyone in this team is responsible. We know what to expect. This is a must-win game for us."
13	503380	Netherlands v West Indies, World Cup 2011, Group B, Delhi	ten Doeschate looms as main threat	Firdose Moonda in Delhi	February 27, 2011	#p#If cricket was as big as international football is in the Netherlands, Ryan ten Doeschate may be remembered the same way Ryan Giggs is - a stand-out talent in a team that was always trying to punch above their weight. #p#ten Doeschate's hundred and 2 for 47 in the match against England are the only things people want to talk to the team about, as though the other 14 members of the squad don't exist, or if they do, they are mere minions and he is the Raja. For now, that's exactly what he is, being the current owner of the highest career batting average, 71. 21, and acts as the mascot for Dutch cricket. With him, the team must feel like anything is possible and Peter Borren said they are wary of being "too reliant" on him. #p#"Ryan's not going to score a hundred in every game of this World Cup, although it would be great if he did, but it's a big ask," Borren said. "We hope he does it every game, as I say, but if he doesn't we need someone to step up." #p#Tom Cooper came the closest to making that leap in the match against England and was part of the highest partnership of the innings - a 78-run third wicket stand with ten Doeschate. Cooper, who is from Australia, has an ODI average 63.60 and had scored three half-centuries and century in his first five ODIs. Most of his successes have come against associate opposition but having spent time on the Australian domestic circuit, his skills against players from bigger nations have been tested. #p#It's players like Cooper and Alex Kervezee, who like ten Doeschate was born in South Africa, that Borren was referring too when he that "the potential in our team for other guys to make big scores as well," exists. He understands that ten Doeschate will be the fulcrum around which the rest will rotate and hopes that he will fulfil the "anchor role" again. #p#Batting is the strength on which the Dutch are riding on, after they piled on the runs against England, may want to have the first knock against the West Indies, irrespective of conditions. "We batted first in the last game and got 290-odd and if we could do that again it wouldn't be a bad option," Borren said. #p#It will mean fielding under lights in Delhi, which will present a different challenge to the team than the one they faced in their first game. "In Nagpur the dew wasn't a factor, but we trained here last night and there is a bit of dew here in Delhi in the evening." #p#With all the focus on their own game, it may seem as though Netherlands have spared few thoughts for their opposition, West Indies. Borren discussed them on Saturday saying that his team knows the West Indies have "two or three of the most dangerous players in the world," at their disposal, and even without Dwayne Bravo they have "players who can do the job."

Gone was the intensity and discipline that spooked England as <m14>they allowed West Indies to saunter to victory with more than 18 overs left unused</m14>. #p#This was an important match for West Indies who, coming into it, looked in danger of being drawn into a qualification dogfight in Group B. If they are to beat Bangladesh to the quarters they need their big guns to fire and they would have been relieved that Chris Gayle and Kieron Pollard found their form before Roach's heroics. #p#Smart stats. <m15>The 215-run win</m15> is West Indies' biggest margin of victory in ODIs, going past their earlier record of 208 runs against Canada in Kingston last year. It's also the joint sixth-largest by any team in World Cup history. <m16>West Indies' total of 330</m16> is their second-highest in World Cups, and seventh-best in all ODIs. <m17>Kemar Roach's hat-trick</m17> is the 28th in ODI history, and the sixth in World Cups. He is also the first West Indian to achieve this feat in World Cups, and the second in all ODIs, after Jerome Taylor. Chetan Sharma, Saqlain Mushtaq, Chaminda Vaas, Brett Lee and Lasith Malinga are the others to take a hat-trick in World Cups. <m18>Roach's figures of 6 for 27</m18> are the fourth-best by a West Indian bowler in ODIs, and the second-best in World Cups, after Winston Davis' 7 for 51 against Australia in 1983. <m19>Keiron Pollard's 23-ball half-century</m19> is the joint fourth-fastest in terms of balls faced in World Cups. Brendon McCullum's 20-ball effort against Canada in 2007 is the fastest, while the next two belong to Mark Boucher in the same tournament: off 21 balls against Netherlands, and 22 balls against West Indies. #p#It was only <m20>a composed but futile 55 not out from Tom Cooper</m20> that dragged Netherlands past their lowest-ever ODI total - 80 against West Indies four years ago - in a showing that did themselves, and the beleaguered Associate brand, a total disservice. #p#<m21>Roach operated consistently around the 90mph mark and was happy to aim full at the stumps</m21> - a tactic shunned by England's bowlers against the same opposition - and Netherlands' batsmen were not up for a fight. #p#Though <m22>he took six wickets</m22>, the <m23>crucial, crushing blow was landed by towering left-arm-spinner Sulieman Benn</m23>. <m24>Ryan ten Doeschate, the hero against England and the sole player in the side with the quality to mount a challenge, was trapped low on the front pad and despite a long stride, and a review, he could not survive.</m24> Thereafter it was only Cooper who could resist Roach's pace. #p#The rot was set earlier in the day when <m25>Gayle made a measured 80</m25> and <m26>Pollard a 27-ball 60</m26> that carried West Indies out of sight. <m27>Pollard blended his immense power with the touch of savvy that has been absent from his 50-over game so far to bring up only his second ODI fifty</m27>. His assault gave a crowd deprived of much excitement something to cheer and emphatically confirmed that Borren's decision to field first on a pudding pitch and speedy outfield was the wrong one. #p#<m28>Devon Smith's silky fifty</m28> allowed Gayle plenty of time to rouse himself into the contest. At no stage were West Indies pinned down but <m29>it did take Gayle 24 deliveries to find the boundary</m29>. <m30>ten Doeschate's first over shattered his shackles as he drove three times through the covers, before collecting two more boundaries in the next over</m30>. He looked poised to explode from thereon but was instead <m31>content to coast and make the most of some generous Netherlands offerings.</m31> #p#The seam bowlers leaked runs both sides of the wicket and it was only the 23-year-old left-arm-spinner Pieter Seelaar who impressed. <m32>With an action and temperament similar to his touted Irish counterpart George Dockrell, Seelaar was happy to give the ball air and was rightly rewarded when Gayle holed out to long-off</m32>, one run shy of his 8000th in ODI cricket. #p#At that stage, two balls into <m33>the batting Powerplay</m33>, West Indies looked like suffering the same hoodoo that has infected many other teams throughout the tournament, but in Pollard they had the right man for the stage. There was the customary six-hitting, including <m34>a monstrous strike into the stands off Mudassar Bukhari</m34>, but there was plenty of nous too as he raced to <m35>his fifty from 23 balls</m35>, the joint fourth-quickest in World Cup history. #p#Given the stiff target Netherlands were unlikely to get near and Roach ensured West Indies overcame them in style. #p#Match Timeline

The fielders tumbled over it and each other and the innings was opened with a four.</m3> There were no problems with <m4>the second ball, which was driven through mid-off, almost with a thud</m4>. #p#The sleeping giant awakens. <m5>Chris Gayle had been batting with disdain for the better part of the first ten overs.</m5> He swatted at some balls with disinterest, pushed lightly at others with disparagement and shown a general apathy to being at the crease. Just when he looked ready to pack it all up and leave, he came to life. <m6>Holland's golden boy Ryan ten Doeschate had come on to bowl and Gayle hammered three of the first four balls he faced from him to the boundary.</m6> #p#The dropped catches. <m7>Ramnaresh Sarwan was given two lives</m7>. <m8>On 13, he drove lazily in the air to the Alexei Kervezee on the sweeper boundary. Kervezee was right behind it and tried to catch with it with his fingers up, but instead of curling them around the ball, he used them like fly swats and spilled it.</m8> <m9>Six overs later Bukhari, who was the bowler when Sarwan was dropped the first time, should have caught him this time. Sarwan skied it high above the wicketkeeper and Wesley Baressi, and the fielders at third man and fine leg, swooped on the chance. Bukhari called, Baressi stepped back, and instead of the ball being safely caught it ended up like an egg, splattered all over the floor. Bukhari was the culprit, spilling it as he went down on his knees.</m9> #p#The Bajan inspiration. Two of the 15 West Indies players are from Barbados and they seem to enjoy celebrating to the music from a lady from their island. <m10>Each time Kemar Roach or Sulieman Benn took a wicket, nine times in total</m10>, Rihanna's "Rude Boy" would blast from the stadium speakers. The song wasn't played during the match against South Africa and it also didn't get any airtime when the only other bowler among the wickets, Darren Sammy, claimed his scalp. Bajan beats for Bajan "rude" boys only. #p#The hat-trick. It was going only one way for Netherlands but they were determined to hold on by their fingernails until the end. <m11>Kemar Roach put them out of their misery and chopped the whole hand off with the first hat-trick</m11> of this World Cup. <m12>His first victim was Pieter Seelaar, who was struck flush on the pad, beaten by the pace that Roach had used all evening.</m12> Then, <m13>it was Bernard Loots' turn. He couldn't get away from the ball that nipped in and was hit just in front of off stump.</m13> <m14>The third one didn't hit the pad as Roach finished off the way any bowler would want to - by flattening middle stump with another incutter.</m14> <m15>It was the sixth hat-trick in World Cup history</m15>.

Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: Kieron Pollard Matches: Netherlands v West Indies at Delhi Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Netherlands | West Indies #p#Kieron Pollard is a giant in India. He was greeted, for the second match in succession at the Feroz Shah Kotla, with the loudest roar of the match. Truth be told, he'd be a giant anywhere in the world, but in India, where someone the size of Sachin Tendulkar is the real giant, things are judged on a different scale. #p#His giant badge was probably pinned on him after his 18-ball 54 for Trinidad and Tobago during the Champions League T20 2009 and stuck with him through his travels in 20-over cricket - from South Australia to Somerset. #p#What he isn't, is an international giant in any meaningful way beyond the physical. The promise and the potential of becoming one hovers somewhere above him, somewhere just out of his reach, large as that reach is, and he has never quite grabbed it. In his international career of 33 ODIs, he had, before today, scored a half-century once and boasted an underwhelming average of less than 20, statistics not befitting a man who is painted as one of the most fearsome hitters of the ball on the current circuit. #p#He can bludgeon a ball, make no mistake, smack it so cleanly that even the poor round object itself wants to stay nestled in whatever stand, tree or floor somewhere far outside the stadium, for fear of getting the treatment again. He can do that, but what's the use it if he can only do it once or twice in an innings of fifty overs? #p#That's the doubt that's going to continually creep up on Pollard and will only start to retreat if he plays many more innings like the one he played against Netherlands with equally good, if not even better, results. #p#It started in that same scary fashion, with <m2>the second ball he faced sailing for six</m2> even though he didn't seem to hit it all that hard. It was just a case of making the right contact at the right time and the ball was experiencing life as a shooting star. #p#What came next was almost the entire magazine of a gun, flipped to automatic, shooting bullets wildly. There was <m3>the violent flick past short leg</m3>, <m4>the prod that was really a powerful push over extra cover</m4>, <m5>the full toss that was given its rightful punishment</m5> and <m6>the six</m6> that seemed like a mighty oaf had plucked a grape out of the air and flung it into anther galaxy. It was typical Pollard, bruising and belligerent, with not a care in the world. #p#On another day, he would have exhausted that magazine then and there, lost interest with shooting the target and got out shortly afterwards, but having walked in with <m7>the West Indies on 196 for 3</m7> and knowing that there was not that much at stake, something was different. #p#<m8>His next boundary, a four, actually had a hint of finesse, a sprinkling of delicacy and more than a few dashes of timing. He used his wrists the way a whirling dervish does, flowingly, and steered the ball past the man at short fine-leg, placing it perfectly so that it found the spot he wanted it to. It was one shot of pure elegance.</m8> #p#He soon deferred back to fierce mode and continued smashing and flashing. He was helped by the balls the Netherlands bowlers gave him; too short, too wide, too full and sometimes too inviting and he played the role that we've become so used to seeing him in. Then the bullets stopped firing, <m9>he mistimed one and, as he so often does, found a fielder in the deep</m9>. #p#It would be easy to read too much into this innings because Pollard was able to play with a freedom not often afforded him. That he used it to get to a reasonable score only to toss it away when he'd had enough summed up what has held back his career. However, that he used it to score <m10>13 singles</m10>, showed progression. Small progression, but the kind that shows, like Chris Gayle did earlier, a genuine attempt at hanging around and building an innings. #p#In the end, the substance of Pollard's knock was not too different from the one he played against Australia just over a year ago, when, with the team on a hiding to nothing, he had scored 62. He took more singles then, with just six boundaries in his 54 balls, but it was against a much more threatening bowling attack that would not have given him as many opportunities to clear the rope. Then, just as he did tonight, he went down in a blaze of glory attempting one big hit too many. #p#If he can somehow save that <m11>one big hit too many</m11> for the very end of the innings, after he has already added something substantial as he did tonight and did once before, then he will find his international giant status will grow very quickly, not just India, but all around the cricketing world.

Players/Officials: Kemar Roach Matches: Netherlands v West Indies at Delhi Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Netherlands | West Indies #p#West Indies came sashaying back into this World Cup with a performance so calypso it was a pina colada for the eyes. It had flamboyant batting, destructive bowling, over-the-top celebrations and that essential ingredient, something orange that had been turned to pulp. #p#The colour was provided by Netherlands, who came into this match on a high, anticipating a decent performance after their competitive showing against England. Ryan ten Doeschate's century had propped them up comfortably, and even though they weren't able to secure victory with the ball, they had shown a determination beyond their minnow status. They had arrived in Delhi with a real base on which to start from. #p#They came to the capital with so much to live up to, so much promise, so much expectation and so much belief that they were going to compete in the tournament. Against West Indies, they were even spoken about as competing as equals. In a daze of hype, it looked as though the Dutch forgot that beyond the confidence and the positivity, they would actually have to turn up and play, before any of that became a reality. #p#They had spoken about an improved performance in the field, which they were not able to execute half as well as they talked about. Even though batting has been their strength, without getting the other half of their game to work, it's negated. Peter Borren had no answers, no excuses and by the looks of it, no motivation at the end of the match. #p#After the game, his one statement summed up an evening that left his team gutted. "If we are going to bat and bowl and field as poorly as we did today, it actually makes no difference if we bat or field first." With that empty statement, and the hollow expression that accompanied it, he left the room. It's going to take a lot for Netherlands to pick themselves up from <m3>this demoralising defeat</m3>, and they only have three days to figure out how to. #p#For West Indies, the three days between games can't be over with soon enough. After their initial defeat to South Africa, their 12th in succession, the critics were saying the same thing: that the West Indians were not good enough and would have to battle for their place in the quarter-finals. Then, albeit against an associate side, all the big guns fired. <m4>Chris Gayle and Kieron Pollard belted out half-centuries</m4> and <m5>Kemar Roach, their premier strike bowler, ended up with 6 for 27</m5>, including <m6>the tournament's first hat-trick</m6>. #p#Roach said the victory buoyed the team, particularly for their next challenge in Dhaka. "We take a lot of confidence into the game against Bangladesh," he said. "This match was good preparation for the Bangladesh game. We'll go there on a high. Bangladesh are an improving team but we are better than them." #p#That kind of confidence is rare for a current West Indian bowler, especially because bowling is considered their weak link, with some suggesting that they would always need big runs because they would struggle to bowl sides out. Roach, who often operates as the lone strike bowler, said that although being a seamer in the subcontinent is challenging, he is adapting. "It's tough coming here as a bowler to the subcontinent, you have to be very accurate and consistent, once you get that right, you get wickets." #p#<m7>Roach opened the bowling with spinner Sulieman Benn</m7> in the last two matches, and even though West Indies were renowned for hunting in fast-bowling pairs, he said he doesn't miss not having another quick on the other end. "I don't feel as though as I am left out. Benn is a very good partner of mine. To see that two guys from Barbados are opening the bowling for the West Indies is great." #p#Although Ravi Rampaul and Andre Russell are waiting in the wings to add to the seam contingent, Roach is happy to carry the load, with Kieron Pollard to help out, if he has to. Roach has been particularly inspired by a message the injured allrounder Dwayne Bravo gave him. "He is my big brother. He said go hard and enjoy it and be confident in whatever you do."
13	503653			Nikhil Jha		Choice of game. I know you'll be thinking about the magnitude of my joblessness, considering I turned up for such a match on a Monday. Particularly, since I do not have any connection to either team. But considering the lack of political and corporate connections or one-in-a-million lottery luck, the only things that could get me tickets, I decided to take what I could get. The World Cup was in town after all!  #p# Netherlands' encouraging performance against England raised hopes of this being a good match. I also wanted to see the West Indian stars in action, particularly Darren Bravo, and judge for myself if the resemblance with the great Brian Lara is justified.  #p# Plus I had a personal score to settle with Ramnaresh Sarwan, whose last-ball four at a match I was at in Jamshedpur, led to infamous bottle-throwing mayhem.  #p# Team supported. My Dutch allegiance is quite well known within my circle of friends, and becomes obvious when you see the amount of orange in my wardrobe. However, I wondered if I could extend the support I reserve for the descendants of the legendary Johan Cruyff to the cricket team. My visit to Netherlands made me fall in love with the country and threatened to mask my cricketing judgement. Considering all that, I was a neutral, but I would have been happier to see the Dutch win.  #p# World Cup prediction. Before the tournament started, I would not have thought twice before shouting "India!" along with millions of other fans. Now having seen the other top teams like Australia, South Africa and Sri Lanka play, and Pakistan rise to the occasion, along with our bowling miseries, I'm having second thoughts.  #p# I will still let the fan inside me overpower the cricketing logic, and yell "India!"  #p# Key performer. Everyone chipped in for West Indies: Devon Smith and Chris Gayle at the top of the order, followed by Sarwan. But the one guy who blasted the bowling attack and brought some life into the sparse crowd  was Kieron Pollard. <m1>His power-hitting also came when West Indies had lost wickets at the start of the Powerplay</m1>, and took the total from big to imposing.  #p# <m2>Kemar Roach, with his hat-trick</m2> and <m3>six wickets</m3>, was the bowling star, but you would have to think that West Indies would have won regardless.   #p# One thing I'd have changed.  I would have loved it if Delhi had hosted the match that went to Bangalore, so I could experience that thrilling encounter rather than this mismatch. However, if my wishes are restricted to this match, I really hoped that Ryan ten Doeschate would produce another of his blinders and that this match would at least be entertaining.  #p# Wow moment. The game and the sparse crowd in attendance were hardly capable of producing a wow moment. But I must mention the beautiful sight that a cricket ground presents from the top tiers once the lights take full effect. It looks like a flawless green carpet, shining in milky limelight, with the players at the centre of it. A sight to behold.  #p# Shot of the day. A tough choice between a classic cricket shot and a crowd-pleasing monstrous hit. <m4>Bravo showed traces of that legendary touch, with a trademark silky drive early in his innings.</m4> But the shot that stood out was <m5>the massive six that Pollard hit, which almost knocked off one of the flags on the top tier of stands.</m5> Amazing power!  #p# Crowd meter. The attendance, as you would expect, was dismal. The spectators comprised some school and college students, some curious people living nearby, some foreigners looking for a good time, and various competition prize winners. More people came in in the evening, just in time to watch Pollard go berserk. The biggest cheers were reserved for the IPL hero, and the handfuls of spectators egged him on to hit a six in their direction.  #p# Fancy-dress index. None, really, but later in the evening some excited college students turned up with India flags and indulged in an extended photo shoot, holding the flags in a number of different poses, probably trying to get that perfect Facebook display picture.  #p# Entertainment. The music was diverse: popular recent hits by the Black Eyed Peas and Rihanna, stock stadium songs by Queen and Chumbawamba, the Holi-themed "Rang Barse", and the inexplicable local cult song "Chandigarh Kare Aashiqui"   #p# Banner of the day. There was one, brought in by a bunch of schoolkids, that read "West Indies batsmen, please go Dutch" Cute try, but I don't think it quite qualifies as funny.  #p# ODIs v Twenty20. Being a cricket purist, I would have loved to say Test matches. Since that is not an option, I'll have to say Twenty20s because ODIs seem to be stuck in a "neither here nor there" kind of purgatory zone. If I want to see cricket, I'll go watch Test matches, but for entertainment value, Twenty20s beat ODIs (though this is a brave statement in the face of the India v England game the other night!)  #p# Marks out of 10. 5. It wasn't much of a match, but considering the fine individual performances, it qualifies for 5.
14	503565	Sri Lanka v Kenya, Group A, World Cup 2011, Colombo	Kenya hope to avoid mismatch	The Preview by Sidharth Monga	February 28, 2011	#p#Match Facts March 1, Colombo Start time 14:30 local time (09:00 GMT) #p#Kenya's team is significantly weaker than the one that beat Sri Lanka in 2003 AFP Enlarge Related Links News : 'Malinga is fit' - Bayliss Matches: Sri Lanka v Kenya at Colombo (RPS) Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Kenya | Sri Lanka #p#Big Picture #p#The last time Sri Lanka played Kenya in a World Cup, they did so despite security concerns in the country, choosing not to follow New Zealand, who forfeited their game in Nairobi. No amount of concerns over security would have prepared Sri Lanka for what happened: a shocking 53-run defeat against a spirited home side. It was 2003, and to borrow from the pop-sport anthem, it was time for Africa. Kenya were a seriously good side then, and would have had every right to feel indignant about not being a Test side. Eight years on, their side well and truly reflects the political turmoil the country has gone through, and the general neglect of the sport. Suffice to say, no such upset can be fantasised about this time. #p#Sri Lanka, on the other hand, have gone from strength to strength since 2003. All they will want is for the Colombo rains - which are never too far away any time of the year - to stay away, and then notch up the two points by playing solid cricket. There will be disappointment after Sri Lanka lost to Pakistan. It could result in the hosts having to play a better team in the quarter-final than they would ideally want, but there aren't many teams who can claim to have faced the ghosts that appear only under the Premadasa floodlights, and lived to tell the tale. #p#Form guide (Most recent first) #p#Sri Lanka LWWWL #p#Kenya LLWLW #p#Pitch and conditions #p#Scattered thunderstorms are predicted for Tuesday, but that is hardly unusual for Colombo. The weathermen say chance of precipitation is 60%. Now that becomes slightly gloomy. Be that as it may, the game should become interesting if Kenya get to bat first and set Sri Lanka a fighting target under the lights. The pitch, though, hardly holds any demons otherwise. #p#Watch out for  #p#In his 15th year of international cricket, Thomas Odoyo is still going strong. His opening spell against Pakistan was the only positive Kenya could take away from their first game of the World Cup. They will need much more from him to compete against Sri Lanka. #p#Considering how successful Shahid Afridi's spin was against the Kenya batsmen, Muttiah Muralitharan could be in for a wicket-fest too. #p#Team news #p#Sri Lanka, strong favourites to win the World Cup, had one problem area when they started out. They have the class of Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene and Nos. 3 and 4, and the hitting prowess of Angelo Mathews and Thisara Perera in the lower order. The link between them, though, gets exposed every now and then. Chamara Silva's fifty against Pakistan, though, might just mean he is the lesser of the evils. The other Chamara, Kapugedera, doesn't have the results to match the flair he seeks to exhibit. Lasith Malinga is reportedly fit but whether he will play is not yet certain. #p#Sri Lanka : (probable): 1 Tillakaratne Dilshan, 2 Upul Tharanga, 3 Kumar Sangakkara (capt & wk), 4 Mahela Jayawardene, 5 Chamara Silva, 6 Thilan Samaraweera, 7 Angelo Mathews, 8 Thisara Perera, 9 Nuwan Kulasekara, 10 Ajantha Mendis, 11 Muttiah Muralitharan. #p#Kenya : 1 Maurice Ouma, 2 Seren Waters, 3 Colins Obuya, 4 Steve Tikolo, 5 Tanmay Mishra, 6 Rakep Patel, 7 Jimmy Kamande, 8 Thomas Odoyo, 9 Nehemiah Odhiambo, 10 Shem Ngoche, 11 Elijah Otieno. #p#Try picking the XIs for tomorrow's game by playing Team Selector. #p#Stats and trivia #p#This is Steve Tikolo's fifth World Cup, and he possesses an all-round record that not many from stronger sides will mind - 739 runs and 15 wickets. #p#Although Sri Lanka co-hosted the 1996 World Cup, this is only the second World Cup game being played at the Premadasa. Australia and West Indies forfeited their Colombo matches back in 1996 because of security concerns. #p#Tikolo is six short of becoming only the second Kenyan to take 100 ODI wickets, after Odoyo. #p#Quotes #p#"Sri Lanka look solid up there, but we have nothing to lose. They are the ones who would be under pressure to perform at home, and now obviously having lost to Pakistan, it's a must win game for them tomorrow." Jimmy Kamande plays the underdogs card. #p#"Lasith bent over to pick up a cricket ball about two weeks ago and strained his back a little. He bowled in the last two practice sessions. He has bowled with a full run-up today and batted and fielded. We have a selection meeting in the evening and will decide what to do then." Trevor Bayliss , Sri Lanka's coach, on Malinga's fitness.
14	503595	Sri Lanka v Kenya, Group A, World Cup 2011, Colombo	Kamande rubbishes rift rumours	ESPNcricinfo staff	February 28, 2011	#p#Kenya captain Jimmy Kamande has rubbished reports of a rift between his players and their West Indian coach Eldine Baptiste, saying it was just an excuse people were looking for because the team has been performing poorly. On Sunday, Cricket Kenya chief Samir Inamdar had said some of the senior players were not happy with Baptiste, but Kamande said there were no such problems. #p#"I have read it like you. My team is very, very solid. We all are together as one," he told AFP. "When the team loses, people try to find excuses, but there are none on those lines, just that we haven't performed well so far and will try to do well in the rest of the games." #p#Kenya lost their opening two games to New Zealand and Pakistan, results that were expected, but it was the margins of victory and the lacklustre performance of Kenya's batsmen that have drawn criticism. They were bowled out for 69 against New Zealand in Chennai, and got to just 112 in their chase against Pakistan in Hambantota. Inamdar said the board was disappointed with the results and wanted the team to at least be competitive against the Test playing nations. #p#Kenya captain Jimmy Kamande said there would be changes, perhaps in the batting order AFP Enlarge #p#Kamande said there would be changes and his team would try to bounce back by getting the basics right. "We don't want to complicate the game of cricket. Obviously we haven't been on top form, but some changes have to be made; maybe in the batting order. We can't continue doing the same thing." #p#Things don't get any easier for Kenya, as their next match is against tournament co-hosts and favourites Sri Lanka, on Tuesday at the Premadasa Stadium in Colombo. Sri Lanka lost their last game, against Pakistan, and Kamande said that would put them under pressure. #p#"Sri Lanka look solid up there, but we have nothing to lose. They are the ones who would be under pressure to perform at home and now obviously having lost to Pakistan it's a must-win game for them. We will try to put some pressure on them and bowl at a nice tight line and length and if we do it will add problems for the Sri Lankan side." #p#Kenya upset Sri Lanka in the 2003 World Cup, but have lost the other four ODIs they have played against Sri Lanka.
14	503621	Sri Lanka v Kenya, Group A, World Cup 2011, Colombo	'Malinga is fit' - Bayliss	Sa'adi Thawfeeq in Colombo	February 28, 2011	#p#Lasith Malinga, the Sri Lanka fast bowler is available for selection for their World Cup, Group A game against Kenya on Tuesday, according to the team's coach Trevor Bayliss. Malinga, who created a world record at the 2007 World Cup by capturing four wickets off four balls in Sri Lanka's game against South Africa, missed his team's first two matches in this edition due to a sore back. #p#But at the media conference on Monday, Bayliss said: "Malinga is available for selection. His physio told us that the first two weeks were the most important and those are up tomorrow. Malinga is fit and it is up to the selectors to pick him or not for tomorrow's match." #p#Malinga's absence in the bowling line-up was clearly felt when Pakistan ran up 277 for 7 and went on to beat Sri Lanka by 11 runs on Saturday. #p#Sri Lanka team manager Anura Tennekoon said Malinga would play against Kenya to give him much-needed match practice ahead of a crucial game against Australia on Saturday. If Malinga does play, either Thisara Perera or Nuwan Kulasekara will have to make room. #p#Coach Bayliss said Sri Lanka did not play to their potential against Pakistan and they would come out in full force to prove a point. "I thought the other night against Pakistan we played some very good cricket for lots of the match. There were a couple of periods where we didn't play as well as we would have liked. Our guys know we can play a lot better than that. I am sure they will be out to show how good they can play in the match against Kenya tomorrow." #p#Lasith Malinga has been bowling in the nets, but did not feature in Sri Lanka's first two World Cup games AFP Enlarge #p#The match between Sri Lanka and Pakistan was a close affair, and along with the thrilling tie between India and England on Sunday, gave the World Cup a much-needed lift after a dour start. "Both teams I think probably thought that they should have won," Bayliss said of Saturday's game. "Both teams at different stages probably thought they might lose. It was a good game; one of those good games to be involved in. It was very good for the tournament as a whole." #p#Sri Lanka are overwhelming favourites for the match against Kenya, who have looked out of their depth in the World Cup so far. But Bayliss ensured his team were not taking anyone for granted. "I am sure they [Kenya] will like to put in a better performance than they have done in the last couple of games. Certainly our guys will not be taking Kenya lightly. That's for sure." #p#One of the key areas Sri Lanka will concentrate on is building partnerships, the absence of which resulted in their defeat to Pakistan. Their batting line-up is unlikely to change but they may rest Muttiah Muralitharan and play the other two spinners: Rangana Herath and Ajantha Mendis. #p#Bayliss also praised the Premadasa pitch and said that it was the best pitch he's seen in the four years he has been coach.
14	503670	World Cup 2011	Sri Lanka v Kenya, Group A, Colombo	ESPNcricinfo staff	March 1, 2011	#p#Over-by-over
14	503673		'Chasing at Premadasa no longer difficult'	Mahela Jayawardene	March 1, 2011	On pitches favourable for batting, Lasith Malinga gives Sri Lanka a strong attacking option. AFP Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: Mahela Jayawardene Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Sri Lanka #p#We always knew the game against Pakistan was going to be a good contest. It was going to be tough for the quick bowlers on that track, especially during the day when it was flat and not doing much. We weren't disciplined enough in the execution of our plans in the first 10 to 15 overs. We gave away quite a few easy boundaries, so that is an area we will definitely address. #p#Younis Khan and Misbah-ul-Haq are two experienced players and they built the Pakistan innings after the loss of three wickets. They steadied the innings, didn't take too many risks and set it up nicely for the big hitters down the order. But our spinners did well and the seamers came back strongly in the latter part of the innings, not allowing those big hitters to flourish. #p#Where we lost it was with the bat. Losing those three wickets in quick time - Tillakaratne Dilshan, myself and Thilan Samaraweera for 8 - probably cost us. Shahid Afridi bowled really well during that middle period, taking four wickets, and that spell proved crucial. We tried to build the innings through Chamara Silva and Kumar Sangakkara, and the lower order had a good run, but we left it too late. With the required-rate creeping over 10, it was going to be tough but in the end we fell short by just 11 runs, so there were some positives we could take out from the game. #p#Chasing under lights at the Premadasa is no longer that difficult. The floodlights were one of the reasons teams struggled to chase at night at the ground, as they couldn't pick the ball on occasion. Since the revamp, with new lights and a re-laid track, things have certainly eased out. Earlier, teams used to have difficulty chasing even 220 but now the toss is not going to play a major factor unless the track deteriorates drastically. But, nevertheless, to chase under lights, once a team puts a score up on the board, there's going to be pressure. That's the only scenario to be worried about but the other elements are not a factor anymore. #p#We're only going to get batting-friendly pitches this tournament. The only way going forward will be to try and control the batsmen. To do that, you need to have attacking options in your armoury. The Australians are playing to their strengths, using pace as a means of attack. They might flourish in certain conditions, in others they might not. The important thing is to have bowlers who can pick up wickets, particularly when the tracks are flat and it's easy to score 300. We're hoping for Lasith Malinga to get back into his stride, with that we'll have enough bowling options in the side to pick up wickets. #p#With our batting, we're trying to establish a rhythm. Chamara Silva missed out in the first game because he had a family bereavement a few days earlier, and we gave him a week off. He's been a big part of the middle order and was part of the last World Cup, that experience is vital for us going forward. It's good to have him back and score some runs against Pakistan. Angelo Mathews - when and how we're going to use him in the batting line-up - is also going to be a key factor. Samaraweera brings solidity to our middle order. There is, of course, Chamara Kapugedera, and there's the option of him coming in depending on whom we're playing and what kind of tactics we use for different opposition. It's a settled middle order - it hasn't really had much opportunity because the top order has been getting a bulk of the runs. I do hope that when they get that opportunity, they'll come to the party and have a good workout. #p#Against Kenya, we just need to play to our strengths. We did that against Canada as well. That'll be the main focus, rather than worry about anything else.

Scorecard and ball-by-ball details #p#Kenya had no answer to Lasith Malinga. AFP Enlarge Related Links News : Failure to bat 50 overs worries Kamande. News : 'Malinga is fit' - Bayliss Players/Officials: Lasith Malinga Matches: Sri Lanka v Kenya at Colombo (RPS) Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Kenya | Sri Lanka #p#<m8>Lasith Malinga announced his return to full fitness by storming his way to an unprecedented second World Cup hat-trick</m8> with an exhibition of yorker-on-demand bowling that proved too much for Kenya's tail at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo. <m9>The visitors imploded to 142 all out</m9> despite <m10>dogged half-centuries from the Obuya brothers</m10>, who enjoyed plenty of fortune in a determined <m11>94-run stand</m11> that kept the varied threats of Sri Lanka's bowling at bay for nearly 30 overs. <m12>Sri Lanka's batsmen barely had to break a sweat in the chase, finishing it off in 18 overs</m12>. #p#Smart Stats. Lasith Malinga became the only bowler to pick up two hat-tricks in World Cups. His previous one had come against South Africa in 2007. So far, six bowlers have taken a hat-trick in World Cups. This was also the first instance of bowlers taking hat-tricks in consecutive matches in a World Cup. The 2003 World Cup was the last edition to see two hat-tricks. <m13>Malinga's 6 for 38</m13> is the second-best bowling figures by a Sri Lankan bowler in World Cups, behind Chaminda Vaas' 6 for 25 against Bangladesh in 2003. <m14>The 94-run stand between David Obuya and Collins Obuya</m14> is the fourth-best for Kenya for the third wicket in World Cups. Apart from David Obuya and Collins Obuya, the rest of the batsmen failed to reach double figures and aggregated just 20 runs among them. From a decent position of <m15>120 for 3</m15>, <m16>Kenya lost the last seven wickets for just 22 runs</m16> to be <m17>bowled out for 142</m17>. David Obuya's strike-rate of 48.11 and Collins Obuya's strike-rate of 52 are third and seventh on the list of lowest strike-rates for scores between 50 and 99 in World Cups. The lowest is Ishwar Maraj's 53 off 155 balls, at a strike-rate of 34.19 against South Africa in 2003. <m18>The 188 dot-balls in the Kenya innings</m18> is the second-highest in the 2011 World Cup, behind the 194 dots in Canada's innings against Zimbabwe. <m19>Sri Lanka's nine-wicket win over Kenya was achieved with 188 balls to spare</m19>. This is third on the list of victories with most balls to spare for Sri Lanka in World Cups. #p#The Obuyas weren't exactly convincing - testing every edge of their bat, surviving close lbw calls, regularly air-driving outside off and rarely reading the spinner's variations - but hung on obdurately to take Kenya into triple-digits. A solid platform was in place when they had <m20>hauled Kenya to 102 for 2</m20>, but <m21>Malinga's burst demolished the tail as the final eight wickets were blasted out for 40 runs</m21>. None of the other Kenyan batsmen made it past single-figures. #p#The Kenyan collapse was rapid: it took only 22 deliveries for them to go from <m22>127 for 4</m22> to <m23>being bowled out</m23>. <m24>Muttiah Muralitharan started it off by getting the set batsman David Obuya to slog-sweep to midwicket.</m24> #p#Then it was Malinga time. <m25>Jimmy Kamande barely found his bearings after being struck by a toe-crusher, and decided to go for a single when the ball was only a couple of metres away from him. Chamara Silva pounced from midwicket and did a passable imitation of Jonty Rhodes from 1992 to crash into the stumps and dismiss Kamande.</m25> #p#<m26>Tanmay Mishra was next, becoming the first victim of Malinga's hat-trick after missing a full delivery on leg stump to fall for a 13-ball duck</m26>. It was the final ball of the over, and <m27>Malinga gave Peter Ongondo the warmest welcome possible to the tournament in the first ball of his next - a yorker that uprooted middle.</m27> The staggered dismissals meant many in the crowd weren't aware that Malinga was on a hat-trick. <m28>He steamed in and middle stump was dismantled again next ball, the clueless batsman this time was Shem Ngoche.</m28> #p#<m29>Attention then shifted to whether Malinga could repeat his outrageous four-in-four from the 2007 World Cup, but he sprayed a wild delivery for five leg-side wides</m29>. <m30>Elijah Otieno defended the next ball, but that was followed by another unstoppable yorker from Malinga that thud into leg stump to end Kenya's innings.</m30> <m31>Malinga had taken four in five legal deliveries to finish with 6 for 38</m31>. #p#A tiresomely familiar tale seemed set to play out earlier in the afternoon when <m32>Kenya slid to 8 for 2 in the third over</m32>. Nuwan Kulasekara and Malinga removed the openers cheaply with their favourite weapons - <m33>Kulasekara getting Maurice Ouma with an inducker</m33>, and <m34>Malinga dislodging Seren Waters with an inswinging yorker that left the batsman on his knees</m34>. #p#The Obuyas ensured there wasn't a repeat of Kenya's house-of-cards performance against New Zealand. <m35>Kulasekara gave away only nine runs in a constricting six-over opening spell</m35>, but Kenya were more at ease against <m36>Angelo Mathews, who was taken for a couple of boundaries</m36>. #p#<m37>Sri Lanka brought on the spin of Ajantha Mendis in the 14th over</m37> to break <m38>the frustrating stand</m38>, but though the batsmen weren't sure which way the ball would turn, they survived his bag of tricks with some dour defence. Kumar Sangakkara then turned to Muttiah Muralitharan to get the wickets, but though there were leading edges and outside edges, <m39>Murali couldn't break through, with the batsmen negotiating him with a series of sweeps</m39>. #p#It was painfully slow progress from the Obuyas, and after more than two hours of defiance, <m40>it was that most deadly of weapons that separated them - a Malinga yorker</m40>. Some more of those left Sri Lanka chasing a tiny target in front of a raucous Colombo crowd. #p#The fans had even more to cheer when Sri Lanka batted, as <m41>Tillkaratne Dilshan provided a typically fast start with an array of punches through cover</m41>. <m42>He picked up a couple of boundaries in three successive overs</m42> to power <m43>Sri Lanka to 51 in the sixth over</m43>. <m44>Upul Tharanga, who started sedately, then joined the party with three fours in the next over.</m44> <m45>Dilshan fell short of a half-century</m45>, but <m46>Tharanga went on to make 67</m46> with <m47>a string of lofted boundaries</m47> in <m48>the batting Powerplay</m48> to hasten the finish, and push Sri Lanka to the top of the table on net run-rate. #p#Match Timeline
14	503761	Sri Lanka v Kenya, Group A, World Cup 2011, Colombo	Failure to bat 50 overs worries Kamande	Osman Samiuddin at the Premadasa	March 1, 2011	#p#For 94 runs and nearly 30 overs Kenya clung on. The brothers Obuya, Collins and David, kept out Muttiah Muralitharan and Ajantha Mendis building a mirage of a platform. The late-overs boost was never going to materialise, but <m1>two fifties</m1> - well-made ones in fact - was a small triumph in a tournament of batting misery. #p#<m2>A total of 142 all out</m2> is improvement of some kind on previous scores of 69 and 112 but as the captain Jimmy Kamande said later, it was nowhere close to being good enough. "I thought [David and Collins] batted very well, but they didn't bat through and that's the only thing we needed to do today. One of the batsmen who was settled in must bat through 50 overs, but we couldn't do that." #p#Either side of that stand, Kenya were blown aside by <m3>Lasith Malinga, whose hat-trick</m3> sealed off a collapse of <m4>eight wickets for just 40 runs</m4>. The brothers and <m5>extras (19)</m5> were the only double-figure scores in the entire innings. In their defence, Kenya are not the first side to fall to Malinga. #p#"It's not easy to face him," Kamande said. "It's always been a difficult one, a big challenge because Malinga is a different type of style and technique. But we are here to do the job which we didn't do. Our big concern is we are not batting out our 50 overs. That's the one area we want to work on very, very hard because you can't win matches without batting your full quota of overs. #p#<m6>Kenya's 142</m6> is their highest score in three games. AFP Enlarge #p#"The wicket looked solid for batting but the only difference was <m7>the spell that Malinga came out to bowl</m7>. Maybe we were a bit slow in our batting, but that was also because of tight bowling from Sri Lanka and batting under lights is not something which Kenyans are used to so I thought batting first was the best option." #p#The upside for Kenya is that two of their next three games, against Zimbabwe and Canada, are ones they will expect to win. "Playing Sri Lanka and playing against Pakistan, those two games were very, very tough for us because both are top Test sides," Kamande said. They now travel to Delhi to take on Canada on March 7, for what Kamande said was a "must-win" game for the side. #p#Not helping matters has been the environment in which the game was played, soon after comments from Kenya's chief Samir Inamdar who said recently that differences between the coach Eldine Baptiste and senior players had affected the side's performances. #p#As he did prior to the game, Kamande played down the comments, insisting that the unit was "very solid together." "The whole squad I know is giving is 110 per cent," Kamande said. "You don't need to tell anyone you need to perform against Canada. After all these tough matches against Test sides that's what we need to show, that we have learnt from them. Canada have also suffered big defeats and we know they will also come hard at us and that's what we should be prepared for."

AFP Enlarge Related Links News : Role of fast bowlers more important - Waqar. Players/Officials: Lasith Malinga Matches: Sri Lanka v Kenya at Colombo (RPS) Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Sri Lanka #p#Sri Lanka fast bowler, Lasith Malinga, who became the first bowler in World Cup history to take two hat-tricks, has said that he learnt to bowl his deadly yorkers by watching Pakistan's legendary pair of Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis. <m2>Malinga ran through the hapless Kenya batting to take a career best 6 for 38 runs</m2>, and pick up the Man-of-the-Match award, as the opposition crumbled under his assault for <m3>a mere 142 runs.</m3> #p#"This is a slow pitch and bouncers will not work so I decided to go for yorkers," Malinga said. "I didn't have any idea of how to bowl a yorker when I first came into the national team but I was taught how to bowl them by Champaka Ramanayake and Rumesh Ratnayake (two former Sri Lanka fast bowlers). #p#"I also watched Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis bowl and I learnt a lot from them." #p#Malinga missed his side's opening two matches with a sore back, but came back strongly to take the <m4>wickets of Tanmay Mishra</m4>, <m5>Peter Ongondo</m5> and <m6>Shem Ngoche</m6> with successive, full, swinging deliveries, with the latter two having their stumps rearranged. <m7>His hat-trick was spread over two overs - the last ball of his seventh and the first two balls of his eighth.</m7> In all, <m8>four of his six victims were bowled</m8> and <m9>the two others were trapped lbw</m9>. #p#In the 2007 World Cup, Malinga grabbed the headlines with four in a row against South Africa at Guyana. "I rate the performance in South Africa with four wickets in four balls as the best. But I am happy that <m10>I got six wickets today</m10> which was my career best." #p#Malinga stated that he could have played in the second match against Pakistan but did not on the advice of the team physio, Tommy Simsek. "I was sad and also lazy when I was not playing the first two matches. I didn't play because I was not fully recovered." #p#He said that he was happy to perform the way he did in front of the Sri Lankan public. "I didn't have much hopes to play for a long time when I was coming to cricket. My only aim was to contribute as much as I can to the team whenever I play for them. I will give my 100 percent in whatever the game I participate. That makes me happy. #p#"I have played for the national team for the past seven years. A lot of people have said that I would not be able to play for a long time (due to injury concerns). But I am happy to have played for the last seven years." #p#Contemplating his future the 27-year-old fast bowler said, "I don't know how long I could play, but I am happy to contribute to the team whenever I play. I believe I can still play Test cricket after considering my injury concerns. When I feel that I can't do anything for the team, I will happily retire."
14	503784	Sri Lanka v Kenya, Group A, World Cup 2011, Colombo	Malinga's freakery wasted on Kenya	Osman Samiuddin in Colombo	March 1, 2011	An unequal fight. <m1>Lasith Malinga bowled fast and straight</m1>, and that was that. AFP Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: Lasith Malinga Matches: Sri Lanka v Kenya at Colombo (RPS) Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Sri Lanka #p#To begin with some brutal honesty, <m2>Lasith Malinga's hat-trick</m2> and bowling generally were wasted on this encounter. It was watched by a surprisingly large number of people gamely creating an atmosphere and it was, as feats of statistics go, worthy of celebration. But Kenya were such miserably unequal opponents that it was too underwhelming. #p#The press conference afterwards confirmed this. About as much time was spent on what will most likely be an entirely pointless handbag scuffle between two players and Sri Lanka's state TV channel, even though <m3>this was Malinga's second hat-trick</m3>, both taken at World Cups. And even thousands of miles away, four years ago on TV, Malinga's four in four against South Africa in Guyana was felt so much more than this as an act of freakery. Despite losing that game, Malinga rated that spell higher. This game had drifted along so casually, a few didn't realise that <m4>he had taken a hat-trick</m4> immediately, broken as it was over two overs. #p#Malinga is actually so compelling a sight you don't need to take into account any opponent at the other end. Watching him bowl pre-game at some stumps was enough. The double-take at his action has worn off. He doesn't run as much as scurry in. In fact, the angry blonde curls dominating his appearance are more distracting; this scribe, though, was always partial to his cornrows phase. He is at least as cool as Chris Gayle though half his size, so that there could also be something cartoonish about the whole picture. Few really fast bowlers have been this small. #p#He has lately relied on more than just yorkers but there cannot be many around who bowl it with more purpose and greater control than he does: he has them available on tap. Today <m5>his 7.4 overs seemed to consist wholly of yorkers, with a couple of short ones and leg-side wides thrown in</m5>, perhaps out of boredom. There wasn't a huge amount of late swing, more late dip and curve, but he was getting it early. Kenya had no chance, jerking their bats down late and down the wrong line. #p#Later, as he sat looking more like a man who had completed the worst spell of his career and answering questions, he name-checked Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis as influences. Like that duo, he takes wickets in short and sharp clusters. Akram had four international hat-tricks to his name but he was on a hat-trick countless times. Once, against the West Indies in 1990-91, Akram took four Test wickets in five balls and the only ball he didn't take a wicket on, the middle one, was a catch dropped by Imran Khan. If you were to predict one bowler in international cricket today to be a serial hat-trick taker, it would have to be Malinga and if we're lucky they might come on grander occasions than this. #p#He is back in time for Sri Lanka, having missed the first two games with a back injury. That has been and probably will be a recurring theme. He doesn't know how long he'll keep playing for, though it has already been seven years since he weirded out Stephen Fleming and New Zealand. Sri Lanka's attack has variety without him, but with him it becomes a different beast, more teeth and hair. On Saturday, Australia and their fast boys are in town and for one match at least, this World Cup will be all about pace.
15	503724	England v Ireland, Group B, World Cup 2011, Bangalore	Ireland aim to take down the old enemy	Liam Brickhill in Bangalore	March 1, 2011	#p#With their boisterous, fun-loving demeanour both on and off the pitch, Ireland were always going to be one of the Associate teams that, as AB de Villiers said, make the World Cup "more colourful" When captain Will Porterfield arrived for a pre-match press conference ahead of their encounter with England in Bangalore tomorrow, it quickly became apparent that that description could be applied quite literally too, as he took off his cap to reveal a shock of bright purple hair. #p#Porterfield on the difference between England and Ireland "If you look at England, they've got that first-class structure and a very good one at that, and you can produce a lot of cricketers from that. You've got a lot of county systems, the volume of numbers playing the game over there and they've got that natural progression up through the ranks to get up through first-class and onto the international level. "In Ireland, we're at the stage where we're pretty much a club-orientated country and that gap between club cricket and the country is something we've got to get a structure to bridge in terms of producing more international cricketers. I think like everything in sport a lot comes down to funding and you can only do so much if your hands are tied on that front. We're making steps in the right direction and we've just got to get that stage where we're producing more international cricketers." #p#"You're not imagining things," he explained, smiling. "The Irish Cancer Society and Today FM, a radio station back home, they run a 'Shave or Dye' campaign in February. It's just about raising awareness. There's a few interesting lids floating about, five of us dyed and a good few shaved. Boyd Rankin's got his own dyed blue as well, Kevin O'Brien's similar to me own and there's a bit of blonde in there. Anything we can do for the cancer society back home is good, it's for a good cause." #p#It would be wrong, of course, to interpret the team's jovial attitude as a sign that they're not taking this tournament seriously. They are, and having risen to level on points with Zimbabwe in the ICC's one-day rankings, there's no denying their status at the top of the Associate pile. They're at the threshold of full membership, and the team knows full well what slaying a couple of giants in this tournament would do for their case. More immediately, there's also the small matter of getting one over on the 'old enemy' - England. #p#"We need absolutely no motivation when facing the old enemy and I know how desperate everyone in the camp is to atone for what we see as our failure on Friday night," Porterfield wrote in his World Cup Diary on Sunday. "In many ways the game is like a local derby, and we know anything can happen on the day." #p#Shortly after Ireland's mid-morning practice session on a steaming hot day in Bangalore, Porterfield expounded further on what the game means for Ireland: "I think it is [a special occasion]. Any Irish sports team playing an English team is always pretty special for them, and especially to people back home. They always want to see us get one over on the English, so I'm sure there'll be plenty back home watching and hoping for a positive result from the Irish. Anyone can slip up on any particular day, but [England] are playing good cricket and we've just got to be on top of our own game." #p#Ireland are also under added pressure to take down one of the bigger teams after their 27-run loss to Bangladesh in Dhaka last week - a match they could easily have won. "To go through our group we're going to have to win probably three of our next five games, so every game is kind of a must-win from here on in," Porterfield said. "But we can't look too far ahead in terms of the result, we've just got to look at the process of how we get there and what we've got to put right from the last game and how we've got to go about our own game. #p#"The day after the game and that night the lads were pretty gutted. It's no lie, anyone that loses a game like that you're going to be pretty down, but that's professional sport. You've got to pick yourself up from the lows like that. It's no secret our batting let us down, there were a few soft dismissals in there. It's just a matter of being a bit tougher on ourselves. You can't afford to give away free wickets like that. It's just being cricket smart, there's nothing dramatic that has to change." #p#William Porterfield dyed his hair for a good cause AFP Enlarge #p#It may well be the bowlers, rather than the batsmen, who are more anxious ahead of Tuesday's game after watching 676 runs being scored in England's game against India at the same venue. Porterfield insisted he had confidence in Boyd Rankin and George Dockrell, perhaps the two most important members of his attack. #p#"[Rankin] has got all the attributes to be a fantastic bowler. He went for a few in Dhaka. They got a few away and that can happen to anyone on their day. I still think he's one of our main wicket-taking threats. He may go for a few runs but as we've seen in this tournament you've got to take wickets to peg things back and he's one of our main wicket-takers and I'm pretty confident he can bounce back. #p#"[Dockrell] is pretty new to the game. He only came in last year in the Twenty20 World Cup and was dropped in at the deep end in the West Indies. He hadn't had much experience before then, he had one Under-19 World Cup under his belt. He's taken everything in his stride, he's a pretty level-headed young guy. He's just finished school and he's done pretty well there as well. #p#They are utterly different species as bowlers, Dockrell a mantis-limbed left-arm spinner and Rankin a towering 6' 6" fast bowler, but they may well end up sharing the new ball. Spin has been introduced very early by several teams in this tournament, and it appeared Dockrell could be given the responsibility of exploiting Kevin Pietersen's much-discussed weakness against left-arm spin. #p#"Anything is possible, it's definitely an option for us," Porterfield admitted. "He's bowled in the Powerplays for us before, and he's bowled in the first six overs in Twenty20s so that's nothing new to him. He knows how to bowl with the new ball so that's definitely an option as well." #p#While obviously focussing on the present and the immediate challenge of taking on England, a team Ireland have never beaten, Porterfield is also well aware of his team's duty as pioneers of Irish cricket and the important position they occupy in Ireland's cricketing history. #p#"Cricket's been played in Ireland for a very long time now, since 1855 we've been playing cricket as a nation. We want to get to the stage where we become a full member ourselves and get into the Future Tours Programme. We want to get to the stage where lads don't have to make that call [to play for England] or have to move on and play that way. We want to be in a position where we can contract 12 to 15 full-time Irish cricketers. #p#"In an ideal scenario we'd have 15 lads contracted back in Dublin training day in, day out. It's obviously a financial thing, it's a fixtures thing, it's everything, but we're at the stage now where that's where we want to be and everyone's working towards that and hopefully we'll get there."
15	503741	World Cup 2011	Mature Dockrell gears up for bigger tests	Brydon Coverdale	March 1, 2011	George Dockrell: Aiming High Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: George Dockrell Matches: England v Ireland at Bangalore Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Ireland #p#George Dockrell is used to passing important tests. When Australia came to Dublin last June for a one-off one-day international, the then 17-year-old gave up the chance to face Ricky Ponting and his men because he was sitting for a high-school biology exam. #p#"I got a B in that, so it was worth it in the end," Dockrell says. #p#He'll be looking for an A-grade in his next major assignment, and instead of answering questions about living organisms, this one is a practical examination. Can he get inside the minds of England's batsmen at the Chinnaswamy Stadium on Wednesday? #p#In his first year in the Ireland side, Dockrell has already shown so much promise that Somerset have signed him to a two-year deal. And as Eoin Morgan has proved, a foot in the door at the county level can be the first step towards Test cricket for an Irishman. Of course, Dockrell dreams of playing Test cricket for Ireland, but he knows that unless his home country makes rapid progress to becoming a full member of the ICC, England is the only option. #p#Every chance he gets to bowl to the likes of Kevin Pietersen and Andrew Strauss is another important learning curve for Dockrell, a spindly left-arm spinner who at 18 already looks a natural in the limited-overs formats. His first-class journey has only just begun, but his Somerset coach Andy Hurry has been impressed with Dockrell's maturity beyond his years. #p#"He's got real potential to fulfill that goal of Test cricket," Hurry says. "At the moment his strength is definitely one-day cricket, where the batsmen tend to be quite attacking, which helps his game. But he's also very, very resourceful in his understanding of his cricket. He's thoughtful in his slight variations of pace, slight variations in flight, and that is something that he's worked out himself. He keeps trying to work the batsman out." #p#He certainly got inside the heads of a few batsmen in the Caribbean last year when he found himself bowling in the World Twenty20. By the time he had delivered ten balls in the tournament he had two wickets. #p#Dockrell's skiddy style suited the pitches in the West Indies, and he finished with 3 for 16 against the hosts and 0 for 19 against England. Ten months on, Dockrell still swims in the green Ireland jersey, although he has bulked up a fraction. And now he knows he can match it with quality opposition. #p#"I was a 17-year-old then and I wasn't sure how I was going to go, playing against Test nations, playing against England and all those teams," Dockrell says. "That really gave me the confidence that I could put in those performances." #p#Not long afterwards, Somerset came calling. Hurry says they immediately liked what they saw. #p#"We invited him down to have a look at him and he really impressed us for a number of reasons," Hurry says. "The first one really is how intelligent he was, not only as a human being, academically, but also from a cricketing perspective. He's really switched on, very aware of what his strengths are in his bowling. One of the key things that encouraged us to sign him was not only his huge potential, but most importantly his character. #p#"He has vision and drive and motivation to be the best he possibly could, his mental strength and also his ability to learn quickly in other aspects of his game like his batting and fielding, and also his work ethic down in the gym. He's very strong-willed and knows exactly what's required for him to be successful and to get to the next level in county cricket and then hopefully one day to Test cricket." #p#It has taken a strong will for Dockrell to juggle cricket with his studies. That won't change any time soon, with his Ireland and Somerset duties unlikely to stop him from hitting the books again next year. #p#"I'm looking at maybe going to college next year, I'll potentially have a place in science at Trinity College in Dublin," Dockrell says. "You can only play cricket for so long, so I'd like to mix the two of them [cricket and study]." #p#There's something very Daniel Vettori-like about Dockrell. Both began in the junior ranks as fast bowlers. Both switched disciplines and burst on to the international scene as teenage left-arm orthodox spinners. Both have natural cricket brains and a bent for science, although the game got in the way of Vettori's plans to study pharmaceutical sciences at university. #p#And like Vettori, Dockrell is showing a few of his older team-mates how it's done. Ireland's World Cup began with a loss to Bangladesh, although Dockrell played his part to perfection, collecting 2 for 23 from his ten overs, and he will be a key man in their campaign to make the quarter-finals. #p#That task continues on Wednesday, when he'll be cheered on by his father Derek, who will be in the crowd in Bangalore.

After he'd added <m15>a match-changing 162 with Alex Cusack</m15>, <m16>John Mooney joined him to play the innings of his life and help write another famous chapter in Irish sport</m16>. #p#When <m17>the partnership</m17> was broken with 55 still needed Ireland could have lost their way, especially when O'Brien couldn't get the strike back. However, after struggling to get the ball away <m18>Mooney suddenly started locating the boundary</m18>, <m19>firstly off the outside edge</m19> but then with <m20>two nerveless drives through the covers</m20>, each coming after England had strung together a few dot balls to build pressure. <m21>He was the dominant partner in the seven-wicket stand</m21>. #p#Still, though, there was a final twist when <m22>O'Brien was run out in the penultimate over</m22>. <m23>Trent Johnston, however, drove his first ball, a full toss from Stuart Broad, for four as the equation came down to below a run-a-ball for the first time in the entire chase.</m23> <m24>The final over started with just three needed</m24> and <m25>off the second ball Mooney clipped Anderson through midwicket to set off epic celebrations</m25> that will take over any available Bangalore bar tonight. #p#O'Brien's innings was breathtaking. He entered when <m26>Ed Joyce, seemingly Ireland's last chance of making the chase a contest, was stumped off Graeme Swann</m26> to leave their run-chase floundering at <m27>106 for 4</m27>, which soon became <m28>111 for 5</m28> when <m29>Gary Wilson fell lbw</m29>. But O'Brien proceeded to tear the England attack apart. He showed power reminiscent of Kieron Pollard but with a calmer head and better technique, bringing up <m30>his hundred off 50 balls with a tuck for two into the leg side</m30> to beat Matthew Hayden's World Cup record of 66 deliveries. It led to a reveal of his the purple head-do as part of Ireland's charity fundraising campaign. #p#He showed his intent early when <m31>he thumped Swann through the covers second-ball</m31> and then <m32>tucked into the offspinner's ninth over with two sixes over midwicket</m32> which injected life into Ireland's innings. <m33>O'Brien was on 35 off 22 balls</m33> when Ireland took <m34>the batting Powerplay</m34> and it was during those five overs that the chance of the impossible became possible as 62 runs surged onto the total. #p#As happened against Ryan ten Doeschate's onslaught in their opening match against the Netherlands, England's bowlers started to lose the plot during another wayward, undisciplined display. <m35>Michael Yardy went for 16</m35> <m36>as did James Anderson whom O'Brien pulled for a huge six</m36> to take him to <m37>a 30-ball fifty</m37>. <m38>Anderson's next over went for 17</m38> including <m39>another leg-side pull</m39> and in between whiles, <m40>even the normally reliable Tim Bresnan was dispatched, including the finest shot of O'Brien's innings when he drove a six clean over cover</m40>. #p#Really, though, fielding restrictions meant nothing to O'Brien and he continued on his merry way with <m41>another huge blow over midwicket to take him into the 90s</m41>. Then the whole of Ireland held their breath as <m42>O'Brien's next attempt to clear the rope sent the ball high into the night sky where Andrew Strauss made a lot of ground but then couldn't hold on.</m42> #p#O'Brien needed support to play his incredible innings and Cusack's role can't be understated in the amazing scenes which unfolded. He was almost lost in O'Brien's slipstream but sensibly rotated the strike until, <m43>off his 49th ball, he joined the boundary hitting by launching Collingwood over midwicket then thumped Yardy straight down the ground.</m43> <m44>Even his dismissal, run-out from backward point, was for the team cause</m44> as he ensured O'Brien stayed at the crease. Although he wasn't quite there at the end he had written himself a permanent place in Irish folklore. #p#Even more incredibly this wasn't a run chase built on solid foundations. <m45>William Porterfield dragged the first ball of the innings into his stumps</m45> and although Paul Stirling, Ed Joyce and Niall O'Brien all played neatly their contributions were seemingly too insignificant in such a huge pursuit. In the final outcome, however, the intent shown by Stirling, in particular, showed Ireland wouldn't take a backward step. #p#Tellingly, too, <m46>Stirling was given a life when Matt Prior shelled a simple chance which set the tone for another shoddy fielding display</m46>. However, it looked like England would comfortably emerge unscathed when <m47>Swann removed three middle-order scalps with a teasing spell of drift, flight and turn</m47> to leave <m48>Ireland 111 for 5</m48>. Already, though, O'Brien was at the non-striker's end and about embark on one of the great match-winning displays. #p#There are so many areas England will rue, chiefly another below-par display in the field but they will also look back on the closing stages of <m49>their seemingly impressive 327</m49>. <m50>The final five overs only brought 33 runs</m50> as <m51>Mooney preceded his crucial batting effort with some smart death bowling and a career-best 4 for 63</m51>. It meant, like for India three days ago, the 350-plus that was on the cards when <m52>Jonathan Trott and Ian Bell were adding 167 for the third wicket</m52> didn't materialise. This tournament is proving that big first-innings scores are no certainty of victory. #p#It will be largely forgotten because of what followed, but Trott wrote his own place in the record books when he reached 1000 runs in his 21st innings to equal the mark set by Viv Richards and Kevin Pietersen. <m53>The latter had set up the innings with a sparkling 59 before throwing away his chance of a hundred with a top-edged reverse sweep.</m53> It wasn't England's only piece of lazy cricket. <m54>Bell's was a lovely, easy, innings as he moved along with smart placement and deft touches to tick off his fifty from 61 balls.</m54> #p#After their problems against India, England actually used <m55>the batting Powerplay</m55> reasonably well to collect 45 runs and even though the middle order failed to fire once again it appeared fairly insignificant when Ireland's top order was whittled away. One man, though, stood in their way and the rest, as they say, is history. #p#Match Timeline
15	503918	England v Ireland, World Cup 2011, Group B, Bangalore	Easy as spit for O'Brien	Liam Brickhill in Bangalore	March 2, 2011	<m1>Ireland produced one of the most famous upsets of all time</m1>. Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: Alex Cusack | John Mooney | Kevin O'Brien | Jonathan Trott Matches: England v Ireland at Bangalore Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: England | Ireland #p#Injury scare of the day. <m2>His team-mates must have feared the worst when Kevin O'Brien stooped to field the ball after stopping a drive in the covers and, his left knee buckling underneath him, he fell to the ground, writhing in agony. O'Brien's booted foot had slipped on the grass, his knee wobbling and then clicking backwards in a stomach-churning movement that drew gasps of horror when it was replayed on the big screen. But after a tense couple of minutes and the attention of the team physio he was back up again - albeit with a little discomfort - and stayed on the field thereafter.</m2> And it didn't seem to affect his batting either... #p#Blasé pose of the day. 'If Sachin can do it, why can't I?' <m3>Kevin O'Brien may well have thought before heaving Graeme Swann over wide long-on for his second six in three balls to complete the 27th over.</m3> As the ball sailed over the rope O'Brien stepped away from the crease and stood left foot over right, leaning on the bat with his left hand and his right propped nonchalantly on his hip, and spat. It was a pose he repeated after each of <m4>his 19 boundaries in a 63-ball 113</m4> that set up <m5>the most famous victory</m5> in Irish cricketing history. #p#Missed opportunity of the day. Kevin Pietersen's one-day century drought stretches all the way back to November 2008, but in conditions tailor-made for batting in Bangalore it looked as though the platform was set for him to break that lengthy run. <m6>He motored past fifty - his first as an England opener - against a relatively tame bowling attack on the flattest of tracks</m6>, and a ton looked like merely a matter of staying at the crease. <m7>But then came the brainfreeze as, to the third ball he faced from part-time offspinner Paul Stirling, he played the cutest, and most unnecessary, of reverse dabs to present wicketkeeper Niall O'Brien with the simplest of catches.</m7> The wait continues... #p#Dropped catch of the day. 'Which one?' you might reasonably ask. The damage had already pretty much been done when <m8>Gary Wilson spilled a chance at deep midwicket in the 49th over of England's innings</m8> but that was at least the only chance Ireland missed in the field all afternoon. England, whose fielding let Netherlands off the hook innumerable times in Nagpur, seemed to drop their guard against the similarly unfancied Irish and <m9>let no less than six chances go begging</m9> - <m10>the most costly being Andrew Strauss's valiant, but unsuccessful, effort off a Kevin O'Brien skier when the batsman had scored 91</m10>. #p#Unlikely milestone of the day. Perhaps it is the distraction of his absorbed, almost obsessive-compulsive manner at the crease, perhaps the machine-like efficiency of his batting that leaves no room for either flaw or flair, but for some reason Jonathan Trott's equalling of the record for the fastest batsman to 1,000 one-day runs - in just his 21st innings - seems an unlikely milestone for a batsmen initially thought to score too slowly to fit into England's limited-overs side. And yet <m11>with a deep-set whip to leg for two in the 37th over</m11> - could it have come any other way? - he drew level with the likes of Viv Richards and team-mate Kevin Pietersen.
15	503922	England v Ireland, World Cup 2011, Group B, Bangalore	Boundaries do it for Ireland	S Rajesh	March 2, 2011	Ireland managed to score at least ten in an over nine times in their last 25 overs. ESPNcricinfo Ltd Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: John Mooney | Kevin O'Brien Matches: England v Ireland at Bangalore Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: England | Ireland #p#When <m1>Ireland had slumped to 113 for 5</m1> for 25, the overwhelming feeling was one of resignation, as another lesser team seemed to be going down without much of a fight. At the same stage of their innings, England had scored 31 more runs, and lost three fewer wickets. Ireland's asking rate at that stage was 8.60, and they needed to sustain that rate over 25 overs, with only the bottom five wickets at their disposal. Impossible? Most would have thought so, but obviously Kevin O'Brien and Co didn't. #p#What transpired in the last 25 was truly incredible, as Ireland scored at a run rate of 8.93, and <m2>lost only two wickets</m2> while doing so, in the process achieving the highest successful run-chase in World Cup history. In <m3>the batting Powerplay</m3>, Ireland scored 62 without losing a wicket, which is the second-highest score in batting Powerplays in this World Cup, next to Pakistan's 70 for 1 in their one-sided match against Kenya. #p#<m4>Kevin O'Brien blasted the fastest World Cup century</m4>, and he didn't just edge past the earlier record; he utterly demolished it, bettering Matthew Hayden's mark by 16 deliveries. In fact, only five batsmen have scored a quicker century in the entire history of one-day internationals. #p#Overall, the contrast between the manner in which the two teams batted couldn't have been greater. England preferred to accumulate steadily (if such a term can be used for <m5>a total of 327</m5>). <m6>They scored only 134 runs in boundaries</m6>, and instead <m7>ran plenty of singles (131)</m7> and <m8>played very few dot balls (119)</m8>. #p#Ireland's method was the complete opposite: <m9>they ran 47 fewer singles</m9>, and <m10>played out 37 more dot balls</m10>. In a normal game, a difference of that magnitude in doing the basics would have proved decisive. <m11>O'Brien, though, had the skill and the power to strike boundaries at will</m11>, and that made up for all the other flaws in the run-chase. Ireland scored 52 more runs in boundaries than England - an unusually large difference in such a close game - and that, ultimately, was the more important statistic than dot balls and singles. #p#How Ireland made the chase Score Dot balls Singles 2s/ 3s 4s/ 6s England - First 25 overs 144 for 2 74 49 11/ 1 12/ 3 Ireland - First 25 overs 113 for 5 94 40 3/ 0 11/ 2 England - Last 25 overs 183 for 6 45 82 7/ 0 14/ 2 Ireland - Last 25 overs 216 for 2 62 44 10/ 0 22/ 7 England - 50 overs 327 for 8 119 131 18/ 1 26/ 5 Ireland - 49.1 overs 329 for 7 156 84 13/ 0 33/ 9 #p#<m12>Ireland's 329</m12> is also the highest total by a non-Test-playing team against a Test-playing side. Kenya scored 347 for 3 against Bangladesh in Nairobi, but that was in 1997, before Bangladesh made their Test debut. O'Brien was obviously the hero, but he got excellent support from Alex Cusack and John Mooney, who earlier became the first Irish bowler to take four wickets in a World Cup match. Despite that, Ireland conceded more than 300 for the first time in World Cups, but that only gave O'Brien an opportunity to show his class. The match total of 656 is the third-highest in World Cup history, only 20 short of the record. #p#For England, there is plenty to worry about before their next game, against South Africa. They have been at the receiving end of two of the largest totals made by Associates in ODIs: a little more than a week back, they conceded 292 against Netherlands. Between these two matches, England also conceded 338 against India, which means they've gone for a grand total of 959 runs in three matches, despite having played only one of the top teams in their group. Their total runs conceded is easily the highest among all the teams in this World Cup, while their economy rate (if it can be called that) of 6.43 is marginally worse than India's 6.21.

Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Audio/Video: O'Briens delighted | William Porterfield: <m2>Biggest victory for Irish cricket</m2>. Players/Officials: Alex Cusack | John Mooney | Kevin O'Brien Matches: England v Ireland at Bangalore Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: England | Ireland #p#On Wednesday night in Bangalore, an Irish legend was born. <m3>For 123 glorious minutes Kevin O'Brien burned more brightly than the floodlights</m3> that illuminated the stadium, as an increasingly impassioned crowd cheered each thundering crack off his bat with ever greater fervour. <m4>Ireland were floundering at a rudderless 106 for 4 in the 23rd over when he entered the fray</m4>, they were at the brink of <m5>the most famous victory in their cricketing history</m5> <m6>when he departed 211 runs later</m6>. The crowd rose as one to cheer him off and tearful pride was writ large on the faces of his parents, who had watched every ball from the stands. #p#"I'm still speechless to be honest," O'Brien said after his breathtaking innings. "There's two proud people up there in the stands, and there's probably 4 million proud people back home. It's a fantastic day, not just for Irish cricket but for any Irish sport. Any time Ireland beat England, it's massive. All I can say is that it's a tremendous day and we're all very proud. It's going to be a good night and we'll celebrate as long and as loudly as we can. #p#"That's a long way the best innings I've ever played," he added. "It even eclipses playing in the back garden with Niall, where hitting out of the garden was out. I think anyone is going to struggle to beat that innings to be honest, and I'll take a few fines for that. I'll say that all night, <m7>a hundred off fifty balls in a World Cup in front of a billion people under lights against England</m7>, it doesn't get any better." #p#It was fitting that O'Brien became Ireland's leading run-scorer in one-day cricket in the course of his innings. <m8>His record-breaking century</m8> - the fastest in World Cup history - sealed the biggest chase the tournament has ever seen, smashing a record that had stood for 19 years, and helped <m9>Ireland soar to their first ever win over England</m9>. William Porterfield, Ireland's captain and the man O'Brien eclipsed on that run-scoring list, was effusive in his praise for what he called "an unbelievable knock" #p#"There's not many games where a team will be <m10>111 for 5</m10> with 24 overs gone and chase 320-odd and knock them off with a few balls to spare," said Porterfield. "It's an unbelievable knock, it's the best knock I've seen. It's got to rank as one of the best, if not the best, World Cup knock." #p#Porterfield was equally enthused about the team's victory and its place in Irish cricketing history, adding: "I think it's <m11>the biggest win that Irish cricket's ever had.</m11> Obviously there's the win against Pakistan [in 2007] that put us through the group but in terms of a one-off win it's the biggest we've ever had, and one of the best. <m12>It's the biggest chase in World Cup history and it's the biggest chase we've had in a long time. It's the best win in Irish cricket's history for me</m12>." #p#While Ireland had managed to just about keep afloat after the disaster of <m13>losing Porterfield to the first ball of the innings</m13>, their pursuit of 328 had been drifting into mediocrity before <m14>O'Brien strode to the crease</m14>. <m15>He reached the boundary three times within the first 10 deliveries he faced</m15>, displaying remarkable self-belief, and never looked back. #p#"I Just went out and tried to be positive," he said. "Just back my own ability and if the ball's there to hit, try and hit it, and hit it as hard as I can. It was obviously a tricky situation, it didn't help <m16>losing the fifth wicket for 111</m16>. We were backs-against-the-wall but we took a chance and we got the ball rolling and from there I don't think England had any answers for us. They didn't really know what they were up to with their bowling plans and we took advantage of that." #p#William Porterfield: "There's not many games where a team will be <m17>111 for 5 with 24 overs gone</m17> and chase 320-odd and knock them off with a few balls to spare." Getty Images Enlarge #p#Porterfield suggested the turning point came when <m18>the Batting Powerplay was taken after the 31st over.</m18> <m19>The 32nd, bowled by Michael Yardy, was the most expensive of the innings until that point</m19>, but there was even more carnage to come. <m20>Three overs later O'Brien crashed James Anderson into the night sky and high over the midwicket boundary with scarcely believable force to smash another record, for the biggest six of the tournament, with a 102-metre behemoth.</m20> <m21>Five overs of fielding restrictions yielded 62 runs</m21> and with 99 needed at seven-an-over, for the first time the finish line became visible for Ireland. #p#"It was the turning point," said Porterfield. "We've obviously got plans and strategies before the game, but it's up to the lads in the middle to make that call [on taking the Powerplay]. They know how they feel out there and what they feel they can do, so I think it was a pretty good decision to take it then." #p#It was soon after that O'Brien truly began to believe that he could do more than simply bruise English egos, and that victory was actually achievable. "For me, it was probably at about 12 overs to go. We needed 80 or 90 off 12, about seven an over and the wicket out there was extremely flat, the ball was coming onto the bat nicely and it's a pretty small ground with a quick outfield. You pierce the ball through the infield and it's either two or four, and it helped that I was hitting the ball pretty cleanly as well." #p#There was a final twist to the tale, however, and <m22>when O'Brien was run out in the 49th over with 11 still needed</m22> one might have expected there to be some fluttering hearts in the Ireland camp. But O'Brien insisted that, even then, they felt victory was theirs for the taking. #p#"I knew John-boy [John Mooney] was there and he was hitting the ball extremely cleanly, and then <m23>Trent [Johnston] too come in</m23>. Trent's no tailender, he hits a big ball and he's a fantastic player coming in at No. 8 or 9 for us. I just knew if we didn't panic it was down to a run a ball, and they weren't really hitting their straps. They weren't hitting their yorkers and they were always giving us a four-ball - one an over - so we knew if we just sat on it, kept out the good ball and hit the bad ball that we'd <m24>walk to victory</m24>." #p#<m25>The win, with five balls to spare, was indeed ultimately a stroll</m25>, but Ireland's reaction was anything but. The Ireland changing room had bristled with increasingly nervous, fidgety energy until <m26>the explosion of emotion that came with Mooney's swat to the midwicket boundary, the players spilling onto the field in joyful delirium.</m26> #p#Ireland's cricketers, with an assortment of shaved, blond, blue and purple heads, brought colour and excitement to match England's epic against India at the same venue last week. O'Brien stood out more than most with his garish pink and blond mop, and <m27>his match-winning century</m27> will stand out in similar technicolor in the memories of all who saw it on a legendary night in Bangalore.

It was almost as though they'd been waiting to exhale for the longest time - for 20-odd overs, when the unthinkable first appeared within reach once Kevin O'Brien began his battering. <m2>As John Mooney finally despatched Jimmy Anderson to the recesses beyond the midwicket boundary</m2>, the hundreds gathered at the ground let go all at once. #p#As the Ireland team celebrated mid-pitch in a raw burst of emotions, so did their fans, who had not given up when <m3>Ireland were 111 for 5</m3>. They had dared to dream along with O'Brien, they had willed Mooney on, and finally, they had believed in Trent Johnston. Their reward was what one delirious fan called "<m4>the biggest sporting achievement in the history of Ireland</m4>." How special was it? "Come on, this one's against the English!" #p#In the crazed moments after <m5>the historic win</m5>, standard reporting practice went out of the window. There was no point in asking for names or back stories; the fans, fuelled by whatever was available inside the ground, were in seventh heaven, unable to comprehend the manner and magnitude of the achievement. #p#"It doesn't matter if we get beaten by everyone else in this World Cup. What matters is that we have beaten the English," one fan said. #p#<m6>Wednesday's win</m6> came in the backdrop of the ICC reaffirming its decision to cut the next World Cup down to ten teams and, though it's been a sore point with Ireland and other Associate nations, it didn't seem to matter a jot today. "We don't want to play Tests. We don't want to do anything. The World Cup is over for us. This is it," shouted a tall, Boyd Rankin lookalike. #p#Some supporters had almost given up after seeing Ireland stutter early in their mammoth chase but they decided to wait as long as Kevin O'Brien was batting. "We had decided that we'd leave if Kevin O'Brien got out. But he didn't. Oh, he just didn't get out. He just kept going on and on. It's a massive innings. It's just fantastic," said Rankin-lookalike's companion. #p#Keeping them company was a smattering of locals, who were cheering for the underdog and were soon turned into believers. Suddenly, what was a leisurely outing with the family turned into fierce rooting for the Irish. Singles were loudly cheered, boundaries drowned in the cacophony - as much as a few thousand could muster - usually reserved for Virender Sehwag and Sachin Tendulkar. When a close second run was attempted, there were frantic cries of " beda, beda " ("don't" in Kannada). <m7>Alex Cusack's run-out drew groans</m7>, <m8>the eerie silence that accompanied O'Brien's was deafening</m8>. #p#The pre-match prediction was that it would all end in tears. It did - but tears of joy when <m9>the winning boundary was hit</m9> and more of them when an emotional O'Brien accepted his Man-of-the-Match award. Soon they dispersed into the night, and as they made their way out of Chinnaswamy Stadium and into the depths of Cubbon Park, they thanked the Indians among the crowd for their support. #p#But they did so with one caveat. An elderly Irishman, his eyes glistening with pride, said it all. "The Indian fans are good and friendly. But after today, watch out India. You are next." The Green Army marches on.

Players/Officials: Kevin O'Brien Matches: England v Ireland at Bangalore Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Ireland #p#Just how do you begin to make sense of what happened under lights at the Chinnaswamy Stadium on Wednesday? The cricket World Cup has seen upsets before. Zimbabwe beat Australia in 1983, and Ireland first came to prominence with that thrilling triumph over Pakistan in 2007. But Australia in 83 were a team in decline and the Pakistanis were a shambles. England, as they showed on Sunday night against India, are an upwardly mobile force. #p#You can look to other sports and still not find an answer. Argentina lost to Cameroon in the opening game of Italia 90, while the French slipped on a banana skin against Senegal 12 years later. But the French, with Zinedine Zidane injured, had played one tournament too many as a group, while the Argentines had always been mercurial and prone to implosion. #p#Comparisons with Ireland's Italia 90 adventure aren't accurate either. They may have been unfancied quarter-finalists but the man who scored against England, Kevin Sheedy, was a household name, a legend of the great Everton sides of the 1980s. Rugby comparisons fail too, because Brian O'Driscoll, who led them to a first Grand Slam in 61 years in 2010, has long been recognised as one of the game's greats. #p#So, where do we slot Kevin O'Brien and this innings for the ages? The only comparison that makes sense to me is with another team that played in green 42 years ago. The New York Jets were huge underdogs going into Super Bowl III against Johnny Unitas and the Baltimore Colts, but Joe Namath played the game of his life to upset the odds. #p#The Jets were part of the much-derided American Football League, the new kids on the block. Against the might of the National Football League, they weren't given a chance. Their win paved the way for parity, for a level playing field. #p#The O'Brien family has some previous when it comes to such heroics. Let's not forget that it was Niall's classy 72 that provided the ballast for the tricky run-chase against Pakistan. A game earlier , Kevin's sturdy medium-pace produced a wicket-maiden when Zimbabwe needed just nine to win from 12 balls. They would only tie. #p#How wonderful it would be if this triumph could do for Irish cricket what the Jets did for the AFL. Ireland have proudly carried the Associates' standard for two World Cups in succession. They're not asking for free lunches, just for a fair chance. #p#"The ICC have made the decision to reduce it [the next World Cup] to 10 teams and that's pretty disappointing," said William Porterfield afterwards, managing to look serious even with purple hair. "We will have to wait and see what happens in April when they decide if there will be a qualifying tournament. If we don't get in, it could be the death knell for Associate teams." #p#As special as Ireland's three results in 2007 were, this easily eclipses them. Zimbabwe were there for the taking, while Pakistan scripted their demise with shots of staggering stupidity. Bangladesh just couldn't cope with a fast and bouncy pitch in Barbados #p#The elitists' argument has as many legs as Long John Silver did. A cosy clique works for those within, but it alienates everyone else, and destroys their chances of development. Sri Lanka won just two of their first 15 World Cup matches. Had the ICC lost patience after they lost every game in 1987, there would have been no Cinderella story in 1996. #p#Of course, Sri Lanka had a thriving school system to produce talent, and fine coaches. The likes of Ireland and Netherlands don't, yet, and they never will if young kids are denied the chance to dream of being the next O'Brien or ten Doeschate on the world stage. #p#This was my 25th World Cup game, and half a dozen of them have featured Ireland. No one who was there will ever forget St Patrick's Day in 2007, "Cotton Eye Joe" blaring from the speakers and throats increasingly lubricated by Red Stripe, singing "The Fields of Athenry" and "Molly Malone" Those were "I- was there" moments I'll treasure all my life, and the World Cup would be immeasurably poorer without them. #p#Having watched Ireland play and also in training, and talked to the likes of Trent Johnston and Boyd Rankin, it's not hard to guess why they so consistently punch above their weight. If you could bottle the spirit within the camp, it would sell as well as Guinness or Bushmills. They're a tight unit, and take such joy in each other's successes. Against a team of prima donnas or those that feel success is their entitlement, they will always have a chance. #p#As special as the three results in 2007 were, this easily eclipses them. Zimbabwe were there for the taking, while Pakistan scripted their demise with shots of staggering stupidity. Bangladesh just couldn't cope with a fast and bouncy pitch in Barbados. #p#<m3>Here, England made 327</m3>. Against Bangladesh in Mirpur, Ireland had needed just 55 from 81 balls with five wickets in hand when O'Brien Junior was dismissed. They fell apart. Here, <m4>Alex Cusack was run out when 55 were required with just 51 balls remaining</m4>. This time, there was no disintegration. #p#The previous highest World Cup score by a "minnow" batting second was Sri Lanka's 276 for 4 in the inaugural World Cup. That day at The Oval, Australia had made one more than England did at the Chinnaswamy. When <m5>the Powerplay</m5> was taken, Ireland needed 161 from 114 balls. Associate teams just don't do that against full-strength opposition. Neither do batsmen who play in the Leinster League after county contracts have been terminated make 50-ball centuries on the biggest stage. #p#Till now. This is the wake-up call that cricket needs. Embrace, don't alienate. Nurture, don't destroy. Take the Ghanas out of the football and the Irelands out of the cricket, and what we're left with would be a much poorer spectacle.
15	503935	England v Ireland, World Cup 2011, Group B, Bangalore	Strauss stunned by England humiliation	Liam Brickhill in Bangalore	March 2, 2011	#p#England captain Andrew Strauss admitted to being shocked and disappointed at <m1>his side's three-wicket defeat to Ireland in Bangalore</m1>, as <m2>Kevin O'Brien's record-breaking hundred</m2> highlighted lapses in the field and a worrying lack of penetration with the ball. Strauss backed his side to bounce back from the loss, however, and insisted "we're not out of the World Cup by any means" #p#"It was a bit of a shock for us if I'm honest, and bitterly disappointing because we did a lot of things badly in the field again," said Strauss. "We could have taken our catches. <m3>I dropped him</m3> and <m4>we dropped three other catches as well</m4>, which in the end cost us the game, there's no doubt about it. #p#"Our bowling could've been better, certainly in <m5>the Powerplay</m5>," Strauss added. "I think we got a bit taken by surprise there. And we just can't afford to give away that many chances on these sorts of wickets. It's very hard to get people out on very flat wickets, and if you're <m6>dropping four of them</m6> then you're asking for trouble." #p#England appeared to be cruising to victory after Kevin Pietersen, Jonathan Trott and Ian Bell all fired with the bat to boost their side to <m7>327 for 8</m7>, and the bowlers followed that up by <m8>dismissing half of Ireland's line-up with just over 100 runs on the board</m8>. Then came O'Brien's no-holds-barred innings, which utterly changed the complexion of the match the longer it went on. #p#"I thought we were in a great position to win the game, absolutely," said Strauss. "We knew they had some dangerous hitters in the back end of their batting order but with the rate climbing as much as it was, it seemed that if we just kept very patient then wickets would fall, but O'Brien had other ideas. It was an outstanding innings. Just the gall he showed to take the game to us in that situation. They took <m9>the Powerplay</m9> and [he] struck the ball beautifully. He rescued them from a perilous position to one where they were up with the rate and just had to keep their heads at the end." #p#England were bewildered by their shortcomings in Bangalore. Getty Images Enlarge #p#The inability of his bowlers to stem the flow of runs towards the end of the innings will be a particular worry for Strauss and 62 runs came from <m10>the batting Powerplay</m10>, effectively bringing Ireland back into the game. Strauss pointed out that bowlers on both sides had struggled, and would continue to do so on wickets tailored to suit batsmen. #p#"The wickets here have been very, very flat wickets. We've easily got 300 in two of the three games and chased 290 in the other, so the bowlers have got to expect to go for the odd run here and there. But what we don't want to be doing is haemorrhaging runs on both sides of the wicket and chasing our tail too much, which potentially we have done in those last three games, and we're going to have to improve. #p#"It's hard work, certainly the two wickets we've played on here haven't suited any one particular bowler. All bowlers have suffered at the hands of the wicket. But it's still a game of cricket, you've got to get more runs than the opposition team. You've got to handle those conditions better than the opposition team, and if you don't you're going to lose the game." #p#England remain second in their group, with three points, despite the defeat, but Group B has been thrown wide open and their next game, against South Africa on Sunday in Chennai, is sure to provide a stiff challenge. #p#"The game coming up against South Africa is a huge one for us. Generally we've bounced back from defeat well in the past, whether it's in Test cricket or one-day cricket. We're going to have to do that very quickly and probably be honest with each other and realise where we can improve and make those improvements very quickly. Hopefully it'll galvanise us as a team. The equation is pretty simple now: we can't afford any slip-ups and we're going to have to go out there and deliver."
15	503937	England v Ireland, Group B, World Cup 2011, Bangalore	Partying supporters send message to ICC	Siddarth Ravindran	March 2, 2011	#p#A beaming Cricket Ireland president, Basil McNamee, was among the dozens of delighted Irish fans awaiting their heroes at the team hotel in Bangalore on Wednesday night, savouring "<m1>the best victory in Ireland's cricket history</m1>" <m2>The stunning upset of England</m2>, their fiercest sporting rival, not only threw Group B wide open and injected excitement into a long-drawn league phase that was expected to be boringly predictable, but also brought into focus the ICC's decision to shut out Associate nations from the 2015 World Cup. #p#"This win is just a dream come true," McNamee told ESPNcricinfo. "It also sends out a message that Associates can't be taken for granted by everybody, that we can surprise." <m3>Ireland's back-from-the-dead victory</m3> gives them a real chance of making it to the quarter-finals, with two wins from their remaining four matches likely to ensure their qualification. #p#Ireland's position was bleak after defeat in the opening game to Bangladesh, and <m4>sliding to 111 for 5 against England</m4>. The resilience they showed in constructing the largest ever World Cup chase particularly pleased McNamee. "We were used to being defeated. So <m5>when victory comes, a victory against England</m5>, it's absolutely wonderful," he said. "Not only that, our boys played so well. It looked several times that we were going to be second-best again but our boys dug in." #p#The travelling Ireland supporters had plenty of anxious moments in the tense chase, <m6>relief and joy finally taking over when John Mooney clipped a boundary to midwicket off the first ball of the final over</m6>. It was nearly two hours later that the Ireland team arrived at the hotel to a rousing reception from the already partying fans. #p#William Porterfield and the rest of the side soaked in the applause and cheers from the fans who turned the lobby into a sea of green and white. "It was great to see so many of our supporters out here," a composed Porterfield told ESPNcricinfo. "It was even better to give them something to cheer about." #p#Ireland broke a slew of records and charted new ground in their win - <m7>fastest World Cup century for Kevin O'Brien</m7> , biggest World Cup chase, and <m8>their first victory over England</m8> being the prominent ones - and Porterfield said the team hadn't yet realised the enormity of the achievement. "We got to let this sink in still," he said. "We've all grown up dreaming of moments like this in a World Cup, and we're going to enjoy this time with our family and friends and have a couple of drinks." #p#It was the end of a day that he said "definitely eclipsed any Irish cricket has had" but even then he was not distracted from the task ahead for Ireland. "We've got another four games left in the group, and hopefully we can give our fans something more to cheer about," he said. "We've got to back this up in our next few performances and hopefully qualify for the next stage."
15	503940	England v Ireland, Group B, World Cup 2011, Bangalore	Bangalore turns green after night of Ireland's lives	Sriram Veera in Bangalore	March 2, 2011	Ireland's jubilant wives and girlfriends join the celebrations in Bangalore. ESPNcricinfo Ltd Enlarge Related Links Audio/Video: O'Briens delighted. Players/Officials: Kevin O'Brien Matches: England v Ireland at Bangalore Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Ireland #p#A short while after <m1>he hit the fastest ton in World Cup history</m1>, Kevin O'Brien texted his girlfriend Ruth Anne Kilty: "Where are you?" She was on her way to the team hotel. He was in the dressing room. It was their biggest night. As they say in Ireland, it was the night to get scuttered, to get stocious, to get drunk in delirious joy. In the hotel, Ruth couldn't wait to see her boyfriend. "I am an emotional wreck," she says with a big smile. "Kevin too is in a bit of shock." #p#It's her first overseas tour with Kevin. She has seen him play in Ireland but never outside. "He is a very laidback person off the field. He doesn't get stressed. He gets nervous before a game but not stressed. As he says, "Why do you need to get stressed when you are well prepared?" #p#Around her in the hotel lobby, there are Irish fans, in a state of delirium. Some don't even know the names of most players. Cricket is not a big sport back in Ireland. They are world travellers who landed up at the stadium because it was a game against England. Any sport against England was not to be missed. Any win against the old enemy was to be savoured. #p#"Kevin for Prime minister," they shout. "This is massive. We are good at sports like Rugby - The rugby grand slam and the European Cup victories are our biggest sporting achievement - but <m2>this win</m2> is sweeter because it has come in a sport where we are not traditionally strong. We are glad we travelled here to catch this great moment." #p#So is the charming Vanessa, Trent Johnston's wife puts <m3>the victory</m3> in perspective. "The win against Pakistan in the last World Cup was good but at the end of the day Pakistan played badly and we capitalised, whereas today to chase that score was just phenomenal. It was a world-class performance at a time when they are thinking of reducing the teams to 10 and keep out the Associates. For Trent, tonight was special as he became the first Irish bowler to get fifty wickets. He is 36, coming to end of his career, and he is Australian-born; so to beat the Poms means a bit more for him." #p#Vanessa is waiting for her husband to return so that they can speak to their 10-year old daughter Claudia and the seven-year old son Charlie. Vanessa says she has played a bit of cricket and adds, "I taught Trent everything that he knows in cricket! I want that on record, Cricinfo!" She and Ruth throw their heads back as they laugh. An IPL contract might not be far off for Kevin and the world might be at his feet now but he has to wait for one thing. "Surely now, after this great night, either Kevin or you will propose?!" Ruth turns coy, takes a step or two back, shakes her head, laughs and says, "No, no. Absolutely not." #p#Meanwhile, a Bollywood number "de dana dan" is belting out from the hotel speakers. Vanessa does a little jig as she spots a friend. Around 50 fans stream into the lobby. The England bus rolls in exactly at midnight. Andrew Strauss whispers something into the ears of Mushtaq Ahmed and smiles. Paul Collingwood, Graeme Swann, and Matt Prior are even sporting enough to sign a few autographs before they too troop past the fans and disappear into the elevator. #p#Twenty minutes later the Irish bus glides in, triggering huge cheers and cat whistles. The player's faces are priceless. Pride and exhilaration collide in glee. The eyes search for the loved ones, who are standing just beyond a glassed panel, in the inner part of the hotel. Phil Simmons, the coach, Porterfield and of course Kevin are first showered by arc lights and are roped to do interviews. Kevin is the last one to get in; a private moment of celebration ensues. #p#Soon, a small party starts behind closed doors at a banquet hall. Now and then, the door opens and you could hear songs and lot of laughter. Soon, the players, their wives and the fans, who have been invited, dance. #p#Foot-stomping. Beer Guzzling. Laughter. The Cinderellas of World Cricket might have been expected to return to sackcloth after midnight, but the party has only just begun.
15	504008	England v Ireland, World Cup 2011, Group B, Bangalore	England's destiny slipping through their grasp	Andrew Miller	March 3, 2011	England run out of ideas in the wake of an Irish backlash. Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Report : O'Brien blazes Ireland to glory. News : Partying supporters send message to ICC. News : Strauss stunned by England humiliation. Matches: England v Ireland at Bangalore Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: England #p#It's been said with increasing certainty over the past 11 days of action that "The World Cup has finally come alive" It first came alive when Virender Sehwag slammed 175 against Bangladesh on the opening night; it then came alive when Bangladesh bounced back from that defeat to beat Ireland and ignite jubilant scenes in Dhaka; in between those games, it came alive when Ryan ten Doeschate gave England the fright of their lives in Nagpur, and it was most certainly alive when England responded by giving India an almighty tussle in Bangalore. #p#But none of those moments came close to matching the extraordinary liveliness of <m1>Ireland's triumph over England on Wednesday night</m1>. In spite of every effort from the organisers to drain the tournament of suspense, that crazy gang of Irish interlopers is on the march again. Global tournaments come to life when favoured teams are slain, and Ireland have just laid claim to one of the most prized scalps of the lot. #p#In so doing, finally, the permutations of this World Cup are wide open. England, having budgeted for four points from six at the midway stage of their group campaign, find themselves one point short of that tally after blowing two victories in three incredible days. That they had to settle for a share of the spoils against India, a team that had beaten them 11 times out of 12 on home soil, was forgivable, but to trip up against Ireland, and in such a sensational manner, has laid waste to all presumption about their natural progression to the quarter-finals. #p#Three tricky contests await in the coming days - against South Africa, Bangladesh and West Indies - and if they let their standards slip like this again, England are perfectly capable of losing all three, just as Ireland will believe they have the power to drag other stragglers into the mire as well, now that they have in their possession both the highest successful run-chase in the history of World Cup cricket, and the fastest century-maker in their instant legend, Kevin O'Brien. #p#Wednesday was Ireland's day, no question, but England are becoming the un-put-downable team of this tournament, and not for reasons they would covet. Like a cork bobbing on an estuary tide, they are somehow finding a way to rise and fall to match the expectations placed upon them - and that's been a pattern they've enacted with rhythmical poise ever since they floated up the Bay of Bengal to launch their warm-up phase in Fatullah. Frantic scramble against Canada; flowing triumph against Pakistan; loss of plot against Netherlands; chase for the ages against India; <m2>ultimate upset against Ireland</m2>... thumping win against South Africa in Chennai? Surely not! #p#The entertainment it provides is undeniable, but England would far sooner be a joyless, ruthless, victory machine - akin to the Australian sides of the 2000s whom they seemed so set upon matching during the first half of the winter - than the mercurial Pakistan-lite outfit that they're rapidly turning out to be. Lame shot selection, dreadful fielding, and an unmistakably snarky vibe between team-mates - most notably Graeme Swann and whoever had just fumbled his latest delivery - spoke of a bunch of players who've been on the road too long, and are most likely pretty sick of the sight of one another. #p#When Tamim Iqbal starts to go bonkers in Chittagong in a week's time, or when Imran Tahir ties the lower order in Chawla-style knots in Chennai, will it really help England's mindset to know that their highest first-innings total in the history of the 50-over World Cup was insufficient to save them from defeat against Ireland ? #p#"I don't tend to rank my lowest moments to be honest with you, it's not something I'm in the habit of doing," said Andrew Strauss, who can't have gone from hero to zero with quite such terminal velocity before. "But it's a bitterly disappointing day for us, there's no doubt about it. We were just thinking we were getting some momentum in this competition after the India game. We've given that away. We're not out of the World Cup by any means, but we're going to have to be better than we were today." #p#It's hard to see what England can do for a quick fix, however, after the pasting they have just been subjected to. The result might well focus the mind, just as it seemed the Netherlands near-miss had done - but focus it on what, exactly? When Tamim Iqbal starts to go bonkers in Chittagong in a week's time, or when Imran Tahir ties the lower order in Chawla-style knots in Chennai, will it really help England's mindset to know that their highest first-innings total in the history of the 50-over World Cup was insufficient to save them from defeat against Ireland ? #p#"I backed our bowlers and our fielders to put on a display that was going to be too tough for them to chase down, but we didn't do that and we've only got ourselves to blame," said Strauss. "But there's pressure everywhere and that's the way it should be in a World Cup. Hopefully it'll galvanise us as a team, because the equation is pretty simple now. We can't afford any slip-ups and we're going to have to go out there and deliver." #p#There's no point in second-guessing how England will perform from this point on. However, the faultlines are all too apparent, in far too many areas of the team, with hindsight now giving Andy Flower's end-of-match grimace against India a more knowing and sinister vibe. He's seen how effective his team can be when it's at the top of its game - never more so than at Melbourne and Sydney two months ago - and therefore he knows better than anyone how far from the mark they are right now. After all, if two of the best individual performances in England's history weren't sufficient to force a victory over India, it follows that anything less than a tour de force was going to leave them open to defeat. #p#The faultlines are apparent in several areas for England. AFP Enlarge #p#The defining feature of Ireland's innings - <m3>aside from the torrent of Kevin O'Brien sixes </m3>- was the absolute confidence that scoring opportunities would arise, even when the asking rate refused <m4>until the 48th over</m4> to dip as low as a run a ball. The defining feature of England's innings, by contrast, was of hot-blooded hitting at inopportune moments - first Strauss and Kevin Pietersen gave their starts away fecklessly, then the tail subsided in a wave of indisciplined slogging, the like of which Ireland didn't once consider matching. #p#Paul Collingwood and Matt Prior were once again the most culpable in that respect. If they had been listless against India, they were positively unhinged against the Irish, as both men lost their shape at the crease as soon as it became apparent that they could not find the boundary at will. #p#Collingwood, in particular, is currently batting as if he's on a weekend at Bernie's. Among all-time England six-hitters, he's second only to Andrew Flintoff, but his solitary maximum on Wednesday was a gift-wrapped half-volley after a stream of ugly smeared singles. Ravi Bopara, who spanked 45 from 16 balls in his most recent ODI innings against Bangladesh in July, is the only man who can come close to applying the touch of class that has been missing since the demise of Eoin Morgan. It's the one sadness of this tournament that such a fine finisher has been denied the stage on which to shine, but perhaps it's karma as well. Had Morgan been batting in those final five overs, there's no way England would have settled for 33 barrel-scraped runs. And it's all the less likely that his former countrymen would have won... #p#Other concerns refuse to go away. For the third match running, England's bowlers have been unable to recreate the pack mentality that propelled last year's World Twenty20 challenge. In consecutive innings Swann, Tim Bresnan, then Swann again have returned combined figures of 10 for 130 in 30 overs, which is the sort of all-out score that most Test nations would envisage against the Associates. #p#However, through a persistent and debilitating failure of their colleagues to hit the right length (most notably Anderson in the first two games, then the ailing Stuart Broad against Ireland) the remainder of England's attack has been bludgeoned into submission at every conceivable turn, by Sehwag in the Powerplay, Tendulkar in the middle overs, O'Brien and ten Doeschate at the death. The mantra that won England the Ashes - give the batsmen nothing to hit whatsover - has been lost in translation to the one-day format. #p#And talking of such format switches, there's also the peculiar case of Jonathan Trott to consider. His Test-match temperament allowed him to slip into exalted company during his 92 against the Irish, as he joined Viv Richards and Kevin Pietersen in reaching 1000 ODI runs in a record 21 innings. However, more speed, less haste is the rule by which one-day batsmen have these days to adher, and for a batsman as naturally reactive as Trott, his feats of crease occupation are starting to look problematic when there's an agenda that needs to be set. In each of England's last four matches in which they've batted first , he's amassed scores of 84 not out, 102, 137 and 92. England have achieved victory in just one of those contests, at Adelaide, and have failed to defend two scores in excess of 325. #p#England can and should extricate themselves from the mess they now find themselves in - despite their antipathy to overdog status, they remain a fiercely combative outfit. But having allowed themselves to give Ireland their leg-up, they cannot afford to let their destiny slip further from their grasp - the Irish, after all, have the Dutch still to come as their game in hand. And as for the vanquished, there are plenty other sides who will fancy a piece of a deeply-wounded team. Starting with AB de Villiers and chums on Sunday.

Players/Officials: Trent Johnston Matches: England v Ireland at Bangalore Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Ireland #p#The Ireland veteran Trent Johnston does not believe his country is ready for Test cricket despite <m2>Wednesday's triumph over England</m2>, which he described as "the greatest performance that Irish cricket has ever put on" However, Johnston said the Ireland team should be playing far more ODIs against the leading countries, and that they were spurred on by the ICC's decision to cut the next World Cup to 10 teams. #p#Johnston, 36, was captain of the Ireland side that upset Pakistan in the 2007 World Cup, but he said <m3>the win over England</m3> was a greater moment considering the size of the chase and the need to prove the Associates belong at the tournament. Ireland began with a fighting loss to Bangladesh and they are now a realistic chance to make the quarter-finals, but Johnston said talk of Test promotion was premature. #p#"I think Test cricket is probably a good while away," Johnston told ESPNcricinfo on the morning after Ireland's win. "We need to get things set up back in Ireland, the infrastructure and first-class setup and that sort of stuff. But one-day cricket and Twenty20, definitely, I think we proved yesterday that we can mix it with those guys. #p#"Without a World Cup in our season I'd say we'd play those guys two or three times a year, where we should be playing them 10 times a year. If we're doing that then we're beating Bangladesh in our first game because we know how to win those games. That's a big factor for us and Warren Deutrom, our CEO, has got a massive job on his shoulders to try and get us into that programme." #p#Last year, Ireland played four one-day internationals against Test-playing sides, two in Belfast against Bangladesh and one each against Australia and West Indies. The previous year, a one-off ODI against England, which Ireland lost by just three runs, was their only 50-over exposure to a full-member country, and this year they are scheduled to play another ODI against England in Dublin in August. #p#But it's at the World Cup that Ireland have really made their mark, after their St Patrick's Day triumph over Pakistan in 2007. In that tournament they also tied with Zimbabwe and in the Super Eights beat Bangladesh, but the Irish players could be watching the 2015 World Cup in Australia and New Zealand from a pub in Dublin, with pints of Guinness in hand. #p#"We have to prove that we want to be at the top table, it spurs us on a little bit more," Johnston said of the ICC's decision to reduce the number of teams. "At the end of the day it's a world game. It's not just the elites that play at World Cups. I think we warrant our selection there and warrant being there. I think we proved that against Bangladesh and we proved it yesterday against England, and hopefully we can do the same against India. #p#"We want to mix it with the big boys. We want to play those guys 10 or 20 times a year... We just go out there and enjoy each other's success. I think that's the biggest thing, we go out there as a team. Whether we go out and get flogged or we win comprehensively or we get over the line like we did last night, we enjoy each other's success. That's what it comes down to. We play for each other, and I honestly couldn't say there's too many teams in the World Cup could do that." #p#Johnston was speaking at the team hotel in Bangalore, where the Irish celebrations had lasted into the small hours of the morning after <m4>Kevin O'Brien's record-breaking 50-ball century</m4> set up <m5>their three-wicket win</m5>. Phones were ringing all through the night, calls coming from friends and family back home, as well as a host of interview requests from Irish radio stations. #p#And the success couldn't have come at a better time for Ireland, a country that has struggled with a serious financial crisis over the past couple of years. At the same time, there has been plenty of support for a cricket team that has gone from being made up almost entirely of amateurs to now being a thoroughly professional outfit. #p#"It's been a tough 18 months or two years for Ireland," Johnston said. "The economy is not doing so well and what have you, but sporting wise it gets the nation together. Yesterday would prove that. There were radio stations ringing left right and centre, and TV stations. It was just like four years ago, and that's great. That's one thing that we spoke about when we first came out here, was let's try to lift a nation, let's try to win a few games out here and it's not all doom and gloom. #p#"Four years ago we had two guys on central contracts and the rest of us were amateurs.

The big thing is that it's great for Irish cricket that we can get out there and perform on the world stage and put ourselves out there." #p#As long as the ICC lets them keep mixing it with the big boys.

There were, apparently, some signs of smoke. O'Brien Junior had misfielded, wrenched his knee and Niall, told ESPNcricinfo, he knew the runs were going to come because, "in the field he was grumpy, he was moping around... when he's like that, he tends to kinda take the bull by the horns as it were." Niall, 29, said, "I don't know why he was grumpy, I think he just slept badly or something, he had misfielded few balls, he hurt his knee and I just knew, that he had that kind of look in his eye." #p#The look in the eye turned into the power of Kevin's bat, "he's got that strength and the ability to hit the ball out of the ground," his brother said. <m1>Kevin's stormtrooper century</m1> (<m2>113 off 63b</m2>), the fastest at the World Cup (100 off 50 balls), set the record for the highest World Cup chase, and threw England's campaign into total turmoil after <m3>an upset three-wicket win</m3>. #p#Niall, wicketkeeper and Man of the Match during Ireland's stunning victory over Pakistan in the 2007 World Cup called <m4>the Irish win on Wednesday</m4> night, "regulation." The distance travelled by Ireland in the last four years, he said, should have prepared cricket for last night's performance. "In the last four years, we've come a long way. In 2007, we were only a few professional cricketers and we created a lot of shocks. These aren't shocks. #p#"Everyone is surprised, there is a lot of media hype, but for us, this is regulation. We should have beaten Bangladesh, we have beaten England." Ireland, he said, expected to win every game they played. "We play India on Sunday, we expect to win, we want to win. We have respect for every team we play against, equally they all have respect for us." <m5>Ireland's victory</m5> has now thrown open the group. #p#The next step for the team, O'Brien said, would be regular matches against the world's frontline teams, "We want to play cricket full-time, we want to play cricket all around the world, we want to travel to Australia, travel to India, travel to Sri Lanka, New Zealand, everywhere. We want to play cricket on the future tours programme." He said the team wanted to "give ourselves the chance" to play a good number of ODIs and T20Is every year. "They probably play 20-30 one day games, and 15-20 Twenty20s per year and we would love to do that for two-three years and see how we pan out. If after two-three years we are not good enough, so be it. At least we could try. I think we've got a great squad of players and we've got, I think, the strongest team spirit in this tournament." #p#The support given to the Irish by the Indian crowd, he said, meant that Ireland had the "Indian public behind us." The next step would be, "to play well for another two or three weeks and hopefully Indian cricket and the BCCI will get behind us, the strongest power in world cricket." The possibility of an IPL contract excited both brothers, "so hopefully we can do well and hopefully they will come and speak to us so that myself and Kevin come and live in India for a bit." Did he see himself on one of those giant advertising hoardings featuring cricketers now found on Indian streets? "It would be nice to get me and my brother up there, two very good looking men."

Players/Officials: Alex Cusack Matches: England v Ireland at Bangalore Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Ireland #p#In 2007, when Ireland were celebrating the other great triumph in their cricket history, Alex Cusack was still a carpenter by trade. Originally a Brisbane boy, he had two years earlier packed up his chisel and saw, his bat and helmet, and swapped the Queensland sun for the Dublin drizzle. #p#And on that St Patrick's Day, like many of his countrymen, he was watching Ireland stun the cricket world with victory over Pakistan in the World Cup. Four years later, he has played a key role in another joyous day for the cricket fans back home. #p#"I was sitting at home on the couch in Dublin, glued to the television. It's quite incredible looking back on it now," Cusack says. "Now I have a full-time cricket contract. If I never have to go back to a building site I'll be happy." #p#Cusack, 30, is softly spoken, and like his older Ireland team-mate Trent Johnston, he hasn't lost much of his Australian accent. The morning after <m2>the win over England</m2> he reflected on the part he played in <m3>a 162-run partnership with Kevin O'Brien</m3>, the star of the match. #p#"He was hitting them so well that I thought if I could just get the singles and get him on strike and chip in with a two or a four or whatever as well, that would keep the partnership ticking," he says. "I was just trying to play straight and get bat on ball. If anything was up there I was going to have a go at it." #p#<m4>And that's what Cusack the carpenter did, chipping away and building an innings of 47</m4> that, by the time <m5>he was run out</m5>, left Ireland needing 55 more from 51 balls. <m6>He walked off to cheers from the Irish fans at Chinnaswamy Stadium</m6>, and watched the rest of the victory unfold. #p#"Everyone in the rooms was cheering every run," he says. "The boys were 100% behind them. It was very nervy as well, but we just had a feeling at the end there that we were going to do it, it was going to be our day. #p#"Kevin's done it before, big innings like that in county cricket, I think it was against Hampshire he got 93 off about the same amount of balls. He's definitely got the ability, and once he's hitting them like that he's hard to stop." #p#But unlike some others in the Ireland side, Cusack, who got his passport because his father is Irish, is in no hurry to pursue a career in county cricket. He's happy sticking with Clontarf Cricket Club in Dublin. #p#"We've got the full-time contract with Cricket Ireland now, so there's no need for me to be trying to play county cricket," Cusack says. "I think they play too much cricket anyway. I'm happy enough with what I'm doing, it's a great ride. If I can keep it going for a few more years, all well and good. #p#"They play every bloody day. You look at other cricket like Australian cricket, they don't play anywhere near as much in state cricket. It's a lot of cricket to be playing, and then on top of that if you play for Ireland, I don't know how the boys do it." #p#Cusack is just happy to be an international cricketer and this week, the Irish fans are pleased he came to their country.

Players/Officials: Graeme Swann Matches: England v Ireland at Bangalore Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Ireland #p#Graeme Swann admitted that England were left shell-shocked by the manner and magnitude of <m2>their incredible three-wicket defeat at the hands of Kevin O'Brien on Wednesday night</m2>, but insisted that the team's best response would be to put the result right out of their minds as they turn their attention to Sunday's crucial showdown against the Group B pacesetters, South Africa, in Chennai. #p#As Ireland's celebrations continued long and loud in the wake of the biggest result of their lives, England flew out of Bangalore knowing that their World Cup campaign is in danger of sliding out of control, after three consecutive fixtures - including a thrilling tie with India - in which their frailties have been exposed with both bat and ball. However, with contests against South Africa, Bangladesh and West Indies still to come, qualification for the quarter-finals remains in their own hands, so long as they revert to winning ways at the earliest opportunity. #p#"If we are going to win this World Cup - which we truly believe we can - we've got to go out and prove it, and we do that first and foremost in the field," said Swann. "Four or five days ago, the whole world was saying 'Oh my God, England can win' this - because we didn't get destroyed by that invincible Indian team. We know the fickle nature of the world, and we're going to ignore that and just carry on and play the best cricket we can." #p#<m3>At 111 for 5</m3>, <m4>chasing a massive 328 for victory</m4>, Ireland's chances of victory were seemingly non-existent, until Kevin O'Brien climbed onto the offensive with the innings of his - or anyone else's - life. <m5>His incredible 50-ball century</m5> slammed England's bowlers onto the defensive, and <m6>in partnership with first Alex Cusack</m6> and <m7>then John Mooney</m7>, Ireland clawed their way back into the contest. #p#"It's disappointing to lose any game of cricket," said Swann. "But it was one where we got ourselves into a position of such dominance, to then have it taken away from us is quite shell-shocking. Every now and again someone wakes up and has the best day of their life - and yesterday Kevin O'Brien did that. We should have bowled better; we certainly could have bowled better, but that's tarnishing the knock he had - personally I think he won the game rather than we lost it." #p#Despite that assertion, the cracks in England's performance were visible long before O'Brien got going, with <m8>Matt Prior dropping a steepling chance behind the stumps to reprieve Ed Joyce</m8>, and Swann himself was visibly peeved with his fielders before <m9>claiming three quick wickets</m9> to put his team firmly in charge of the contest. "A lot of guys were peed off, and rightly so," he said. "We got ourselves into a position where the opposition were <m10>110 for five</m10>, with 20 overs to go. That's a game an international team of the calibre that we feel we are should win 10 out of 10." #p#"It's annoying in the extreme, but I'm not taking anything away from Kevin O'Brien and the performance of his life," Swann added. "It's the best knock I've seen in a long time. If a guy gets 100 off 60 balls [sic], a guy gets 100 off 60 balls. There's not a lot you can do, except say we should have bowled differently - and in the next game we will do. If we start panicking and thinking we're the disgrace that half the people on Twitter thought we were last night, there's no point in us playing. #p#"You can always bowl better," he added. "When <m11>a guy hits that many sixes</m11> you are obviously putting the ball in the wrong place. We could have bowled more yorkers and more slower balls wide of the wicket - that's easy in retrospect to say. When you're in the middle and the pressure is on with a guy going great guns, it can be difficult to think clearly. But we back ourselves to be professional and think clearly, so in future that's certainly something we have to look at."
15	552848	ODI batting winner	The night of the possible	Sharda Ugra	February 20, 2012	#p#Best ODI Batting Performance. <m1>Kevin O'Brien 113</m1>, World Cup, Bangalore #p#Kevin O'Brien would have been conspicuous anywhere that night in Bangalore. He had the physical frame of a tower block, the face of a 14-year-old, and pink hair. Or maybe purple. On March 2, 2011, O'Brien would have been hard to miss. #p#At the centre of the Chinnaswamy Stadium, not quite packed to its cavernous rafters, O'Brien made a statement that went beyond mere appearance. He became a human whirlwind. It was as if he had marched in and, in the space of a few hours, found the one thunderous command that made the cricket world pay attention to him and to Irish cricket. #p#Look at me, <m2>O'Brien's 113</m2> said. Look at us , look at what we can do. #p#O'Brien's innings will always form one of the most vivid memories of that World Cup. To begin with, it had number-crunchers leaping off their sofas. <m3>O'Brien's 100 in 50 balls</m3> smashed Matthew Hayden's record for the fastest World Cup century (off 66 balls) by almost three overs. O'Brien launched an almost Hayden-esque assault against a decent-enough record, with physical domination and contemptuous violence. #p#The speed and ferocity of O'Brien's game was compelling, but entangled as much into the power of that innings is what it brought: where the game was before O'Brien came to the crease and what he was able to make of it. #p#Two days before their match against Ireland, England had stolen some of India's wind, chasing a score of 338 down to a tie. They seemed to be warming up nicely, putting down scores of 290-plus in their first three matches, and batted first in Bangalore - as teams always do in ODIs - <m4>leaving Ireland 328 to chase</m4>. #p#<m5>Ireland were teetering at 106 for 4</m5> when <m6>O'Brien, their No. 6, walked in in the 23rd over</m6>. Those numbers will always whirl around O'Brien's legend but it is often forgotten that 12 balls later, <m7>Ireland were 111 for 5 in the 25th over</m7>. The batting had sunk into a bog. Half the innings was over and there were still 217 to get; to O'Brien, the math left him one option. #p#Older brother and Ireland wicketkeeper Niall said he'd seen something coming while looking at O'Brien in the field. "He was grumpy and moping around  When he's like that he tends to take the bull by its horns  he had misfielded, hurt his knee, and I just knew, that he had that kind of look in his eye." #p#England were blindsided. O'Brien faced Graeme Swann and Michael Yardy first-up, waited for a suitable sighter and teed off. <m8>Three fours in his first ten balls</m8> and the number of sighters began to increase. On the other side, his partner, Alex Cusack, made sure O'Brien, who had begun to wade into England's plans like they were Irish stew, was given enough strike. #p#The jury says... "Kevin O'Brien's knock was exceptional, given the stage and the opponent he was playing against. A World Cup hundred at the best of times is always something to be revered and something special. Coming against England it must have been a great source of pride for him, and the manner in which it was scored when his team was in the situation that it was  the type of power-hitting that he showed, the type of fearlessness that he showed, augurs well for him, his team. To me that was certainly one of the highlights of the World Cup, watching that on television and watching that demolition." Ian Bishop "The World Cup was the standout one-day event of 2011 and O'Brien's was the standout innings of the World Cup. Almost single-handedly he took Ireland from a hopeless position to <m9>their greatest victory</m9>, and one of the finest in World Cup history. He was equally destructive against pace and spin, and <m10>it took a run-out to stop him</m10>. He also did the cause of the Associates playing at future tournaments a world of good." Brydon Coverdale #p#Rarely did any team in the 2011 World Cup time <m11>its batting Powerplay</m11> as perfectly as Ireland did. In the tournament, batting Powerplays usually were a sign for teams rattling along calmly to suddenly go into crazy town and lose wickets. Not Ireland. <m12>Between the 32nd and 36th overs, O'Brien scored 45 of Ireland's 62 runs</m12>, including <m13>a stunning six over extra cover off Tim Bresnan</m13> and <m14>a 102-metre strike, the biggest six of the tournament, off James Anderson.</m14> #p#In that passage of play the game began to shift below England's feet and from then was on driven by Irish conviction. Early into his innings, O'Brien became the highest ODI scorer in Irish cricket, the fastest Ireland player to <m15>an ODI 50 - off 30 balls</m15> (the next 50 came in 20 balls). <m16>When the Powerplay ended, Ireland needed 99 at seven an over and O'Brien was 20 short of a century</m16>. It took him 11 balls to get there. #p#In the heart-pumping adrenaline of the chase, O'Brien's composure and Cusack's sangfroid are often forgotten. No matter how savage O'Brien's innings, at no stage was there unseemly haste. The England total was an edifice that would take some bringing down but O'Brien became the wrecking ball that kept coming at it. <m17>Cusack was out with 55 still left to get</m17> but <m18>their sixth-wicket partnership of 162</m18> had changed everything. <m19>O'Brien was out in the penultimate over, with only 11 to get, run out going for a second</m19>, but Ireland didn't waste his effort. <m20>They won by three wickets with five balls to spare, clinically finishing off the biggest chase in a World Cup</m20>. #p#Whenever there's a big score reeled out by an Associate (a more respectable word than the ghastly "minnow") batsman, it's usually accompanied by a round of patronising head-patting from the big boys. Not this time. #p#This one came against a stronger team and in the face of a tall total. It came at a time when the wicket was not threatening but the circumstances were. It was an innings that won not merely respect but also a World Cup match. In a tournament of superstars and strong competitors, Kevin O'Brien took Ireland to centre stage. #p#Given cricket's power structures, who knows how and where Ireland cricket will eventually go. But on any day that they make any stride, whenever they are in strife, they will remember <m21>O'Brien and the 113</m21>. It was the night of the possible, when it all began. And he started it.

16	503778	Netherlands v South Africa, Group B, World Cup 2011, Mohali	Mandatory change of ball can help seamers - Steyn	Firdose Moonda	March 1, 2011	#p#Dale Steyn, South Africa's premier fast bowler, has said the mandatory ball change after 34 overs in an ODI innings could benefit seamers in this tournament. "The change of ball helped to get some reverse swing," he said from Chandigarh. "We worked nicely on the second ball, and it has become clear that it's going to play a massive role." #p#On Thursday, at the Feroz Shah Kotla in Delhi, the West Indies lost six wickets for 68 runs after the change of ball, with three of the scalps going Steyn's way. The effect of the second ball was also pronounced in the game between England and India in Bangalore. England lost six wickets for 109 runs, as their slide was sparked by a spell from Zaheer Khan, who took three wickets. "He got [Andrew] Strauss and [Ian Bell] with reverse," Steyn said. #p#Conventional wisdom suggested that the batting team would benefit more from having a harder ball two-thirds of the way through their innings. New Zealand's Danny Morrison said that in the subcontinent, it may prompt teams to take the Powerplay at the ball change. "In these conditions that makes a lot of sense, provided you have wickets in hand. That's when you can launch," Morrison said. #p#Now, Steyn has added a new twist to the third Powerplay tale, which will come as good news to the seamers who may have felt that they were coming off second best to the spinners in this tournament. South Africa's pace quartet of Steyn, Morne Morkel, Lonwabo Tsotsobe and Wayne Parnell have said that there is no substitute for out-and-out pace and that even if the conditions favour spinners, a genuine quick is still a threat. #p#Dale Steyn expects the ball change to aid reverse-swing AFP Enlarge #p#They may be able to prove that on Thursday against Netherlands, who crumbled to the pace of Kemar Roach in Delhi. Steyn said that the Mohali pitch, where he's only played during the IPL, may suit the pacemen more. "From the stats apparently it's a bit better for fast bowling. I've heard it's a bit of a quicker deck." He's right in that the quicks usually find a bit more life in the pitch at the PCA Stadium. #p#Even if the conditions work to a seam bowler's advantage, Steyn said there are still significant differences between bowling in the subcontinent and bowling in South Africa. "You've got to be more street-smart over here. The full, wide ball doesn't bounce and finds the middle of the bat, it flies for four. In South Africa, it will bounce more and find the edge." Steyn's solution is in variation. "You can't bowl every single ball at the same pace in the same place." That's why he has been "throwing in a few cutters to reduce the speed from 140 to 120 kmph." #p#Steyn and the rest of the South African team have had ample time to think about different strategies, having spent two weeks in India before their first game against West Indies and then a week in between their first and second match. With a packed international schedule, Steyn said the players have welcomed the break and used it to ensure all the squad members are at their peak. #p#"There's a nice competition going on, because with everyone being fit for selection we're all competing for positions. When everyone is fit and there's so much time, everyone has a point to prove in practice sessions. It makes the coach and selection panel's job a bit difficult, but that's good." #p#It's also given players with niggles, such as Steyn, who hurt his right side during the warm-ups on Sunday, and JP Duminy, who had lower back pain, time to recover. Imran Tahir has also recovered from the respiratory tract infection he picked up. Although Tahir had an outstanding debut, conditions in Mohali may prompt Graeme Smith to leave out a spinner in favour of Tsotsobe, to give the left-armer some game time in the tournament. Tahir may get a few more days off but Steyn said if that is the case, it won't be because South Africa are resting players. "It won't be an easy game."

But there must be an upset brewing somewhere. Surely there must be. Netherlands v South Africa is unlikely to be the one, though, if the history of the two teams is any indication. They've met twice before, and South Africa have completed huge victories both times - a 221-run margin in the 2007 World Cup and a 160-run win back in 1996. #p#This World Cup has taught us two things about the Netherlands batting line-up. One is that they are capable of posting big totals, as they showed with a Ryan ten Doeschate-inspired 292 against England in their opening game in Nagpur. The second is that express pace bowling can be their downfall, as Kemar Roach's six-for demonstrated in their second game. And Dale Steyn qualifies as express, so they're in for a tough battle in Mohali. #p#South Africa will be aiming to notch up their second victory from two games, after they accounted for West Indies in their opening match on a slow surface in Delhi. There should be more pace in Mohali, which ought to suit an attack led by Steyn and Morne Morkel. #p#Form guide (completed matches, most recent first) Netherlands LLLLW South Africa WWWLL #p#Watch out for... #p#Tom Cooper was the one batsman who stood up against the pace of Roach on Monday. Although he was born and raised in Australia, Cooper qualifies to play for the Netherlands because his mother was born in Dutch New Guinea, which is now the Papua region of Indonesia. That European ancestry allowed him to play club cricket in Scotland as a non-overseas player, and it was there that he linked up with the Netherlands coach Peter Drinnen. An aggressive right-hander, Cooper is still trying to forge his first-class career with South Australia, but in the one-day format has been a revelation for the Netherlands, and how he handles quality bowlers like Steyn and Morne Morkel will go a long way to determining if his team can compete in this match. #p#Another man who is not representing the country of his birth is Imran Tahir , the Pakistan-born legspinner who has made South Africa home. He was impressive in his ODI debut, the World Cup win over West Indies a week ago, when he collected 4 for 41, and although he has battled a throat infection in the past few days he is expected to be fit to play. This tournament has been a long time coming for Tahir, who at 31 has been on the books at 16 different first-class sides throughout his career, from Pakistan to England to South Africa. Expect him to make the most of his opportunity. #p#Team news #p#There were a few gaps in the Dutch performance against West Indies, but the question is whether any of their backup players will add more to the side than if they were to again use the same starting XI. #p#Netherlands (possible) 1 Alexei Kervezee, 2 Wesley Barresi (wk), 3 Tom Cooper, 4 Ryan ten Doeschate, 5 Bas Zuiderent, 6 Tom de Grooth, 7 Peter Borren (capt), 8 Mudassar Bukhari, 9 Pieter Seelaar, 10 Bernard Loots, 11 Berend Westdijk. #p#South Africa had a few minor niggles to contend with during the week - Steyn (side), JP Duminy (back) and Tahir (throat infection) - but all three have recovered and should be available for selection. The main question is whether they will again choose three spinners - Tahir, Johan Botha and Robin Peterson - or opt for some extra pace, most likely from Lonwabo Tsotsobe. #p#South Africa (possible) 1 Graeme Smith (capt), 2 Hashim Amla, 3 Jacques Kallis, 4 AB de Villiers (wk), 5 JP Duminy, 6 Faf du Plessis, 7 Johan Botha, 8 Morne Morkel, 9 Dale Steyn, 10 Imran Tahir, 11 Lonwabo Tsotsobe. #p#Pitch and conditions The Mohali ground is gearing up for its first World Cup match of this tournament, and it could provide a little more pace than some of the other venues. #p#Stats and trivia #p#Ryan ten Doeschate is 20th on the ICC one-day international batting rankings list.

16	503856	Netherlands v South Africa, Group B, World Cup 2011, Mohali	South African trio overcome fitness concerns	Firdose Moonda in Mohali	March 2, 2011	#p#Dale Steyn was among three South African players to pass fitness Tests ahead of the game against Netherlands on Thursday. JP Duminy and legspinner Imran Tahir were the others. #p#Steyn injured his side after colliding with Graeme Smith during a football match during the team's warm up in Delhi on Sunday. Duminy had a lower back spasm and Tahir was suffering from a respiratory tract infection which is said to have cleared. #p#With the Mohali pitch likely to offer more for the seamers, there was speculation that South Africa would not go in with three spinners, as they did for the first match against West Indies. Tahir, in particular, was earmarked as the bowler to be rested, especially after falling ill. van Zyl indicated otherwise, saying that Tahir made an effort to adjust his follow through after he was warned for running on the pitch in Delhi. "We worked with him yesterday and we will do a bit more work on it today. It doesn't seem like it's a huge thing and it won't have any great effect on the way he bowls." #p#Dale Steyn was one of three South African players to undergo fitness tests ahead of the Netherlands fixture Getty Images Enlarge #p#If Tahir plays, it may mean no space for the two left-armers, Lonwabo Tsotsobe and Wayne Parnell, both of whom missed out on South Africa's first match. van Zyl said he is not allowing himself to be persuaded into leaving out some of his big-name players, irrespective of the fact that South Africa are playing an Associate team. "If you underestimate your opposition it may become tempting to do that," he said. "They are an opponent like any other and we are approaching them in exactly the same way." #p#The respect South Africa are treating the Netherlands with is a reflection of van Zyl's attitude towards the Associate teams. Even though the ICC plans to shut them out of the World Cup in 2015 and cut the tournament down to 10 teams, van Zyl thinks they add value to the global showpiece. "I think they need to be here. It's important for world cricket." #p#Left-arm spinner Pieter Seelaar caught the eye of van Zyl who described him as a "very good bowler" and said the attack in general "bowls well wicket to wicket." However, like many others, he feels their batting is their strength. "They have some really good batsmen. We saw how Ryan ten Doeschate performed against England." #p#Even though that batting line-up was reduced to 115 against the same West Indian side South Africa put to the sword, van Zyl said a big victory is not on his mind at all, and he wants his men to simply get the job done. "Our goals are not much more than winning the game."
16	503870	Netherlands v South Africa, Group B, World Cup 2011, Mohali	Borren rues not playing Full Members often	Firdose Moonda in Mohali	March 2, 2011	#p#Peter Borren, the Netherlands captain, was a shattered man after his team's 215- run defeat to the West Indies on Monday. He arrived at his post-match press conference looking exhausted, more emotionally than physically, and he offered no excuses for the batting line-up being shot out for 115 after the bowlers conceded 330. #p#He's had two days to let that disappointment marinate in his mind and now he has answers for why it happened. "It is very difficult coming into a competition to play Full-member teams when we haven't for a long while," Borren said in Mohali. "We don't play at this level enough and we played fantastically against England and poorly against West Indies and that's the second and third ODIs against Full members we've had in two years." #p#It's this lack of consistency of high-level competition that Borren says undoes the Associates at global tournaments, and it would do the same to any team, minnow or not, that wasn't continually playing some of the others. "How do you think a Full member would go if they didn't play other full members for four years and then had to come into this World Cup?," he asked the journalist who questioned why the Dutch had gone from a team that was competitive against England and rolled over against West Indies. #p#The opportunities for them to compete against Full-Member countries come rarely, with Netherlands only playing against one, Bangladesh, in their last 28 ODIs before this World Cup. They have never played a series against a Full member and spend most of their team competing against Afghanistan, Kenya, Canada and Ireland. While the Full members must abide by the ICC's Future Tours Programme, Borren says they make little effort to visit the Associates outside of that. "The same countries that say we shouldn't be at World Cups are the same ones that don't play us between World Cups and that's difficult." #p#Peter Borren has called for more games for Associate nations against the Full-member teams Associated Press Enlarge #p#Major tournaments present them with the chance to play more than one Full Member in a space of a few weeks and even though upsets are only occasional, Borren thinks the experience comes from simply being a part of the event. "I think we learn a lot," he said. "Some people say we don't learn much, but I disagree. We struggle to learn from playing a lot of games against the same teams. We need to play at higher levels at times to learn a bit more." #p#That's why, according to Borren, despite knowing that they may be in for a pounding, the Associate teams look forward to testing themselves against Full Members and judging whether or not they have improved. "It's exciting to play against the world's best players. It's a real big challenge and something to look forward to." #p#Results have become almost secondary to the Associate cause, especially as the tournament draws on and they've already registered a few losses. It's the small milestones, like batting out a full 50 overs, scoring a few more runs than the last time, conceding fewer boundaries and taking the tough catches, that start to matter. Borren calls it, "playing to our own standard," and he feels Netherlands "haven't reached or even come close to that" in their first two games. #p#Their bowling has been their biggest downfall. "We lost [against England] because we didn't bowl the right areas and we didn't do again against West Indies. I was not happy after the England game because I thought we could have bowled in better areas." Most of the team practices on artificial turf at home but that's not an excuse for Borren who wants a better showing from the bowlers. #p#Borren also wants more from all of his batsmen, and not just ten Doeschate. Although he called the performance against England "close to what we can do with the bat," he still thinks there is room for improvement. That innings was largely the work of ten Doeschate and Borren wants to see the rest of the batsmen "spending time at the crease and building partnerships." #p#The Dutch have had just three days to strategise about how they are going to improve almost all elements of their game. It may too little time to realistically think all the changes will be possible, but for Borren, it's been just enough time to be hungry enough to want to play for pride. "After what was a disappointing performance we can put it right tomorrow."

Players/Officials: Hashim Amla | AB de Villiers Matches: Netherlands v South Africa at Mohali Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Netherlands | South Africa #p#A day after Ireland's heroics in Bangalore gave the Associates a major fillip, normal service resumed in Mohali where AB de Villiers and Hashim Amla reeled off contrasting hundreds to set up a hammering of Netherlands. Peter Borren elected to field under overcast skies, but things unraveled at an alarming rate after a disciplined show in the first quarter of the match. Amla overcame a sluggish start and focused on accumulation, while <m7>de Villiers shredded the attack in a blaze of big hits</m7> that was reminiscent of Herschelle Gibbs' assault in the last World Cup encounter between these two teams. South Africa's bowlers then backed up the batting with a near-perfect display to set up <m8>the fourth-biggest win</m8> in World Cup history. #p#Smart Stats. <m9>AB de Villiers has now scored two consecutive centuries in the 2011 World Cup</m9>. He becomes the first South African to score two centuries in a single World Cup and the fifth batsman after Mark Waugh, Saeed Anwar, Rahul Dravid and Matthew Hayden to score two consecutive centuries in a single World Cup tournament. de Villiers also became the 16th batsman to score two or more centuries in one World Cup tournament. The record is three centuries in one tournament, jointly held by Mark Waugh (1996), Sourav Ganguly (2003) and Matthew Hayden (2007). de Villiers' strike rate of 136.73 is the highest among South African batsmen who have scored centuries in World Cup matches. <m10>Hashim Amla reached his first century in World Cups off 121 balls</m10>. Overall, he has scored over 2200 runs at an average of 60.07 with eight centuries and 12 fifties. <m11>The 69 runs scored in South Africa's batting powerplay</m11> is second only to Pakistan's aggregate of 70 runs in their batting powerplay against Kenya. <m12>The 221-run stand between de Villiers and Amla</m12> is the highest third-wicket partnership for South Africa in World Cups and the third highest for any team in the World Cup. It is also <m13>the highest partnership for the third wicket for South Africa</m13> in all ODIs. <m14>South Africa's 351</m14> is their third-highest World Cup score and the 12th highest score for any team in World Cups. South Africa's highest World Cup score is the 356 against West Indies in the 2007 World Cup. From <m15>a decent position of 81 for 2</m15>, <m16>Netherlands lost their last eight wickets for just 39 runs</m16> to be <m17>bowled out for 120</m17>. <m18>The 231-run win</m18> is the fourth largest margin of victory for any team in World Cups and the largest for South Africa in World Cups. It is also the second largest margin of victory for South Africa in ODIs. With his third player of the match award in World Cups, de Villiers is joint second with Jacques Kallis on the list of South African players with most match awards in World Cups. Lance Klusener heads the list with five awards. #p#Chasing 352, Netherlands' best chance of getting anywhere depended on the top order's ability to see off Dale Steyn and Morne Morkel. The openers played out six overs from South Africa's fastest bowlers, but <m19>Jacques Kallis ruined their efforts by snaring two quick wickets after coming in first-change</m19>. With the run-rate under control, Graeme Smith deployed his spinners on the lower order, and Netherlands sank without a trace, <m20>losing their last seven wickets for 39 runs against Imran Tahir and Robin Peterson</m20>. #p#The margin of victory completely eclipsed Netherlands' spirited efforts with the new ball. Their steady army of seamers stuck to tight lengths, and their accuracy left Smith prodding uncertainly from the outset, unsure of his footwork and indecisive in his outlook. <m21>After 31 balls of struggle, Smith had seen enough, and lost his leg stump while trying to shovel Bernard Loots across the line</m21>. <m22>Ryan ten Doeschate then won the first round in the battle of the prolific allrounders, strangling Kallis into glancing one down the leg side through to the wicketkeeper Wesley Barresi.</m22> <m23>At 58 for 2 in the 16th over, South Africa were in some strife</m23>. Thankfully for them, their two best batsmen in recent times were on hand to revive the innings. Even their most optimistic fans, though, would not have envisaged the emphatic manner in which the tide was turned. #p#Restless to put the failure against West Indies behind him, Amla tried to kick off his World Cup career by disregarding the lengths, and punching on the up. <m24>He nearly paid the price in Berend Westdijk's third over, when his drive fell just short of the man at short cover.</m24> <m25>In Mudassar Bukhari's next, he mishit another forcing shot through the off side, getting an inside edge that was pouched by Barresi on the bounce.</m25> Amla tightened his approach following <m26>the two reprieves</m26>, resorting to deflections behind square, and compact drives down the ground. <m27>His first eight balls yielded three fours</m27>, but <m28>he got only one more - a fortuitous inside edge to fine leg off ten Doeschate</m28> - on his way to <m29>a vital half-century</m29>. #p#As he had done against West Indies, de Villiers checked in with a surge of immaculate boundaries, <m30>flicking and cutting ten Doeschate for fours in the 18th over</m30>. They were shots of intent that changed the complexion of the game, ending a period of nearly ten overs in which <m31>South Africa's only boundary was Amla's edge to fine leg</m31>. <m32>de Villiers then went on to expose Netherlands' limitations, leaving the accumulation to Amla and throwing punches in all directions. He looted boundaries in all but two of the overs between 27 and 35, pinging boundaries in a comprehensive arc from third man to midwicket, with shots ranging from the revers- sweep to the slapped flick.</m32> While his improvisation was top class, the hallmark of his innings remained the trademark crunched cover-drives whenever the bowlers over-pitched. #p#<m33>Netherlands enjoyed a boundary-drought between overs 36 and 41</m33>, but it was clearly a case of the batsmen calibrating their guns for a final assault. <m34>Amla strolled to one of his quieter hundreds in the 40th over</m34>, and <m35>South Africa took the batting Powerplay soon after</m35>. <m36>de Villiers began the carnage by lapping Pieter Seelar for the first six of the innings</m36>, before <m37>reaching his century off 88 balls</m37>. <m38>His next ten deliveries brought him 34 runs</m38>, as he <m39>smashed Loots for three successive sixes</m39> and then <m40>ten Doeschate for a hat-trick of fours</m40>. <m41>Netherlands managed to dismiss both batsmen in quick succession</m41>, but it was scarce solace as <m42>the Powerplay went for 69</m42>. The fields fell back for the last four overs, but that did not seem to affect <m43>Duminy, who kept getting under length deliveries to swing four gleeful sixes</m43>. Netherlands must have known they were out of the game once <m44>South Africa finished with 351</m44>. Unfortunately, they did not have Kevin O'Brien in their ranks. #p#Match Timeline

AFP Enlarge Related Links Matches: Netherlands v South Africa at Mohali Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Netherlands | South Africa #p#The almost catch of the day. <m1>The Dutch were on the verge of an early breakthrough when Hashim Amla got the bottom edge of his bat to connect with a Mudassar Bukhari slower ball. Wicketkeeper Wesley Barresi had to get forward to pouch a dying ball and if he'd moved one step further he may have. He got to the ball just as it grazed the grass but Barresi was hoping he'd grabbed it in time. Amla was already walking when umpire Richard Kettleborough sought the assistance of a replay that showed the ball had bounced ahead of the keeper.</m1> #p#Whiplash of the day. AB de Villiers rightly chose <m2>the Powerplay</m2> as the time to lash out and <m3>for three balls it looked as though Bernard Loots would suffer the same fate as Dan van Bunge did four years ago at the hands of Herschelle Gibbs - six sixes</m3>. <m4>The first six was massive enough to illustrate that intent, a powerful swing that sent the ball somewhere into the Punjab sky.</m4> <m5>The second one, a straight loft, was being so closely watched by the long-on fielder that he tumbled into the advertising boards</m5> and <m6>the third one was a monster pull over midwicket</m6>. <m7>Much to Loots' relief, he got the yorker right with his fourth ball and de Villiers could only manage a nudge for one.</m7> #p#The best supporting actor of the day. Morne van Wyk was brought into the team because they thought they would need another batsman on a pitch that appeared difficult to bat on. <m8>He only got to spend one ball at the crease, which he watched from the non-strikers end and then galloped through for two runs and managed to put in an athletic dive at the end.</m8> He was able to do more in the second half of the match. de Villiers did not join his colleagues in the field because he strained his back while batting, so van Wyk was handed the wicketkeeping gloves. #p#The reflex of the day. <m9>Jacques Kallis was made to react quickly off the first ball he bowled. Alexei Kervezee drove straight back at Kallis and the ball drifted a little past his right shoulder. Kallis could have let one of mid-on or mid-off scramble after it but he was up in a flash and reached over to grasp it. He had to juggle a little but had the catch in his clutches on the second attempt.</m9> #p#The yo-yo referrals. Things were getting desperate with <m10>Netherlands on 119 for 8</m10> and Imran Tahir was bowling every ball at his disposal to end it quickly. <m11>He hurled a flipper at Bernard Loots and trapped him right in front of middle stump. Loots wanted to hang around and asked for a review, which showed no contact with the bat and his marching orders were upheld.</m11> <m12>Tahir rapped Bernerd Westdijk on the pad with his next ball, this time not out was the on-field call and South Africa reviewed. Westdijk was struck outside the line and Kettleborough was proved right again.</m12> <m13>Westdijk didn't last long after that, he was hit on the pad for the second time in succession and given out. He had to upkeep the reviewing tradition of that over but it was no use - three out of three for the on-field umpire and Nethrelands bowled out inside 35 overs.</m13>

News : Borren upbeat despite defeat. Players/Officials: Hashim Amla | AB de Villiers | Graeme Smith Matches: Netherlands v South Africa at Mohali Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: South Africa #p#Imagine if you could tell a man's batting style by the way he looked. Jacques Kallis would be dopey, Stuart Broad would be delicate and Charles Coventry would be a nudger and nurdler. Not so, of course. But in some cases it does apply. Yusuf Pathan is destructive, Younis Khan is thoughtful and Shane Watson is flashy. #p#It also worked for Hashim Amla and AB de Villiers in their respective innings against the Netherlands. Amla, with his sagely beard and neatly perched glasses, was a patient planner while de Villiers, with his surfer blonde hair and cheeky smile, was fun-loving, mischievous and carefree. <m3>Together they put on the highest third-wicket partnership</m3> Mohali has seen in one-dayers, and although the statistic is a feat in itself, it was the way they went about crafting their respective innings that made each one so special. #p#Amla had to do the harder work. Conditions were tricky upfront, with moisture hanging in the air, a chilly breeze whipping through the ground and a patchy, two-paced wicket. He started off playing the game we've come to call his natural one, hitting flourishing fours on the off side and one luxurious pull to fine leg. While he was initially connecting well, he soon started edging more than he was middling and with Graeme Smith poking about awkwardly at the other end, he had no choice but to retreat and regroup. #p#Mudassar Bukhari was a different bowler to the one who had been so mercilessly torn into by West Indies and as he found better lines and lengths, the batsmen had to find better ways of seeing him off. <m4>He almost had Amla twice in the first ten overs</m4>, <m5>once when a bottom edge fell just in front of wicketkeeper Wesley Barresi</m5> and then <m6>when he reviewed an lbw shout only to prove the umpire's not-out verdict right</m6>. #p#As the sun came out, batting became easier and Amla started to settle. He still wasn't able to drive with great confidence and had to work the ball around, concentrating on his pushes. Jacques Kallis was under the same strain, driving away from the body, more like he was at the wheel of a rusty old Volkswagen Beetle that just did not want to get started than the seat of a sleek German sedan. <m7>When he nicked one down the leg side, three balls after the first two Powerplays were completed</m7>, de Villiers arrived at the crease with fresh eyes. #p#"I had to stick to my game plan more than usual because of the conditions. I wasn't actually that positive but I knew I had to focus on the basics more than normal," de Villiers said. His basics, when it comes to batting, include rotating the strike. Although he was able to sink his teeth into two wayward Ryan ten Doeschate deliveries, the bulk of his early time at the wicket was spent knocking the ball around. #p#For eight overs and four balls, de Villiers and Amla scrambled. As the ball got older and the conditions became more batsman friendly, the scramble became simpler. The gaps were there for puncturing, and the singles were offering themselves like water to a thirsty man. The flow tired Netherlands' bowlers and then the boundary balls started coming, almost one an over. When the bowlers tightened, de Villiers and Amla were back to small-steps mode. Push, run, dab it down, run two, nudge, run again, flick away, run two. #p#<m8>Between them, they scored 108 singles and 22 runs in twos</m8>. They got into a rhythm and it frustrated the opposition, while adding, little by little, to the nest they were building. "AB and Hashim played magnificently," Smith said. "We knew that we had to set up a base and once we did that we could attack." #p#The attack came in <m9>the batting Powerplay</m9>, as it rightly should, but hasn't always in this World Cup. It's been a five-over period where the batsmen have gone for shots they would otherwise keep for garden cricket with their mates and, in so doing, have fallen. Amla and de Villiers did otherwise. The former hung back a little, indicative of his whole innings, while the latter launched. <m10>He hit the first six of the innings in the 42nd over</m10> and <m11>then smashed three more</m11>. #p#It was unexpected for such flair to come from a man who had struggled in the nets in Delhi. "I didn't get a good net there, I think the practice facilities were quite tough," de Villiers said. Bad net, good knock it seems as he was seeing the ball like a balloon. "I think we paced it well and I felt I had the freedom to express myself." #p#<m12>Both de Villiers and Amla were dismissed in the Powerplay</m12>, but they added 69 runs and <m13>theirs were the only two wickets to fall</m13>. It set <m14>JP Duminy up for the cameo of his career, an audacious 40 off 15 balls.</m14> "If I could have played some of the shots JP played, I would have retired today," Smith joked. Duminy: there's another one who doesn't look like he bats - timid, meek and mild. Not at all.

Players/Officials: Graeme Smith Matches: Netherlands v South Africa at Mohali Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: South Africa #p#Graeme Smith has joined the growing debate over the 2.5m clause in the UDRS by saying he was aware of the rule and understood it. Smith has not yet had to deal with the practical implications of the clause, although there were two instances in the match between South Africa and Netherlands in Mohali where it could have come into play. #p#<m2>Bas Zuiderent was given out lbw to Robin Peterson in the 22nd over of Netherlands' innings. Zuiderent was struck low on the front foot and was given his marching orders by Asoka da Silva. He did not review the decision but replays showed the impact was 2.5 meters from the stumps.</m2> <m3>The second incident was when Imran Tahir dismissed Berend Westdijk, who was the last wicket to fall. The on-field umpire ruled that Westdijk was out but the batsman called for a review. Replays showed that the point of impact on Westdijk's pad was 2.5 metres from the stumps as well.</m3> #p#<m4>Zuiderent's decision</m4> was not reviewed and <m5>Westdijk's decision</m5> was not changed because the on-field umpire had initially ruled that he was out. #p#According to the ICC's manual for the review system, if an "out" decision is reviewed, in order to prove that "the ball is missing the stumps, the evidence of the technology should show that no part of the ball would have made contact with any part of the stumps or bails." In the South Africa v Netherlands match, the 2.5m rule would have helped both batsmen had they been ruled not out and the fielding side had reviewed the decision, as was the case with Ian Bell against India. #p#While it sounds tricky, Smith said that had he been faced with the incident, he would have known what to do. "I am fine with it because it was communicated to us. I understood the rule so whether you agree or disagree with it, that's the way we were told it was going to be in this tournament. It's pretty simple I guess, you know what to expect." #p#Smith spoke with the kind of confidence in the law that his Indian counterpart does not have. MS Dhoni criticised the rule, calling it an "adulteration" of technology with human judgement, after the Ian Bell incident. Dhoni and India have never been in favour of the UDRS system and only used it in one Test series, its inaugural one against Sri Lanka in 2008, rejecting it for all others, before being forced to use it at this World Cup. #p#The ICC, through general manager Dave Richardson, had asked for Dhoni to read through the rules, as Smith claims he has done. The BCCI reacted in a strongly worded letter to the ICC, accusing them of putting unnecessary pressure on the Indian team. #p#The 2.5m rule exists because that is the distance that experts have identified at which the accuracy of Hawkeye begins to falter, leaving room for the on-field umpire's discretion to be used.
16	504121	Netherlands v South Africa, Group B, World Cup 2011, Mohali	Borren upbeat despite defeat	Firdose Moonda at the PCA Stadium	March 3, 2011	#p#Peter Borren strode into his post-match conference after <m1>his team's 231-run loss to South Africa</m1> with his chest puffed out. <m2>The defeat</m2> was the largest margin of humiliation in this World Cup but his eyes were brighter than they were after they went down to the West Indies, his smile was shyly peeking out and his voice didn't crack and waver as it had then. #p#"We bowled really well in the first 40 overs," he said proudly. "We just didn't take the wickets we needed to create pressure." <m3>The Dutch bowlers had kept South Africa to 43 runs within the first 10 overs</m3>, <m4>108 at the halfway stage</m4> and <m5>215 in 40 overs</m5>. #p#The problem, as Borren said, was wickets. <m6>After 40 overs, South Africa had lost just Graeme Smith and Jacques Kallis and had two centurions at the crease</m6>. They'd given themselves enough time and enough batsmen to launch from there and launch they did. "Hashim Amla and AB de Villiers are both magnificent players and it was a good experience for us to see how they batted. Even when they weren't hitting boundaries they were taking singles." #p#It seems as though Borren and his team have got over the ignominy of hefty defeats and are starting to view their World Cup games as learning experiences and time to play against the Full Members that they hardly ever get outside of major tournaments. Borren spoke about the team setting their own targets and playing to try and achieve those, instead of to get results and notch up upsets. Today, he thinks they did that, in part. "In those first 40 overs, we bowled to our own standards," he said. #p#Netherlands were happy with their bowling for the first 40 overs. AFP Enlarge #p#Borren chose to put South Africa in because he wanted to give his bowlers an opportunity to capitalise on the conditions. With rain around and some juice expected in the pitch, he hoped that they would be able to snag a few big guns and "get their middle-order players in early." They weren't able to do that, but doesn't frustrate him entirely; it's their showing with the bat that does. "We didn't bat to our standards so we let ourselves down again," he said. #p#With the Netherlands putting on such a commanding performance against England with the bat, it was that aspect of their game that was talked up as their strength and Borren was disappointed with how they fared in their last two outings. "I think the pressure of chasing big scores got to us." When asked if he wasn't inspired by Ireland's supreme effort in chasing 329 against England, he grinned. Perhaps they weren't inspired, they were awed. #p#"Full credit to Ireland for the way they played in the second half of their innings. Kevin O'Brien's century was incredible," Borren said. "I think if you tried to emulate that, you wouldn't be able to for 1000 years." #p#His answer almost reflected what everyone has been saying: that the gulf between the Associates and the Full Members is too great and that the smaller teams don't have any reason to believe they'll be able to close it. Borren didn't even feel his team could match the performance of another Associate. #p#In some ways, that carefree attitude should stand them in good stead for their remaining matches, because it will take away the burdens they've had to prove themselves up to now. The Netherlands next outing is against India and instead of wanting to cause an upset, Borren said they are just looking forward to the spectacle. "India are a magnificent cricket team. Hopefully we will do a bit better than we did today but to play them at home is going to be a great occasion."
17	503866	Canada v Pakistan, World Cup 2011, Group A, Colombo	Pakistan mull changes ahead of Canada game	Osman Samiuddin in Colombo	March 2, 2011	#p#Pakistan are striving to strike a balance between experimentation and momentum, always a tricky proposition, ahead of their group game against Canada at the R Premadasa on Thursday. Pakistan are currently unbeaten at the top of Group A, and have fielded unchanged line-ups in their first two games against Kenya and Sri Lanka. #p#Under normal circumstances they would be loath to change a winning XI, but an injury and an opportunity to rest senior players in what is still a long road ahead, is likely to see them make changes in personnel, if not strategy. Abdur Rehman is out with an adductor muscle injury, so Saeed Ajmal has a strong chance to make his World Cup debut. #p#Pakistan will also consider whether or not to rest Shoaib Akhtar; the management are keen to handle the 35-year-old fast bowler with care and he played a starring role in a full ten-over performance against Sri Lanka. #p#Wahab Riaz would be a more than able replacement, but as a former fast bowler, Waqar Younis, the Pakistan coach, knows that rest is not always the best way to go. #p#Pakistan might choose to rest Shoaib Akhtar for their game against Canada AFP Enlarge #p#"We haven't decided on the team yet," Waqar said. "We are thinking about it [of resting Shoaib] but then again, at this age or time, sometimes rest is not good, because you want to get that rhythm and momentum going. You don't want to take too long a rest because it is too hot and you need to be used to that. So I'm not sure at the moment." #p#The magnitude of the event also means that Pakistan want to keep their best XI playing in every game for the sake of momentum and togetherness. "To an extent it is true but then this is a big tournament and you don't want to take a risk, you want to have you best team available to play every match so that you don't lose momentum," Waqar said. "There are a couple of niggles, like Misbah's [ul-Haq] hamstring, but he is okay. Rehman has a problem, but the tournament is such that we want to play our team every match. #p#"I don't think there is any easy match or one that can be taken lightly. We played well against Sri Lanka, but it's still early days. There are bigger teams ahead. It's good that we won against Sri Lanka, but tomorrow's another game and we need to come out and keep the momentum going." #p#Pakistan have only played Canada once in an ODI, an eight-wicket win at the 1979 World Cup, so this is unchartered territory for both teams. They met at a Twenty20 quadrangular tournament in Toronto in August 2008 but that is it. "We played against them last year in Canada [2008] and we have seen a little bit of them," Waqar said. "We have seen the videos, so we are going to see the game before we play them tomorrow but we are fully prepared for every single game."
17	503876	Canada v Pakistan, Group A, World Cup 2011, Colombo	Struggling Canada hope to compete	The Preview by Siddhartha Talya	March 2, 2011	#p#Match Facts March 3, Colombo Start time 14.30 (0900 GMT) #p#Canada need John Davison to fire AFP Enlarge Related Links Features : Pakistan finally focus on fielding News : Pakistan mull changes ahead of Canada game News : Self-belief key to recovery, says Davison News : Razzaq wants larger role News : Rehman to miss Canada match Matches: Canada v Pakistan at Colombo (RPS) Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Canada | Pakistan #p#The Big Picture #p#A game between two countries continents apart will be infused with a strong South Asian flavour on Thursday. Canada's been the adopted home of more than a million immigrants from the subcontinent, including the bulk of the national team, and the Toronto suburbs of Brampton, Missisauga and Scarborough, each with a significant South Asian population, will have some watching the potential mismatch with more than a reasonable interest. #p#There's much at stake for Canada. Their performances, including a meek surrender against Zimbabwe, have, in the eyes of many, justified the ICC's decision to shrink the next World Cup. Some of their more experienced players weren't picked in the World Cup squad; instead, five players from the Under-19 level, fresh to international cricket, were given a go, raising concerns over whether the best-available XV were selected. Their senior cricketers, Ashish Bagai and John Davison, have failed to step up. The only consolation is that their group members, Kenya, have had a worse time this tournament. For those at home with competing loyalties, a determined display against Pakistan would prove a satisfactory result. #p#Pakistan, eyeing a third straight win, would want a performance as dominating as the one against Kenya, but it remains to be seen whether they choose to tweak their combinations in a game with little room for surprise. #p#Form guide (completed matches, most recent first) #p#Pakistan : WWLWW Canada : LLLWW #p#Watch out for... #p#Mohammad Hafeez : He has proven to be a reliable opener for Pakistan since the start of 2010, but has often been dismissed after getting a good look-in at the crease. Hafeez has made three half-centuries and a ton, apart from a spate of 30s, in the last year. He's gifted with timing, is solid in defence and has the ability to bat out an innings. The Canadian bowling offers him a a good chance to dig in. #p#John Davison : The oldest player in the competition and Canada's big-name player has had a horrible two games with ducks in each. There was little hope against Sri Lanka in a mammoth chase but his team needed a strong start from Davison against Zimbabwe, an opposition Canada had hoped to beat at the start of the tournament. Without any impetus at the start of the innings, the rest of the Canadian batting appears to switch focus to survival rather than pushing on. With so much responsibility on his shoulders, Davison needs to set an example. #p#Team news #p#The fitness status of Henry Osinde remains unclear, but it would be worth it to promote their frontline batsman, Zubin Surkari, and allrounder Rizwan Cheema up the order. They batted at No.7 and No.6 respectively against Zimbabwe, coming in well after the game had been decided. There is also talk of Davison moving down the order. #p#Canada (possible): 1 John Davison, 2 Nitish Kumar, 3 Ruvindu Gunasekera, 4 Ashish Bagai, 5 Rizwan Cheema, 6 Zubin Surkari, 7 Jimmy Hansra, 8 Tyson Gordon, 9 Khurram Chohan, 10 Harvir Baidwan, 11 Balaji Rao. #p#Left-arm spinner Abdur Rehman has been ruled out of Thursday's game with an injury to his adductor muscle; offspinner Saeed Ajmal could well make his World Cup debut. Misbah-ul-Haq has a hamstring niggle but is expected to be fit while there is uncertainty over whether Pakistan will rest Shoaib Akhtar. If they do, left-arm seamer Wahab Riaz could be picked. #p#Pakistan (possible): 1 Ahmed Shehzad, 2 Mohammad Hafeez, 3 Kamran Akmal (wk), 4 Younis Khan, 5 Misbah-ul-Haq, 6 Umar Akmal, 7 Shahid Afridi (capt), 8 Abdul Razzaq, 9 Umar Gul, 10 Saeed Ajmal, 11 Shoaib Akhtar/Wahab Riaz. #p#Stats and trivia #p#The Canadian squad features three Pakistan-born players - Rizwan Cheema, Khurram Chohan and Hamza Tariq. Chohan has been part of the Pakistan Under-19 team. #p#Shahid Afridi became the 11th bowler to take 300 wickets in ODIs during his four-wicket haul against Sri Lanka. He is the first Pakistan spinner and the third overall to achieve that feat. #p#The two teams last met in an ODI in the 1979 World Cup. The South Asian presence in the Canadian XI back then was limited to two players. #p#Quotes #p#"Personally for me, it's more of a mental game. I am 40 years old and probably have those self-doubts... do I have the ability to perform at this level?" John Davison admits his problem is in the mind. #p#"We are thinking about it [of resting Shoaib] but then again, at this age or time, sometimes rest is not good, because you want to get that rhythm and momentum going."

17	503894	Canada v Pakistan, Group A, World Cup 2011, Colombo	Self-belief key to recovery, says Davison	Osman Samiuddin in Colombo	March 2, 2011	#p#If every player was as honest as Canada's John Davison, sportsmen might not be 'professional' anymore. So couched are most reactions to wins, individual performances, highs and lows, in cliché-built nothings of professionalism, they can be scripted without actually speaking to a player. And if they were as self-deprecating as Davison, then press conferences might become a popular pastime. #p#Davison is soon to be at an age when men start worrying about life ahead of them and buy a flash car to smooth those brows. Perhaps that's unkind on a 40-year-old but doubts, as he so candidly admits, are creeping in. He has a grand total of zero runs from two innings and nine balls faced as an opener in this World Cup. He first thinks it might be "a little bit of a lack of technique" in his case, though admittedly the ball Thisara Perera did him with at Hambantota wasn't half-bad. #p#"Personally for me, it's probably more a mental game," he said. "I'm 40 years old and probably have those self-doubts that do I have the ability to perform at this level? I've been hitting the ball pretty well in the nets and I just need to give myself a little time to get in. I got a good ball against Sri Lanka, I'll give hats off to the bowler there. But against Zimbabwe I had a game-plan and I wanted to hit [Ray] Price over mid-off early but probably could've given myself a few more balls to get in. I don't think it's too far away." #p#He was asked about tomorrow's likely team and if he had known it he would've given it. There is talk, he said, of him moving away from the new ball, as if he was a reporter reporting on his own troubles. "I'm not a 100% sure what the team is tomorrow but there is talk of me shuffling down the order I haven't got a leg to stand on so I'll bat wherever they tell me to right now." #p#The problem for him, John Davison says, is the mind AFP Enlarge #p#Canada might need Davison version 2003 to bat through positions 1-10 given the kind of form their other batsmen have been in. Their top score is Rizwan Cheema's 37 in the opening game of the group against Sri Lanka and collectively have crumbled for 122 and 123. There is genuine talent in the squad - in the young slip of a boy Nitish Kumar - and other, rougher delights in Cheema and Hiral Patel, but such is the Associate's plight. Pakistan's attack, whatever shape it takes, will not make life any easier. #p#"If you look at the scoreboard you'd probably say yes [the top order has been a problem]," Davison said. "I don't think necessarily the bowling has been getting us out, possibly in my own case probably a little bit of a lack of technique and a couple of younger guys lacking a bit of self-belief. If you come to watch them in the nets you'll see they've got talent. If they can clear their heads in a certain way to perform in the middle, it'll give them the best chance to being successful." #p#This campaign is Davison's third and "not so great compared to the others." Canada have on occasion been competitive in the past, at the very least their batting; in 2007 they made 228 and 249 against England and New Zealand respectively, performances they want to repeat. But the side is "pretty down" at the moment. #p#The one, admittedly small, consolation is that they are up against a side tomorrow that Associates must allow themselves to dream against. Pakistan is the ultimate Associate lottery, a game against them the day one man writes his own legend. It has happened twice at the World Cup. #p#"We have to have our best day and they have to have their worst day," Davison said when asked to rate the chances of an upset. "You always go into the game with some hope of winning it otherwise you don't turn up. We'll go into the ground hoping to deliver a good performance and hopefully Pakistan have a poor day which they have done in the past on many occasions. #p#"We haven't played them before. They're a great team and a very varied attack. For example we have our challenges in reading their spinners. One of the biggest challenges in the subcontinent is to play reverse-swing in later overs." #p#The bad news is they haven't got much help from their two Pakistan-origin players, Cheema and Khurram Chohan. "It's quite interesting that the two Pakistani guys are quite shy," Davison said. "It takes a lot of prodding to get a lot of information out of them. Maybe if we sit them down tonight and we prod them they might be able to give us some more information."

Matches: Canada v Pakistan at Colombo (RPS) Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Canada | Pakistan #p#Where Ireland went, Canada could not follow as their dreams of a World Cup fairytale were blown away by Shahid Afridi. For three-quarters of the game Canada had hustled Pakistan into a corner, only for <m9>Afridi to lash out with five wickets</m9> to seal Pakistan's qualification to the quarter finals. #p#While Afridi's speculative batting may long since have gone bust, his bowling has grown into a model of menacing consistency which has placed him well in front as the tournament's leading wicket-taker with 14 scalps from three games. #p#Chasing <m10>a modest 184</m10> after a lethargic Pakistan batting effort, <m11>Canada had scrapped hard to reach 104 for 3 with 17 overs remaining</m11>. Even in conditions that had been refreshingly inviting for bowlers, it was an equation within Canada's reach, but Pakistan's jack-in-the-box captain sprung to life to wipe out the lower and middle order. #p#<m12>It was Saeed Ajmal, back in the side in place of Abdur Rehman, who started the collapse when he dismissed the obdurate Zubin Surkari lbw. The appeal was initially denied by umpire Daryl Harper, but the much-maligned DRS proved the bowler right. It was one of a number of decisions that Harper had to reverse as, in a single innings, the merits of umpire technology were given a perfect advertisement.</m12> #p#<m13>Surkari's dismissal</m13> <m14>brought the destructive Rizwan Cheema to the crease</m14> and with the target still in sight it seemed scripted that Cheema would bash his adopted country to glory against the land of his birth, but after starting with a bang over midwicket <m15>he ended with a whimper - missing an Afridi googly to lose his off bail</m15>. #p#Smart stats. <m16>Shahid Afridi has become the first bowler to take three four-wicket hauls</m16> in a single World Cup. He is also the fourth bowler to take two five-fors in one World Cup. The two best bowling performances by a Pakistan player in World Cups belong to Afridi, and they've come within ten days of each other. Afridi is the leading wicket-taker in this World Cup with 14, and needs only four more to equal the record for most wickets by a Pakistan bowler in a World Cup: Wasim Akram took 18 in 1992. It is only the ninth instance of a bowler taking at least four wickets in three consecutive ODI innings. Waqar Younis achieved this feat on three separate occasions. Canada's 15-over scores in their three matches have been the three lowest among all teams in this tournament - they scored 35 for 3 against Zimbabwe, 36 for 3 against Sri Lanka, and <m17>40 for 2 today against Pakistan</m17>. #p#<m18>Afridi's next over all but sealed the match with a slider rushing through Jimmy Hansra's defences.</m18> Hansra had played with the sort of calculated daring that underpinned Ireland's success in Bangalore but could not last long enough. <m19>Afridi was aloft in celebration a ball later when he bowled Harvir Baidwan to set up a hat-trick delivery.</m19> Though he didn't get it, <m20>he sealed his five-wicket haul when Wahab Riaz held a Tyson Gordon skier.</m20> #p#<m21>As if to emphasise his hold on the occasion Afridi even managed to conjure another scalp after finishing his bowling stint, hitting direct from mid-on to catch the wheezing Balaji Rao short.</m21> It meant Pakistan finished a game with all the zest that was missing from a forgettable batting display. #p#Were it not for <m22>a stodgy 73-run stand between Misbah-ul-Haq and Umar Akmal</m22>, Pakistan may well have joined England on the receiving end of a World Cup shock. Before they came together <m23>Pakistan were rocking at 67 for 4</m23> and <m24>lost five wickets for 44 after their stand was broken</m24>. Misbah was as calm as ever and nursed his more volatile partner through <m25>an organised, pragmatic and thoroughly un-Pakistani partnership.</m25> #p#Either side of that pair it was a overconfident display as the batsmen lacked the intensity to buckle down and keep the scoreboard moving in the face of an energetic Canada effort. Using the heavy atmosphere and sporting pitch, all the Canadian bowlers caused trouble but it was the contrasting aggression of seamer Baidwan and rotund legspinner Rao who starred, constantly prodding and probing the Pakistan batsmen who were unable to raise their games. #p#It left Canada dreaming at the half-way stage, but Afridi intervened when his team needed him most. #p#Match Timeline

Overcast conditions, empty-ish stadium, Pakistan batting first, a minnow on the other side. Ireland anyone? #p#The over. Whether or not Harvir Singh Baidwan comes across such conditions often in Canada is not known first, but there could not have been a better use of them. <m4>From the very first over, in which snared Ahmed Shehzad</m4>, he hit the perfect length, allowing the ball to nibble this way and that like he was a Kiwi medium-pacer from the 1992 World Cup. <m5>The highlight was his fifth over, a maiden</m5>, so constrictive it could've been the hangman's noose, with <m6>one surprise bouncer right at Umar Akmal's throat</m6>, also slipped in. Deserved a wicket, but <m7>he got three anyway</m7>. #p#The Powerplay.

There are worse things to do in life than watch the, ahem, generously waist-lined Balaji Rao stroll in to bowl his leggies. Rao is one of cricket's many 'coulda been a contenders'. <m12>He bowled a nice spell as well, ripping the ball on occasion and giving it some air for two deserved wickets</m12>. <m13>But his finest moment came at slip, when Wahab Riaz edged Jimmy Hansra. Rao took it, watched it slip out, tried to grab it a few times thereafter before somehow he pouched it between his not inconsiderably-sized thighs.</m13> #p#The System. Like any self-respecting celebrity, the DRS has rarely strayed away from the headlines in this tournament. With the BCCI it has enjoyed a particularly torrid hate-hate affair. But in Canada's response its utility was there for all to see, especially with Daryl Harper and Nigel Llong in the midst of a shaky spell. <m14>First Pakistan reviewed a leg-before decision Harper turned down from Umar Gul, one which even from behind Ravindu Gunasekera looked full enough to be not pitching outside leg.</m14> <m15>Kumar was then given out leg-before next over by Llong though the ball looked high: on referral it was, comfortably.</m15> <m16>In the eighth over, Harper again gave Ashish Bagai out to a ball that looked without replays to be hitting the stumps only if they were a foot higher.</m16> <m17>Bagai was reprieved by Harper eventually in the 18th over only to find, as it appeared to the naked eye, that he was pretty plumb. On referral, he was duly given.</m17> Just for good measure, Harper had another decision overturned later. When the umpire is having a shocker, is the answer to the question, what use is the DRS?
17	504147	Canada v Pakistan, Group A, World Cup 2011, Colombo	Bagai says Canada's plans failed	Osman Samiuddin at the Premadasa Stadium	March 3, 2011	#p#The status of Wayne Gretzky as the most famous Canadian sportsman of all time would not really have been threatened by Ashish Bagai and his men had they pulled off an Irish - to use the current slang - but dear Lord it would have made them famous. For 83 overs, they threatened a result that would have surpassed even Kevin O'Brien's heroics on Wednesday night in Bangalore for shock value; one that would not have been dissimilar to Ireland's other big World Cup win, three years and 50 weeks ago. #p#The instant Shahid Afridi won the toss and chose to bat, under dirty grey skies on a dirty brown surface, Jamaica '07 entered the room. It was a good toss to lose, Bagai said later, the groundsman having told him it was a bowl-first wicket. And Canada were tremendous, more so given <m1>they lost a frontline bowler in Khurram Chohan early</m1>. The spirit of Ireland and Bangalore was still floating around in the morning, Bagai said. "It gave us all a little belief in the morning." #p#At the centre was a quite outstanding spell of precisely the kind of right-arm medium dibbly-dobblers that so often trumps a top side in these conditions. Harvir Baidwan has a reputation for taking wickets and you can kind of see why; his pace is seductively friendly and the lengths are generally full so that batsmen will take chances. <m2>Ahmed Shehzad fell for it</m2>, and <m3>Younis Khan was duped by a lovely curving ball</m3>. Two overs to Umar Akmal and Misbah-ul-Haq deserved much more than just one maiden. #p#Harvir Baidwan's dibbly-dobblers posed serious problems for Pakistan's batsmen in the conditions. AFP Enlarge #p#There was support as well: a lovely hand from the podgy Balaji Rao, who put in a pleasing, unhurried spell of legspin; Rizwan Cheema and Jimmy Hansra more than chipped in as well, leaving their captain satisfied with the overall effort in the field. "<m4>Keeping them to 184 on that wicket</m4> was a tremendous effort especially <m5>after losing one of our key bowlers in the first couple of overs</m5>. The six bowlers did a fantastic job and it was a decent fielding effort." #p#Canada's problems lie most squarely with their batting. They've now scored 122, 123 and 132 in three games. And it's been fragile enough to sense that even when <m6>they were sneaking along at 104 for 3 in the 34th</m6>, one wicket could change the game. Until then Zubin Surkari and Jimmy Hansra had been just the men for the job, chancing it and milking it. When Ireland took off in pursuit of 133 in Jamaica, though, and even on Wednsesay night, despite losing wickets, there remained a robustness and calm about them that, to the disappointment of Bagai, was absent in Canada's performance in Colombo. #p#"The wicket was getting better and better which is very unusual for this wicket. The game plan was to just be positive and because the batting has been a worry, we said we would just play our natural games. A couple of youngsters opened the batting and we said play your natural games and the same for the rest of us. We had a decent partnership in the middle, a couple of good ones, but Shahid [Afridi] came on and he was the difference between the two teams. Our batting worries continue. It's very disappointing because I thought we had a good chance of putting in a shock performance and getting back on track but that wasn't to be." #p#Afridi, especially, looked as if he might pose fatal problems; his bowling is, these days, a handful against most sides but against the Associates he is an entire truckload of trouble. There was a plan in place, Bagai said; the kind sides put out against Muttiah Muralitharan, but plans look best on paper. "We're very disappointed one guy ran through the batting order. We started off with the approach of trying to milk him for 30 to 35 runs, but once he gets wickets he gets right on top of you and he gets very confident. He gets his variations going and then it gets harder and harder and we were just not good enough today." #p#They weren't, but only just. "That's sport, that's cricket, you've got to pick yourself up. At the end of the day it is sport," Bagai said. It can be a cruel one.
17	504164	Canada v Pakistan, Group A, World Cup 2011, Colombo	Pakistan's defensive tactics almost cost them	Osman Samiuddin at the Premadasa Stadium	March 3, 2011	#p#Pakistan dodged a bullet, for which there will be some relief. That the bullet came from a gun they were pointing at their own head will bring only resignation and bemusement. It is what they do every now and again, though it must be said they don't usually miss. John Davison spoke before the match of Pakistan being the kind of side that has a "poor day" very often; he spoke only fact. Against Pakistan, Associates can always dream. #p#Pakistan played as if spooked by a ghost. Shahid Afridi admitted that the defeat to Ireland four years ago - which he missed because of a ban - flashed through his mind when Canada were batting. "I told my boys that we must play for a win, to not be negative, we will win this game, work hard and don't worry about the result," he said. #p#Predominantly the batting was poor, wracked by nerves and unclear thinking. In any case, Pakistan, despite three wins, have been overcautious in this tournament, playing a line-up that bats till eight; if seven haven't scored, it's very rare the eighth will, yet they persist with an approach that, traditionally, suits them as well as the sun does vampires. #p#The clouds and pitch at the Premadasa were doing a little bit, so panicked shot selection was inevitable, something Afridi realised would not cut it against better teams. "There was poor shot selection and it was a very poor batting performance. If we want to play good cricket against good teams then we must improve. It's a good wake-up call for us." #p#Shahid Afridi has taken 14 of the 29 wickets Pakistan have taken in the World Cup so far. Associated Press Enlarge #p#A third failure for the openers Ahmed Shehzad and Mohammad Hafeez will be taken all the more seriously given that two of the games have been against Associate sides. Afridi, though, was more critical of the middle order. "We had a very good opportunity for me, for Abdul Razzaq, for Misbah-ul-Haq and Umar Akmal to carry on batting; we could have scored more runs but we didn't. We need a good start. #p#"The condition of the pitch was such that we needed to bat with patience. It was a totally different pitch and the sun didn't come out. There were clouds and the ball was stopping so there was a need to wait while batting and we couldn't do that. If we had spent time at the wicket runs would have come." #p#But where was the sense in not taking <m1>the batting Powerplay</m1> <m2>when Misbah-ul-Haq and Umar Akmal were set</m2>, or <m3>when Afridi and Abdul Razzaq were together</m3>? In no scenario can it be right to <m4>take the Powerplay</m4> <m5>when Umar Gul and Saeed Ajmal are at the crease</m5>. It appears that Pakistan plan beforehand to take it <m6>after the 40th over</m6> and don't readily budge from that plan, no matter what the situation of the innings. #p#To see no slip to the possibility of a Saeed Ajmal doosra when Canada chased, or as many as five men on the boundary when they were eight down, only completed the picture of a quite unnecessary defensiveness. The team's plan was to bowl "maiden overs, so that their required rate goes higher," Afridi said, and you can see some smidgeon of logic in that. But against Canada? and when you've only got <m7>184 to defend</m7>? #p#<m8>Afridi's bowling</m8>, at least, was much sharper than some of the moves he made as captain, and <m9>a second five-wicket haul</m9> in three games keeps him comfortably in the leading wicket-taker's spot in the tournament so far. With 14, he has taken nearly half of all Pakistan's wickets in three games. #p#Conditions, he acknowledged, are ideal for his fastish spinners. "I try to bowl wicket to wicket and I get spin on these pitches where it skids, so I'm getting wickets. The conditions are very good: perfect for spinners but also good for fast bowlers if you hit the right areas." #p#If there was a system to Pakistan's performances, then it would have been tempting to conclude that they have gotten a shocker out of it early, without any real damage in the long run. If they haven't done that yet, they have at least put themselves on the verge of a quarter-final place.
17	504233	Canada v Pakistan, Group A, World Cup 2011, Colombo	Canada 'boggled' by DRS decisions	Osman Samiuddin at the Premadasa Stadium	March 4, 2011	The DRS was relied on heavily during the Canada-Pakistan game. AFP Enlarge Related Links Sambit Bal : Grey is the colour of the DRS. News : ICC criticism of Dhoni out of line - India. News : Dhoni angered by UDRS ruling. In Focus: Technology in cricket. Matches: Canada v Pakistan at Colombo (RPS) Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Canada | Pakistan #p#Ashish Bagai, the Canada captain, was "boggled" by some of the decisions made by the DRS (Decision Review System) in <m1>his side's tense 43-run loss to Pakistan at the Premadasa on Thursday</m1>. Bagai experienced the best and worst of the system; <m2>reprieved once after being given out</m2> and <m3>sent back later after being given not out</m3>. #p#<m4>Those two calls</m4> were part of <m5>a total of five referrals in Canada's chase</m5> in which the on-field umpires' decisions were eventually reversed. <m6>Bagai was first given out leg-before to Umar Gul in the 8th over. He asked for a referral - prompted by signals from the dressing room to do so, which was spotted by Pakistani fielders - before replays showed the ball to be going comfortably over leg-stump.</m6> <m7>Later, he was given not out by Daryl Harper off Shahid Afridi on another leg-before shout, only for Pakistan to refer the decision and be awarded.</m7> #p#<m8>Three other decisions, against Ravindu Gunasekera and Zubin Surkari, also prompted decision-changing referrals, rounding off a bad day at the office for Harper and Nigel Llong.</m8> Bagai was asked about the decisions and indicated his displeasure with the system. "I'm not sure I can answer that before I speak with the umpires today," said Bagai. "There was a bit of controversy over the use of it. Some go your way, some don't. They've [ICC] kept a mantra of relying on technology blindly and that is their decision. We got a couple today that we were boggled with but that's what they've chosen, we can't do anything about that now." #p#Pakistan's own experiences with the DRS have been hit and miss. Against Sri Lanka last week, they wasted two reviews in the field on decisions that, to the naked eye, seemed not out, including one for an edge. But Afridi insisted there were benefits from its use. "I think it is good because one decision can change the match, a not out or an out," he said. #p#Perhaps flippantly, he added, "it should be there and I think the number of referrals allowed should be raised to four from two, because two are not proving enough." #p#In the wake of the Ian Bell incident in the Bangalore tie with India, much of the focus has been on one particular clause of the system, the 2.5m rule. Earlier in the tournament, however, Mahela Jayawardene had raised the issue of the capacity of a DRS without Hot Spot technology. During his opening game century in Hambantota, against Canada incidentally, Jayawardene survived two appeals and fielding referrals for caught-behind decisions, when slo-mo cameras couldn't provide a definitive assessment. #p#The same concern was raised by Ricky Ponting ahead of Saturday's clash with Sri Lanka at the Premadasa, though Ponting did give broad support to technology. "I was a bit surprised at the start of the tournament when we found out we were using the DRS without Hot Spot, that was a bit of a shock to me because Hot Spot part of it is probably as big a part of the system as anything," Ponting said. #p#"At the end of the day, players always have to understand that it's not going to be perfect. But we're still going to be getting more correct decisions at the end of a game, which is obviously beneficial for the game. It's like it's been used in Test cricket, you can walk off at the end of the day and feel you've been aggrieved by a couple of decisions that have gone either for you or against you in that game, but as long as you're getting more correct decisions then it's got to be good for the game."
18	504107	New Zealand v Zimbabwe, Group A, World cup 2011, Ahmedabad	A match vital to quarter-final aspirations	The Preview by George Binoy	March 3, 2011	#p#Match Facts #p#March 4, Ahmedabad Start time 09.30 local time (0400 GMT) #p#Tatenda Taibu examines his bats on the eve of Zimbabwe's best chance of making the quarter-final AFP Enlarge Related Links Matches: New Zealand v Zimbabwe at Ahmedabad Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: New Zealand | Zimbabwe #p#The Big Picture #p#The World Cup so far has been a tale of two groups. The teams comprising Group B have played five entertaining matches, bringing the tournament alive and adding intrigue. Group A, on the other hand, has been soporific, filled with one-sided contests decided early in the piece. It's crying out for some life, some drama. On Wednesday, two of its more nuggety teams will attempt to give it some at Motera. #p#New Zealand and Zimbabwe are ranked fourth and fifth in Group A. The first three teams, in all probability, are quarterfinal certainties. The last two don't have a prayer. New Zealand and Zimbabwe are level on points with one victory and one defeat each, separated only by net run-rate. Though Daniel Vettori's men will go into Friday's game as favourites - only because the majority doesn't fancy an upset - this is Zimbabwe's best chance. Floor New Zealand tomorrow and a knockout berth is tangible, with the hapless Kenyans in store. Lose, and the dream of qualification all but goes up in smoke. #p#The situation is similar for New Zealand as well, for they have been in wretched form against tough opponents. Beating Zimbabwe - as they are expected to - will leave them needing, in all probability, only one more victory with a game against Canada in hand. Slip, and they'll have to beat either Sri Lanka or Pakistan to make it past the group stage. New Zealand's quarter-final qualification would have either got much easier, or that much harder by this time tomorrow evening. #p#Form guide (completed matches, most recent first) #p#New Zealand : LWWLL Zimbabwe : WLLLL #p#Watch out for... #p#In Ray Price, Prosper Utseya and Graeme Cremer, Zimbabwe possess a slow-bowling attack capable of containing most batsmen, especially if the conditions are to their liking. They had Australia's top-order on a leash for the first half of their innings. That performance was at Motera as well. Price, if tested strategies are used, will bowl darts with the new ball. Martin Guptill, New Zealand's opener, is less at ease against spin. Will New Zealand give Brendon McCullum a new partner tomorrow? Their other batsmen, however, also prefer the ball coming on at pace. They are unlikely to get it. Zimbabwe's spinners will be New Zealand's banana skin, and they'll have to tread on it for a considerable period of time. How much assistance will New Zealand's bowling coach Allan Donald, who spent time coaching in Zimbabwe last year, be to their batsmen? #p#How long has it been since Ross Taylor entertained audiences with an innings filled with those pulls and slog-sweeps that dropped jaws? New Zealand would dearly love that blast from the past, but they will also settle for an unspectacular, calm and unifying innings from him. In theory, Taylor is New Zealand's most capable top-order batsman but evidence of that has been scarce in recent months. If they are to go far, or even just a step further, in this World Cup, Taylor will need to be substantial. #p#Team news #p#Chris Mpofu, Zimbabwe's new-ball bowler, was suffering from a side strain and did not train on Wednesday. He did train on Thursday, though, and is set to play. Charles Coventry failed in the first two matches and Terry Duffin is a replacement option, but Zimbabwe are unlikely to use him. #p#Zimbabwe (probable): 1 Brendan Taylor (wk), 2 Charles Coventry, 3 Tatenda Taibu, 4 Craig Ervine, 5 Elton Chigumbura (capt), 6 Sean Williams, 7 Greg Lamb, 8 Proper Utseya, 9 Graeme Cremer, 10 Ray Price, 11 Chris Mpofu. #p#New Zealand's selection of Jamie How, a specialist opener, against Australia and then batting him at No. 7 as an insurance policy against the battery of fast bowlers, was questioned and criticised in the media. Especially when Jacob Oram was fit. Given that New Zealand will be tested by spin this time, will they retain How in the XI? The other question is whether Kyle Mills will play, and if so instead of whom? James Franklin failed at No. 5 against Australia and barely bowled. Hamish Bennett conceded 63 in seven overs but took two of the only three wickets to fall. #p#New Zealand (probable): 1 Martin Guptill, 2 Brendon McCullum (wk), 3 Jesse Ryder, 4 Ross Taylor, 5 James Franklin, 6 Scott Styris, 7 Jacob Oram, 8 Nathan McCullum, 9 Daniel Vettori, 10 Tim Southee, 11 Hamish Bennett. #p#Pitch and conditions #p#The Motera pitch is likely to be slow and similar to the one that was used for the Zimbabwe-Australia game. The temperature in Ahmedabad will rise steadily as the day progresses. #p#Stats and trivia #p#New Zealand played Zimbabwe last in an ODI in August 2005. They won that by 27 runs. They lead the head-to-head record between the countries 19-7 with one tie and one no result. #p#Since New Zealand's one-day form begun to slump in August 2010, Taylor has averaged 24.73 in 17 innnings, with only three half-centuries and nine single-digit scores. #p#Price, Utseya and Cremer bowled a total of 96 dot balls in 30 overs against Australia, who were able to relieve pressure by hitting occasional boundaries later in the innings. New Zealand might have to protect against a succession of dot balls. #p#Quotes #p#"This is a must-win game for us on where we go in the tournament. Zimbabwe have played pretty well. We have seen a different set of tactics. Against Australia it was pace, we would see a lot of spin in this game." Daniel Vettori is aware of what lies ahead for his batsmen. #p#"It is the most important game for us tomorrow to put us in the running [for the quarter-finals]. The guys have prepared well and hopefully we will bring the positives from the last game into tomorrow's game." Elton Chigumbura , Zimbabwe's captain, knows how important this game is.

They started by making light work of a timid batting line-up, <m11>Tim Southee picking up 3 for 29</m11> as four of the top seven failed to reach double figures and <m12>Zimbabwe limped to 162</m12>. <m13>Martin Guptill and Brendon McCullum then sealed the result with the highest opening stand of this tournament</m13> and New Zealand's best in World Cups, as <m14>the target was overhauled with more than 16 overs to spare</m14>. #p#New Zealand went into this game level on points with Zimbabwe, the teams ranked fourth and fifth in Group A with one victory and one defeat each and separated only by net run-rate. <m15>Beating Zimbabwe, especially considering the sheer scale of their win</m15>, means that, in all probability they will need only one more victory to book a place in the quarterfinals, with a game against Canada in hand. #p#Zimbabwe talked themselves into a corner before this game, letting anyone who would listen know that they were targeting New Zealand in a must-win match. Their words seemed to build more pressure on themselves than the opposition, however, and the batsmen froze under the weight of expectation to reach a challenging total after captain Elton Chigumbura won the toss and decided to bat. #p#<m16>The rot started as early as the second over for Zimbabwe, Charles Coventry setting off for a non-existent single to the second ball he faced and not even bothering to dive as Hamish Bennett's throw from mid-on hit the stumps directly.</m16> New Zealand looked like the more inspired team from the start, maintaining intensity and energy with the ball and in the field, and <m17>they soon had Zimbabwe in even deeper trouble when Tim Southee recovered from the disappointment of having Tatenda Taibu dropped at mid-off to pin him in front of middle and leg with his very next ball</m17> to reduce them to <m18>27 for 2 in the eighth over</m18>. #p#Some inventive captaincy from Vettori was backed up by his bowlers' discipline, <m19>Craig Ervine falling to a well thought-out off-side trap</m19>, and <m20>Vettori also took no time to win the battle with his opposite number, dismissing Chigumbura with his first ball of the match.</m20> <m21>He added another scalp in the same over, Regis Chakabva flapping haplessly to slip</m21> as <m22>Zimbabwe slid to 46 for 5 in the 15th over</m22>. All the while <m23>Brendan Taylor had looked like his team's most composed batsman, cracking four boundaries to enter the 40s</m23> and keep Zimbabwe afloat. <m24>When he missed a full, straight delivery from Scott Styris to be out for 44</m24> their hopes of setting a challenging total had all but evaporated. #p#Graeme Cremer and Prosper Utseya's stubborn rearguard was ended <m25>when Mills found the edge of Cremer's bat for 22</m25>, but <m26>Ray Price did at least manage to stick around long enough to help Utseya take the score past 150</m26>. <m27>Southee, who found appreciable reverse swing with a scuffed up old ball, swung one into Price's pads to remove him for 11</m27> and <m28>two overs later rattled Utseya's stumps with another inswinging delivery to end the innings</m28>. #p#Smart stats. This is <m29>New Zealand's sixth ten-wicket win</m29> in ODIs, and their second in World Cups. Their first one was against Kenya in their opening game of this tournament. It's <m30>Zimbabwe's second ten-wicket defeat in World Cups</m30> - their first one was in 1983 against West Indies. <m31>The 166-run partnership between Martin Guptill and Brendon McCullum</m31> is New Zealand's fourth-highest for the opening wicket in ODIs, and their highest in World Cups. <m32>It's only their fourth century stand for the first wicket</m32> in World Cups. Guptill and McCullum have an average of 51.38 per completed partnership for the opening wicket in ODIs. Among pairs who've scored more than 500 runs for New Zealand, only two have a higher average. Before this knock, McCullum had gone 12 innings without getting a half-century, averaging 17.54 during that period. In 46 ODIs against the top nine teams since the beginning of 2008, Zimbabwe have been five down for less than 50 nine times, and lost half their side for less than 100 on 22 occasions. #p#Guptill and McCullum's plan appeared to be to deny Zimbabwe's slow bowlers any early breakthroughs through utmost caution and attack the seamers on a placid pitch. Without a decent total on the board, Zimbabwe's spinners were unable to create any pressure to force a breakthrough, and both batsmen simply waited for the bad ball to put away. #p#<m33>Guptill started in a hurry against Tinashe Panyangara, smashing 14 off from his first six balls</m33> and lofting <m34>two imperious sixes as his first three overs were dispatched for 25</m34>. In comparison, <m35>Price's first three yielded just nine, with barely a shot played</m35>. #p#Whatever pressure there might have been at the start of New Zealand's chase - and if there was any, it was minimal - quickly dissipated and even though the spinners maintained generally tight lines, the docile pitch meant there were few alarms for the batsmen. <m36>New Zealand eased past fifty in the 12th over</m36> with a brace of boundaries off Price and after he had been seen off, with both batsmen settling in, offspinners Utseya and Greg Lamb were easily milked. #p#With his options severely limited by the under-par total, Chigumbura simply ran out of ideas and the white flag was waved when the field was set back to allow easy singles on both sides of the wicket. <m37>Guptill, who proved the more aggressive of the two, punched one into the covers to bring up a 68-ball half-century in the 22nd over</m37> and <m38>the batsmen barely broke a sweat in bringing the 100 up shortly afterwards</m38>. #p#The match was practically over as a contest at that point and Zimbabwe simply went through the motions as the runs continued to flow, <m39>21 runs from Elton Chigumbura's three overs</m39> hastening the end. <m40>McCullum reached his own half-century, from 74 balls</m40>, and <m41>New Zealand cantered home in the 34th over</m41> in a flurry of boundaries. #p#While New Zealand could not have asked for a better team performance, a fighting defeat might at least have spurred the Zimbabweans on to believe they could still take down Sri Lanka or Pakistan. The nature of their capitulation will have sapped the morale from their campaign, however, and they will do well to follow Chigumbura's advice after he said he hoped his side would forget the defeat quickly and move on. #p#Match Timeline

Matches: New Zealand v Zimbabwe at Ahmedabad Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: New Zealand | Zimbabwe #p#Bennett's Jonty Rhodes moment. <m2>Charles Coventry had moved forward in an ungainly fashion to nudge Tim Southee towards mid-on. An alert Hamish Benett had already taken a start and then noticed Coventry, already late off the blocks, had run in the path of Southee, giving the fielder that extra second. Bennett picked the ball swiftly and then dived forward to throw underarm at the stumps. The eye-catching thing was the angle, which was tight and Bennett could only see one stump. Coventry tried hard to recover ground, throwing himself forward to make the crease but Bennett's throw was accurate and beat him by a whisker.</m1> #p#The fly-scoop? <m3>Southee surprised Taylor with a short delivery that climbed on him too quick. Taylor was attentive to the length and had moved back quickly to leave the ball. But when it rushed on to him, he improvised equally swiftly by tilting the bat - which was lying dead horizontally - a little skywards, resembling more a scoop than a cut to fetch a four past fine leg.</m3> Perhaps we could call it the 'fly-scoop', though suggestions are welcome. #p#Shot of the day. Quite often batting strokes stay etched in the mind mainly due of the follow-through. Think Gavaskar's straight drive. Lara's rasping cut or slicing cover drive; Tendulkar's backfoot punch; Dravid's cover drive. <m4>Today Martin Guptill sighted a length ball quickly from Tinashe Panyangara, and lofted it over the bowler's head for the first six of the match.

18	504275	New Zealand v Zimbabwe, World Cup 2011, Group A, Ahmedabad	Vettori lauds 'perfect' day	Nagraj Gollapudi in Ahmedabad	March 4, 2011	#p#Days like these have become a rarity for New Zealand. A disciplined line from their new-ball pair of Kyle Mills and Tim Southee, an agile and pro-active fielding unit that forced two spectacular run-outs, rounded off by controlled yet aggressive batting from the openers made New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori call it a "perfect" day. #p#"I am not sure if you can ask for too much more - we wanted a complete performance out of ourselves and right from the start we put it together. <m1>To dismiss a good Zimbabwe line-up for 160 on a very good (batting) wicket</m1> and then <m2>chase it with ten wickets in hand</m2>, I can't really ask too much more from the guys," Vettori said, describing his feelings after New Zealand became the only team this World Cup to <m3>win by a ten-wicket margin</m3> twice. #p#In their tournament opener, Brendon McCullum and Martin Guptill had dashed to the target of 70 in 37 minutes as New Zealand demolished Kenya in Chennai. But that was followed by a below-par performance against arch-rivals Australia five days later, where none of the New Zealand batsmen got a start and the bowlers found it hard to defend 206, with the defending champions registering a seven-wicket victory. #p#New Zealand had arrived on the back of a 2-3 series loss to Pakistan at home. They had also lost 18 of their previous 29 matches from the beginning of last year. That involved series whitewashes in Bangladesh and then India. The big worry was the constant failures of the batsmen to raise a platform. After Ireland's improbable victory against England, New Zealand were wary of Zimbabwe, who have won matches against higher-ranked teams in the last one year including India and Sri Lanka. "There was a little bit of pressure around the game. It was a must-win game," Vettori admitted about the mindset at the start of the match. #p#New Zealand were aggressive in all departments against Zimbabwe in Ahmedabad. Getty Images Enlarge #p#But <m4>Hamish Bennett's spectacular dive to run out Charles Coventry in the second over of the morning triggered a quick downfall</m4>, and even before the first hour was over, Zimbabwe were in dire straits. If not for the 87 runs gathered by Nos 7 to 10, Elton Chigumbara's men could've faced the same assault that West Indies inflicted on Bangladesh in Dhaka later in the afternoon. "It is hard to bounce back from there," Vettori said of <m5>Zimbabwe's plight at 46 for 5 after 15 overs.</m5> "If you can get those initial breakthroughs you can put a lot of pressure on the team. Then you can set attacking fields which makes it difficult for the opposition. We were fortunate to take those early wickets through great seam bowling, some very good fielding which made my job and the rest of the bowlers' a lot easier." #p#Vettori was also glad that <m6>the McCullum-Guptill combination had played sensibly to bolster New Zealand's confidence</m6> ahead of marquee contests against Pakistan next week and later Sri Lanka, two teams New Zealand has struggled badly against recently. <m7>Their unbeaten partnership today</m7> was the highest by a New Zealand opening pair in a World Cup and eighth overall. #p#Vettori said the influence of John Wright cannot be forgotten. Wright took over as New Zealand coach from the Pakistan series and has been blunt in his appraisals of batsmen ever since. During training here he has worked hard having one-on-one sessions. Yesterday Ross Taylor said that Wright had made it clear to the batsmen in a closed-door meeting that they had to step up as a group and not individually. Vettori said the openers' success proved the players were understanding the Wright way. "What we did with the ball allowed Brendon and Martin to take their time, get themselves in and really produce innings of timing and quality. They still played their natural games. There was no need to score at any pace. It was a good controlled innings and we got on top quite early."
18	504308	New Zealand v Zimbabwe, World Cup 2011, Group A, Ahmedabad	Familiar failings for Zimbabwe	Nagraj Gollapudi in Ahmedabad	March 4, 2011	#p#Such a toothless batting performance by Zimbabwe. Should the ICC see fit to approve a qualifying tournament for the 2015 World Cup, on this evidence Zimbabwe will be hard pressed to make it through to the main event. #p#Take a glance at the modes of dismissal: <m1>Charles Coventry wastes his wicket with indecision leading to a run out in only the second over</m1>, <m2>Tatenda Taibu spoons a catch and gets a reprieve</m2> but <m3>the very next ball has plays across an inswinger</m3>, <m4>Craig Ervine then slashes into the hands of deep point against a short and wide delivery knowing there were four men patrolling the off side</m4>, <m5>Elton Chigumbara, gets into a tangle against Daniel Vettori</m5> and <m6>next ball Regis Chakabva edges a wide delivery to slip</m6>. #p#It was a perfect batting pitch, on which Vettori thought 300 was possible. Zimbabwe knew it was a must-win game to entertain hopes of a quarter-final berth. They went into the game saying it was the most important match. They elected to bat. Then they went on to make mistakes they should not even commit in the nets. #p#The easy conclusion to come to is that Zimbabwe have not improved much despite all the positive talk of recent times. Yet that isn't the case. It is easy to forget that most players in the squad are inexperienced. Many were thrown into deep and treacherous water by the administrators immediately after the rebels' protest during the 2003 World Cup, which led to the disintegration of the squad that had been built over a longer period of time. #p#<m7>Brendan Taylor top-scored for Zimbabwe with 44</m7> but that sort of application was sadly lacking elsewhere. Getty Images Enlarge #p#Though there are quite a few players in the present squad who played in the Caribbean in 2007, most were, and are still, ill-equipped to deal with the pressures of international cricket. Only the likes of Taibu, Chigumbara, Taylor, Prosper Utseya and Ray Price have played against top-level opponents and kept their head on something approaching a regular basis. #p#Part of the problem is a lack of exposure as Zimbabwe have barely played top sides in the past few years and most of their success has had to come against Associates. When they visited Bangladesh late last year, a side they needed to compete against to show their development, they lost 3-1. Since May 2007, Zimbabwe have not won an ODI series against any major opponent, only beating Kenya and Ireland. #p#Their most notable performance against higher-ranked countries was to enter the final of the tri-series at home in 2010, but even if those were second-string sides from India and Sri Lanka, there was an important lesson there. Zimbabwe dared and made the final. But they blinked when the big moment arrived. It was the same when they pushed South Africa to the brink in two Twenty20 internationals then failed at the last hurdle. That trend has not changed much. Against Canada, last week, they were struggling at 7 for 2 with both their openers out yet they won the match by a 175-run margin. #p#"It is always hard against a bigger team. We had lost two wickets against Canada but we recovered," Chigumbara said. "It is very disappointing. The way we started with our batting - it is always hard to come back from losing three to four quick wickets in the first 15 overs. Today it was more about the technical errors." #p#Unfortunately Chigumbara's words seem to be falling on deaf ears. On Wednesday, he abruptly stopped training and had a loud message for the batsmen who were split into two sets nets. One set was facing the quick bowlers while the other was lined up against spinners on a worn pitch and Chigumbara had been watching the batsmen play casually. "I was telling them if the wicket is not playing proper make sure you apply yourselves. There is no point getting out three or four times [in the nets] as then you are doing nothing. [In the matches] most guys have got 10 runs and get out. But if they get their eye in, they are capable of scoring." #p#Seen in isolation, Zimbabwe batsmen played like amateurs today. Yet in the big picture, Zimbabwe have actually improved between the World Cups. And that only makes <m8>this defeat</m8> more painful.

Bangladesh and West Indies know a place in the quarter-finals is there for the taking, especially in light of England's struggles to impose themselves on the tournament. But with Ireland on the march after their epic triumph on Wednesday night, there's suddenly a sixth competitor waiting to pounce on the next team to blink. #p#Bangladesh enter this contest on a tide of popular acclaim. The manner in which they overcame the Irish in Mirpur last week has reinforced the belief that in their favoured home conditions, with a quartet of canny spinners to take advantage of their slow, low surfaces, they are quite capable of holding their own against teams with superior credentials - let alone a team such as West Indies who are below them in the world rankings. That Ireland were able to saunter past 327 against England in Bangalore, yet flounder in pursuit of 206 in Bangladesh, will serve as a warning to West Indies' power-hitters. Unless someone does a Sehwag - and no prizes for guessing the likeliest candidates - this one could be another war of attrition. #p#That's not to say that West Indies do not have the skill or patience to overcome the conditions. Chris Gayle's diligent 110-ball 80 against the Netherlands was an atypical performance from such an explosive player, but it mirrored almost perfectly Tamim Iqbal's 86-ball 70 in Bangladesh's opening defeat against India. It's almost as though the two men had primed themselves for a controlled explosion at a later date, and just as Tamim's 44 made the difference against Ireland, the winner of their head-to-head tussle could well propel the destiny of the match. #p#Realistically, this one is too close to call. Both teams have begun with a win and a loss apiece, but if West Indies' dispatching of the Netherlands was eye-catchingly comprehensive, with Kemar Roach's hat-trick setting the seal on an excellent day's work, Bangladesh's self-belief in their out-muscling of Ireland was no less impressive. Strength in adversity has rarely been Bangladesh's strong-point, but right from the moment Mohammad Ashraful reduced the Irish to 75 for 3 in the 19th over, their body language was that of a team that knew it would win. In a tussle between two teams ranked eighth and ninth in the world, such displays of belief will be critical. #p#Form guide (completed matches, most recent first) Bangladesh WLWWW West Indies WLLLL #p#Watch out for... #p#Bangladesh's captain, Shakib Al Hasan , is a combative cricketer and a top-notch left-arm spinner. With his unwavering accuracy and subtle variations in flight and bite, he is capable of rattling through his overs almost before a batsman has a chance to react, and no-one in the Bangladesh team is better equipped to turn the screw if West Indies allow themselves to lose momentum in the middle overs. With the bat he has looked in form without kicking on to a big one. There's no time like the present to restate his credentials as the world's leading allrounder in ODI cricket. #p#It's hard to look beyond Chris Gayle for West Indian inspiration in this fixture. As Virender Sehwag showed for India in the tournament opener, massive totals are possible at Mirpur if a batsman is willing to put his weight through every shot. His darting offspin might be of equal value, however. He rarely looks as though he's trying with the ball, as he plods in off two paces and spears each delivery straight into the blockhole. But the slower they arrive, the slower they tend to be dispatched in Bangladesh. #p#Team news #p#Bangladesh have named their twelve: the XI that played in the last game, plus the offspinner Mahmudullah, who made way for Mohammad Ashraful in the Ireland game. A recall is conceivable, though it would be tough on either Naeem Islam, whose tidy spell backed up a vital 29, or Ashraful, whose de facto role as an on-field mascot got the Mirpur crowd right behind the team early in the contest. #p#Bangladesh (probable) 1 Tamim Iqbal, 2 Imrul Kayes, 3 Junaid Siddique, 4 Raqibul Hasan, 5 Shakib Al Hasan (capt), 6 Mushfiqur Rahim (wk), 7 Mohammad Ashraful, 8 Naeem Islam, 9 Shafiul Islam, 10 Abdur Razzak, 11 Rubel Hossain. #p#With Dwayne Bravo ruled out of the tournament with a knee injury, West Indies have been shorn of a key allrounder and a cunning allsorts bowler who would have been very handy in the conditions. But an unchanged side is on the cards after a handsome and morale-boosting win over the Dutch. #p#West Indies (probable) 1 Chris Gayle, 2 Devon Smith, 3 Darren Bravo, 4 Ramnaresh Sarwan, 5 Shivnarine Chanderpaul, 6 Kieron Pollard, 7 Devon Thomas (wk), 8 Darren Sammy (capt), 9 Sulieman Benn, 10 Nikita Miller, 11 Kemar Roach. #p#Pitch and conditions The word in town is that a more helpful spinning wicket has been prepared for this fixture, though that is a common refrain - the likelihood is another shock-absorber of a surface. The weather conditions are not a problem, and it's much warmer than during the Ireland fixture, so dew should be even less of a factor under the lights. #p#Stats and trivia #p#Bangladesh have not faced West Indies in 50-over cricket since their tour of the Caribbean in July 2009, in which they achieved a clean sweep in the three-match series, and also triumphed in the Test series, against a team stricken by industrial action. #p#Bangladesh could have as many as nine survivors from that final ODI, at Basseterre. West Indies can still call upon the services of five players, including the captain Darren Sammy, and the paceman Kemar Roach. #p#Chris Gayle needs one run to reach 8000 in ODIs. #p#Quotes #p#"Obviously we want to go to the next round. It is not as if we have to win tomorrow because we will have three more matches but a win will surely take us a step forward." Shakib Al Hasan has his eyes set on victory #p#"You can say Bangladesh are ranked higher than us, but we have to go out and play to the best of our ability. We won't be taking them lightly, but at the end of the day, they are beatable, we have done it before. We have a gameplan and we will go out and execute it." Darren Sammy wants West Indies to play to their reputation, not their ranking
19	504122	Bangladesh v West Indies, Group B, World Cup 2011, Mirpur	'Not a must-win game' - Shakib	Sidharth Monga in Mirpur	March 3, 2011	#p#Months before the World Cup started, when the groups were drawn up, instinctively one match was looked upon as the potential knockout before the knockouts. That match is upon us. Bangladesh, ranked higher than West Indies in the ICC one-day rankings, and not undeservingly so looking at the results over the last year or two, meet West Indies at home. However, Ireland and England have jumbled up the equations a bit, and this match is not as simple as a winners-go-to-quarters affair. #p#That doesn't make the game any less importance though. The team that loses this one will have to travel a long road back into contention. The captains of the sides sought to not talk the game up. #p#"To me nothing has changed," Darren Sammy said of the upset that Ireland pulled off on Wednesday night to become one of the outside contenders themselves. "Every team in this tournament came out to give a good account of themselves. For me every match is a very important match. We have played two games, we focused on each team on the day we played. Now we focus on Bangladesh, and are looking to go out there and execute whatever plans we have in stock." #p#Shakib Al Hasan, the Bangladesh captain, said this was not their last chance. "Obviously we want to go to the next round," Shakib said. "It is not as if we have to win tomorrow because we will have three more matches, but a win will surely take us a step forward." #p#Ireland's win over England has thrown the group wide open, but Bangladesh do not want to think too far ahead at the moment. "I don't know how the Ireland game will benefit us," Shakib said. "It will do so only if we beat England too." #p#Shakib Al Hasan said Bangladesh's win in the West Indies in 2009 would give them confidence Associated Press Enlarge #p#Coming back to Friday's game, both the captains said they could win, the rider being if their sides played as well as they are capable of. "If we play well West Indies are definitely beatable," Shakib said. Bangladesh swept a two-match Test series and a three-match one-day series in the West Indies in July 2009, but Shakib said he realised that was not a full-strength squad (several West Indies players had skipped the series due to a feud with the board over contracts). "That team did not have some senior players," he said. "They have all gained in experience, and with the return of Chris Gayle, Ramnaresh Sarwan and Shivnarine Chanderpaul, they are a better side now. #p#"But in the back of our minds we will always know that we have beaten them at their home. We will not go onto the back foot even before the start. It is our home and we have so much support. If we consider that, I think the advantage they think they have because of the return of their seniors will be neutralised." #p#Sammy was expectedly asked about his side being ranked lower than Bangladesh. "Cricket is played on the day," he said. "You saw what happened on Wednesday night. England scored 327, Ireland chased it down. You can say Bangladesh are ranked higher than us, but we have to go out and play to the best of our ability. We won't be taking them lightly, but at the end of the day, they are beatable; we have done it before." #p#Playing to the best of their ability seemed to both captains' refrain of the day, and if their sides heed their call, it will be some game.

Players/Officials: Sulieman Benn | Chris Gayle | Kemar Roach | Darren Sammy | Shakib Al Hasan | Tamim Iqbal Matches: Bangladesh v West Indies at Dhaka Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Bangladesh | West Indies #p#Bangladesh's batsmen froze catastrophically in a performance that was a throwback to their years of ineptitude in the early 2000s, as West Indies sauntered to <m5>a nine-wicket victory</m5> in a contest that spanned just 31.1 overs. As the mood within a packed and expectant Mirpur stadium turned from excitement to fury, with subsequent reports of an attack on the Windies' team bus , <m6>Bangladesh shipped all ten wickets in 18.5 overs to be routed for 58</m6> - the lowest total ever made by a Full Member nation in World Cup history. #p#It was a craven performance in a critical contest. With the permutations in Group B blown wide open by England's loss to the Irish, both teams knew that the winner of this match would have one foot firmly planted in the quarter-finals. However, the cool efforts of Sulieman Benn , Kemar Roach and Darren Sammy - the only three West Indian bowlers called upon - proved too much for a feckless batting line-up that never tried to recover from <m7>the third-ball dismissal of its linchpin, Tamim Iqbal</m7>. #p#After out-muscling Ireland in a low-scoring thriller last week, Bangladesh began their third contest full of optimism, with the crowd reacting wildly to Shakib Al Hasan's correct call at the toss. However, the din was sucked clean out of the stadium by <m8>Roach's third delivery of the match, a full-length outswinger which Tamim flashed loosely to Sammy at second slip for a duck.</m8> #p#Roach, who wrapped up West Indies' victory over the Netherlands on Monday with a hat-trick, <m9>had four wickets in his last six World Cup deliveries</m9>. The confidence in his team's performance was instantly tangible, and three overs later the captain Sammy was back in the thick of things, <m10>this time with his own third delivery, as Imrul Kayes feathered a short ball through to the keeper for 5</m10>. #p#<m11>Mushfiqur Rahim - one of the cooler heads in the Bangladeshi dressing-room - then flicked his fourth ball loosely to short midwicket to give Sammy two in seven</m11>, and though <m12>Junaid Siddique prevented Bangladesh's score from stalling with a cool flow of boundaries in a 27-ball 25</m12>, <m13>his token resistance was ended by the extra pace of Roach, who took the pitch out of the equation with a pinpoint yorker that struck the batsman flush on the toe.</m13> #p#<m14>At 36 for 4</m14>, the collapse was only just gathering pace. <m15>Shakib once again looked in prime form with a classy slap for four off Sammy</m15>, but <m16>he had not added to his total when he joined the procession one over later, bowled by the second over of Benn's new spell as he hung back in his crease and offered next to no resistance as the stumps were broken by a full-length tweaker.</m16> #p#<m17>Next up came Raqibul Hasan</m17>, who revived the crowd briefly by bringing up <m18>Bangladesh's 50 in the 14th over</m18> with a poke to third man, but <m19>two balls later silence reigned once again as Sammy served up a rare wide delivery, and Raqibul obligingly slapped a cut to point for 4.</m19> #p#<m20>Mohammad Ashraful confirmed the quality and trustworthiness of the surface with two elegant fours in his 21-ball stay - a drive through the covers and a fierce cut through point</m20> - but <m21>Roach's extra pace once again made the difference, as Ashraful wafted the first ball of his sixth over to the keeper.</m21> <m22>Naeem Islam, by this stage, had also been and gone, beaten by Benn's extra bounce to poke another catch to the keeper.</m22> #p#The end had been nigh right from <m23>the moment of Tamim's departure</m23>, but the denouement was pathetic. <m24>Shafiul Islam faced up to a field including a slip and a gully, and chose an open-faced prod straight into the hands of the latter</m24>, and <m25>one delivery later, a Benn yorker proved sufficient to peg back Rubel Hossain's off stump.</m25> #p#As they retreated to the dressing-room, the Bangladesh team was showered with torn-up "4" and "6" placards by a livid and bitterly disappointed crowd, who were streaming from the exits throughout the West Indies' 78-ball chase. <m26>Chris Gayle nudged his first delivery through point to bring up his 8000th run in ODI cricket</m26>, before sealing the mismatch with <m27>a 36-ball 37</m27>. <m28>Devon Smith, who was bowled for 6 by Naeem, was the only man to miss out on a day of total Caribbean dominance.</m28> #p#Match Timeline

Associated Press Enlarge Related Links Matches: Bangladesh v West Indies at Dhaka Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Bangladesh | West Indies #p#The match between West Indies and Bangladesh was expected to be a close contest, and one that would provide a huge boost to the winning team's chances of making the quarter-finals. Instead, West Indies made sure that the match was a completely one-sided affair. Bangladesh's inept batting performance coupled with a disciplined bowling display by West Indies meant that the hosts' score in the end was one of the lowest in World Cups. Quite a few records were set during the course of the low-scoring first innings. Here is a look at a few of them. #p#Fourth-lowest total in World Cups. <m1>Bangladesh's 58</m1> is the second total below 100 in the 2011 World Cup after Kenya's 69 against New Zealand. Overall, it is the fourth-lowest in World Cups and Bangladesh's lowest ever in ODIs. #p#Lowest total against West Indies in World Cups. <m2>Bangladesh's 58</m2> is the lowest total by any team against West Indies in World Cups. The previous lowest was Scotland's 68 in the 1999 World Cup. The lowest total in all ODIs against West Indies is Pakistan's 43 in Cape Town in 1993. #p#Fewest overs played. <m3>The entire Bangladesh innings lasted just 18.5 overs</m3> making it the fourth-lowest on the list of least overs faced in a team innings in World Cups. The least number of overs faced by any team is 14 by Namibia against Australia in the 2003 World Cup. The total of 31.1 overs played in the match is the second-lowest aggregate number of overs in a World Cup match. The record is 140 balls in the match between Canada and Sri Lanka in the 2003 World Cup. #p#Most deliveries remaining after the chase. <m4>West Indies won by nine wickets with 226 balls to spare.</m4> This is in eighth position on the list of matches won with most deliveries to spare. The record is 277 balls, when England beat Canada in the 1979 World Cup. #p#Victory margin. <m5>The nine-wicket win</m5> is the fifth time West Indies have won by a margin of nine wickets or more in World Cups. Their two ten-wicket wins have come against Zimbabwe and Pakistan. It is also the second-largest margin of victory in chases for West Indies in matches against Bangladesh. #p#<m6>Benn's best bowling</m6>. <m7>Sulieman Benn's 4 for 18</m7> is his second four-wicket haul and his best bowling figures in ODIs. He has 25 wickets at an average of 31.32 from 22 ODIs.

There were no injuries, the team management confirmed to ESPNcricinfo, and both squads were safely back at the hotel but the players were shaken. #p#News of the incident spread across the world within moments and will raise questions about the security provided to teams at the tournament. #p#"This is some b*******," Chris Gayle tweeted moments after the incident. "Bangladesh stoning our bus!!! Freaking glass break!!! This is c***, can't believe..what next bullets!!!! Kiss teeth" #p#The team's media manager, Philip Spooner, confirmed that two windows cracked, but none shattered, and hence no stone made its way inside. "We left the ground, and on our way back to the hotel, a couple of stones did hit our window," Spooner said. "We are now back at the hotel, both teams are back at the hotel and are safe." #p#The incident occurred after <m3>West Indies completed a crushing nine-wicket victory over the hosts</m3> in a match that lasted all of 31.1 overs. The discontent among the crowd could be seen when they started throwing the placards that have "4" and "6" written on them onto the playing field the moment Bangladesh lost their last wicket to be <m4>bowled out for their lowest-ever ODI total - 58</m4>. #p#The stones hit the bus when it was about three minutes on its way back to the hotel. Spooner said that the team manager, Richie Richardson, would notify the respective boards and the ICC soon. There was no panic, he said. "Just make sure you mention that nobody got hurt, everybody is safe. There is no panic, everybody is fine." #p#Gayle was not that calm about it. He tweeted again: "This is ridiculous!!! Damn!!! W Cup with so many security an this happen!! Big Joke!!! Trust me I'm not keen here!!! Av (every) players lay flat!!!" #p#A Bangladesh police official said the fans had mistaken the West Indies bus for the Bangladesh bus. "The fans thought it was the Bangladeshi team bus and they hurled stones at it," Imtiaz Ahmed, deputy commissioner of police in Dhaka, told AFP. "The window panes were shattered, but no one was injured." #p#Mustafa Kamal, the Bangladesh Cricket Board president, apologised for the incident, but insisted that there was enough security in place. "We are sorry about the incident. This is the first time it is happening here," he said. "Now we will take extra care. Much more security measures will be taken care of." #p#Kamal said the stones did not come from inside the cordoned-off area, but from far away from the main road. "Enough and adequate security measures were in place," he said. "The teams were moving away from the ground to the hotel, and there were enough convoys. There were three buses: one was a dummy bus and the two others were the team buses. The entire route was cordoned off by the police, and the security was enough. #p#"Four or five stones came at one go from maybe five or six people standing far away from the main road. All the stones came in at one time and they were coming from far away from the main road. That's why the glass was not shattered. The matter is being investigated. Definitely, they will be able to catch the guys." #p#Kamal was at the team hotel to meet both sets of players. "Normally we know our crowd, they are okay," Kamal said. "The match was undoubtedly much below the expectation, and the crowd was a little upset. They wanted to show their anger and frustration against the Bangladeshi boys."

Players/Officials: Chris Gayle | Darren Sammy Matches: Bangladesh v West Indies at Dhaka Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Bangladesh | West Indies #p#When Darren Sammy was named West Indies captain in October last year, one of the few people he received support from was the man he replaced - Chris Gayle, who said at the time: "We are all there to try and guide and help him." Gayle lived up to his word on Friday, giving the West Indies team a pre-match motivational speech and warning that Bangladesh would be up for the game. #p#Sammy was appreciative of Gayle's contribution. "We were a little flat in the warm-up and he [Gayle] didn't like that, so he encouraged us to go out there and remember Bangladesh would be coming hard at us," Sammy told AFP. "Gayle told us 'do not take Bangladesh lightly'." #p#West Indies obviously took Gayle seriously, for what followed was <m2>a nine-wicket demolition of Bangladesh</m2> which lasted just 31.1 overs. #p#Gayle led West Indies for three years before he was axed, a decision the West Indies board made shortly after Gayle had decided against signing a central contract, thus freeing him to play Twenty20 competitions in other countries even if board commitments had to be compromised. He is, however, still a vital part of West Indies' squad, and Sammy praised his commitment to the team, saying Gayle played even though he was not feeling well. #p#"It was a brilliant performance by my team-mates," Sammy said. "Chris Gayle wasn't feeling well today but I thought he came out and showed how committed he is to the cause." <m3>Sammy, himself, made an important contribution, taking three wickets</m3> and <m4>a sharp slip catch to remove the dangerous Tamim Iqbal</m4>, as <m5>West Indies bowled Bangladesh out for 58</m5>. #p#There was not much left for Gayle to do with the bat, but he crossed an important landmark, going past 8,000 one-day runs on his way to <m6>an unbeaten 37</m6>. Gayle said he was a bit surprised that the match, which had been built up as a crunch tie in Group B, had been such an anti-climax. "I was expecting a bigger occasion than this but having said that the wicket seems to be doing a bit," Gayle said. "<m7>Kemar Roach [who took 3 for 19] did a brilliant job</m7> and all the bowlers stepped up to the plate. The wicket seems to be doing a bit for the spinners." #p#<m8>The win</m8> gives West Indies four points from three games, and Gayle was confident his team was on their way to the knockouts. "This will take us through to quarter-final," he said, but was quick to add: "We can't relax. Ireland, India and England games are coming. I am trying to spend some time in the middle; I was trying to sort things out as quickly as possible and I will try to give the team good starts." #p#West Indies went into the game ranked lower than Bangladesh in the ICC one-day rankings, and many tipped Bangladesh's home advantage to give them the edge. Sammy, however, said he was always confident it was a winnable game. "We went out there knowing how crucial this game was for us," he said. "We've always fancied ourselves, but it's up to us to go out there and play competitive and consistent cricket." They will now hope to take that consistency into their next game, another crucial one, against Ireland on March 11.

Getty Images Enlarge Related Links News : WIPA concerned after stone-pelting incident. News : Sammy thanks motivational Gayle. Matches: Bangladesh v West Indies at Dhaka Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Bangladesh | West Indies #p#They finally lost their patience in the stands. While what followed outside the stadium was an unacceptable reaction to a terrible performance, it should not be forgotten that a vast majority of the people in Dhaka have been extremely well-behaved and patient, even after <m1>this defeat</m1>. #p#For more than two weeks now, it has been exhilarating to watch the atmosphere in the streets of Dhaka. The people rightly came in for a lot of praise from whoever has travelled here in the last month or so. It hasn't been easy for the people, though. Genuinely, it hasn't. #p#The Bangabandhu Stadium, the venue of the opening ceremony, could take in only 25,000 people, but at least the same number danced in joy outside the stadium throughout the night. Before that, when Pakistan played the hosts in a warm-up game at Shere Bangla National Stadium, half of the bona fide ticket-holders were denied entry because of an organisational fiasco. #p#On the real match days, the fans have lined up hours in advance of each game, only to be told by overbearing security that the gates will not open that early. None of the games has been full at the start precisely for that reason. Once in, they have been stunned by Virender Sehwag, they have seen Tamim Iqbal give up the chase - huge albeit - in favour of some batting practice, and they have seen the batsmen fail against Ireland too. There has been the odd reward, especially the spirited comeback against Ireland. But even then, a life was lost in a traffic accident during celebrations after that game. #p#Yet the fans have carried on smiling. You tell them they should not be bothering the players during nets session, and they wait for hours outside the stadium to catch a glimpse of their heroes - or whatever is visible of them from the bus windows. No complaints, no ugly scenes, no attempt to sneak themselves in. Their patience finally ran out today. They cheered the last two Bangladesh wickets as their heroes made their way to <m2>their lowest total ever</m2>, and also significantly the lowest by a Full Member in the history of the World Cup. Only then did the fours and sixes start raining on the ground, because before leaving their seats, the fans shredded all their "4" and "6" placards, and flung them towards the playing surface. #p#The West Indies innings was surreal. For the first time the crowd here cheered an opposition batsman hitting a boundary. <m3>Devon Smith got out, but you couldn't tell that from the crowd reaction.</m3> The dholis , the men who play the double-headed drum, who had danced their way to a trance after the win over Ireland, didn't quite know what to do, and watched stunned. The PA system, though, went on with its attempt to orchestrate the atmosphere at the ground, which anyway is grating and artificial at the best of times. It was horrendous today, but the man there was just doing his job. The Titanic was sinking, but the violin, cello and piano were all still playing. #p#The ugliness that followed on the streets - besides the attack on the West Indies team bus, there have been reports of rioting and poster-burning from the Dhaka University area - cannot be condoned, but at the same time is not representative of the average cricket follower here. The average cricket fan can claim to have displayed what their team failed to muster: patience. #p#Therein lies a huge lesson for the cricketers, provided they are willing to learn it. It's the lesson of patience, of building an innings, whatever the format may be. On today's evidence, they have a lot to learn. After a spirited show in the field helped them escape against Ireland, it beggars belief that the Bangladeshi batsmen thought they needed to score 1200 runs off their allotted 300 deliveries today. Forget the dismissals, <m4>the first ball Shakib Al Hasan faced today summed up the muddle that their minds right now are</m4>. <m5>The score was 25 for 3, it was the sixth over</m5>, and <m6>the captain went after a wide one, no feet movement, just pushing at it and getting a thick edge</m6>. #p#<m7>Mushfiqur Rahim watched a short midwicket walk into position, but still couldn't find enough presence of mind to refrain from playing in that directon, and it was neither a slower delivery nor one that gripped the surface</m7>. <m8>Raqibul Hasan simply didn't move his feet, but his body had to stretch appreciably to reach a wide and full delivery, just so that he could drive it straight to point</m8>. #p#There seems to be this need to impose themselves on the opposition, but even the best and most imposing batsmen in the history of the game have known how to respect a match situation - if not the bowlers involved in that situation. Special batsmen like Virender Sehwag and Tamim can be allowed to bat like that, but not all 11 members of a team. There is a thin line between counterattack and the lack of willingness to face the heat. With Bangladesh batsmen that line blurs a lot. #p#The sad part is that none of it came as a surprise. They all did the same against Ireland, except for Raqibul who fought it out till the end. When asked if they had failed to learn their lesson from last Friday, Shakib repeated what he has been saying all along. "We have been consistent with the bat for the last one year. This is something - what should I say  I don't think in the last 12 to 15 months, we have batted this badly. But in cricket it can always happen. But we still have a chance to qualify for the quarter-final, we have to come back strongly and do the right things." #p#He also said that this was the worst day of his cricketing career, but that it could get worse. The local reporters suggested he was hinting about his captaincy career, should the team get eliminated in the first round. His words, though, proved to be prophetic. The day did indeed get worse, thanks to the unacceptable anger outside the stadium.
19	504317	Bangladesh v West Indies, Group B, World Cup 2011, Mirpur	Bangladesh bus was also hit, says Ian Pont	Sidharth Monga in Mirpur	March 4, 2011	Bangladesh's fans did not take <m1>their side's loss to West Indies</m1> well. Getty Images Enlarge Related Links News : WIPA concerned after stone-pelting incident. News : West Indies team bus stoned in Dhaka. Players/Officials: Ian Pont Matches: Bangladesh v West Indies at Dhaka Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Bangladesh | West Indies #p#Ian Pont, Bangladesh's bowling coach, has told ESPNcricinfo that, in addition to West Indies' bus, the Bangladesh team bus was also hit on its way back from the Shere Bangla Stadium, after the home team suffered <m2>a huge defeat to West Indies</m2> in a game that lasted all of 31.1 overs. Pont said there was no way the West Indian players were specifically targeted. #p#"I think there was something that hit our bus," Pont said, but also confirmed there hasn't been any injury. "Nothing like that [injury or panic]. Just that when we got off the bus, we saw the windows had been thrashed. People were throwing things at the bus as we were speeding along. We were going along very quickly, so these things kind of bounced off rather than hit the bus with full force. They ricocheted off, and bounced off to the side." #p#The BCB president, Mustafa Kamal, had earlier said that both the buses left the ground together, led by a dummy bus. In that scenario it is quite possible that the throwers of stones didn't quite know who was in which bus. Pont agreed with the theory. "The incident we had is probably a minor one, but the point is there shouldn't be any. We are a host country, and I am thinking it's our disgruntled fans. I am absolutely sure that they wouldn't have deliberately targeted the West Indies' vehicle. They were just throwing stuff at buses. All the buses look the same, and we have got blue curtains up. I am not even sure they could even see, so they were just throwing anything." #p#Fan site condemns incident. A popular fan site, BanglaCricket , has started a campaign to condemn the attackers of the team buses and to apologise to the cricketers. It is led by this message from the site administrators: "Please send flowers to the West Indies Cricket team staying at the Pan Pacific Sonargaon Hotel. No need to make any statement. The flowers will be message enough. Please Copy/Paste this as your status update, call as many people you know in Dhaka, and ask them to do the same. Let's do this!" #p#Pont strongly condemned the incident. "You cannot throw bricks and stones at cricketers. I understand fans get emotional. You have to control your emotions, you can't let it spill over into violence. This is effectively violence. And I think the West Indies were a bit more shaken up." #p#He empathised with Chris Gayle's strong reaction on Twitter. "Chris Gayle commented on that, didn't he? What's next? Bullets or something? [is what Gayle tweeted]. I think it comes to people's minds. We are very aware that there is a lot of security around the team, we are very aware there is a lot of security around the World Cup itself. Up until now, everything seems to have gone okay. Security seems to be pretty good, and there have been no incidents. This is the first one as far as I know. It is disappointing - it's probably a few stupid fans showing their emotion, but you can't be throwing bricks and stones at international cricketers. At the end of the day it is just a game of cricket. It's all it is." #p#Pont spoke of how the worst comes to your mind when you are stuck in such an incident. "The bottom line is it doesn't reflect very well. This is the issue really. Incidents happen all the time. People blow off firecrackers or they get upset, or they call players names. I understand supporters get disappointed and angry, but it can't spill over into violence or lawlessness. While these are isolated incidents, we don't want a repeat of anything that happened to the Sri Lankan cricketers [in 2009]. I know that's on people's minds sometimes when things happen, when a bus gets attacked. You don't know who is attacking you, you don't know what they are attacking you with. When someone's throwing things at a bus, and it is making a loud noise, you don't quite know what's going on." #p#The Daily Star also reported that a few fans on motorbikes threw stones at Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan's Magura home, leaving a window-pane broken. "I went to the mosque to offer prayers and heard that some unidentified people did it," Shakib's father Mashrur Reza, said. The police stated that the incident was an isolated one, and that security had been deployed. #p#The Bangladesh fans, Pont said, are usually better behaved. "I think we have crowds here that show their dissatisfaction vocally. They shout out and abuse the players if they are not happy. People pay their 400 taka and they come and have a shout, I understand that. [But] To resort to violence is never acceptable."
19	504324	Bangladesh v West Indies, ICC World Cup, Group B, Mirpur	Sammy leads from the front	Sidharth Monga in Dhaka	March 4, 2011	#p#They didn't say it before the game, but it hurt West Indies that Bangladesh were ranked higher than them. <m1>After the game was over</m1>, where <m2>the hosts had been humbled for 58</m2>, Darren Sammy admitted that the ranking brought out an aggressive edge to their performance. #p#"We knew we had a point to prove, with Bangladesh ranked higher than us in the rankings," he said. "We were playing them at home, and we came out and gave it everything. It worked. It was a perfect display of how to go out there and bowl on a flat wicket." #p#It wasn't difficult to beat a team bent on self-combustion, but the way West Indies did it, never letting their foot off the drowning opposition's throat, was impressive. They were not content with taking early wickets and then chasing 200, they wanted to make a bigger statement. They used only three bowlers, all three of whom were in wicket-taking form today, and they gave themselves the best chance of taking wickets by having an adequate number of men in catching positions. #p#For all the criticism Sammy has come in for in the lead-up to this game, he bowled, and more importantly, led the side perfectly. West Indies have a thin bowling line-up in the absence of Dwayne Bravo, which means they are playing only one genuine wicket-taking seam bowler. Given all that, it is a huge risk to open the bowling with Sulieman Benn, for if he has an off day there is a serious dearth of bowlers who can make the new ball count. #p#Kemar Roach was one of just three bowlers West Indies need to do the job in Dhaka. Getty Images Enlarge #p#Sammy put his hand up. Not only did he put his hand up, he did so immediately after <m3>Benn went for nine in his first over</m3>. He realised pretty soon that Bangladesh were trying to expose the weak resources by attacking Benn. <m4>And then Sammy produced three wickets.</m4> They were not magic deliveries, but they hardly ever are with Sammy. Before the match he said he felt he was one good performance away from coming to form, and it is tough to argue against <m5>a sharp catch</m5>, <m6>three wickets</m6> and the man's diving all over the place to stop runs. #p#Sammy, though, said he knew this was just one good performance, and wouldn't mean much if it is not replicated. "I had belief in myself," he said. "As a leader, you want good performances. I have been practising well, I knew a good performance was just around the corner. Now I need to be consistent. I really needed this performance, the team needed this performance, the people back home in the Caribbean needed that performance." #p#Another example of how charged up the team was is how Chris Gayle ignored illness and turned up for the game. "It shows how committed he [Gayle] is to the World Cup cause," Sammy said. "To the West Indies cricket. He wasn't feeling too well yesterday and today morning, but he opted to play. Before he went out, he gave us a pep talk, telling us to not underestimate Bangladesh. He is the kind of player the guys respond to. It was very good of him to step up and let the guys know that we have a job to do out there. He has been an inspiration for us, and we went out there every confidently and got the job done." #p#West Indies can't afford to get carried away, though. They have beaten Netherlands and Bangladesh, teams the West Indies of past would overcome in their sleep. The big games are yet to come. Sammy agrees. "I would not say that," Sammy said when he was asked if they have suddenly become contenders for the title. "We know what we came here to do, we need to focus on each game, and only that game. So we have Ireland next, we are focusing on Ireland. Not the quarter-finals, not India, not England. Just Ireland. We are taking it step by step."
19	504343			Nihad Kabir		Choice of game. Thank God it's Friday! Most of Bangladesh's matches are in Bangladesh, and on Fridays, which is our weekend. Weeks were spent cajoling, coercing, begging and borrowing for tickets (my cohorts and I have just stopped short of stealing - although not by much  ). So eight of us turned up to watch this match, all pumped up after Bangladesh's show against Ireland. Match? What match? Thirty-odd overs do not make an ODI. A week's effort for the tickets blown away like a puff of dust in just short of two and a half hours of mayhem from one side and mass self-destruction from the other.   #p# Team supported. Having tried to scream, shout, wave flag, jump up and down for Bangladesh in the first innings, together with only about a hundred million other citizens of this country, I promptly switched in the second innings to the team I've supported since in the glory days of Papa Lloyd and King Viv, all through their own desperate straits. I still love the West Indians and their cricket, but when Bangladesh play, all other bets are off.  #p# World Cup prediction. Would Pakistan vs West Indies be a prediction or wishful thinking? Probably the latter. Pakistan versus Australia or South Africa would be fun, the former team being good for a few thrills one way or the other, and their progress has been remarkably smooth (for them) so far.  #p# Key performer. Umm, didn't have time to figure that one out. I guess after reading last night that Darren Sammy's recent bowling average over the last few matches was nearing 80 and his batting average around seven, <m1>his three-for</m1> qualifies, together with the bowling of Kemar Roach and Sulieman Benn. As for Bangladesh, the sooner someone realises that Mohammad Ashraful is responsible for more key non-performances than not, the better.   #p# One thing I'd have changed.  The result! Okay, a fast and ferocious innings from Tamim Iqbal right up front - that might have changed the complexion of the day for a lot of people, regardless of win or loss. Maybe Shakib Al Hasan should stop winning the toss as well.  #p# Wow moment. <m2>A murderous flat-batted swat from Chris Gayle over the head of mid-on.</m2>  And the arrival of my little nephew in a Bangladesh jersey and yellow sunglasses, all of two overs before the match ended.   #p# Crowd meter. Someone cut off the power to the meter, methinks, except when the Bangladesh team came out to field to noises of derision, and the huge cheers from the sparse crowd that remained at <m3>the fours hit by the West Indies batsmen</m3>. The largest cheers overall came when Shakib won the toss, and after the Bangladesh national anthem. Says it all, doesn't it?  #p# Fancy-dress index. Never got a chance to check it all out given the breakneck speed of the game, but today it goes to the eight traditional drummers in yellow doing the cheerleading. Everyone else hid their tiger costumes faster than a Thommo bouncer.  #p# Banner of the day. Outside the stadium at the end of the game, I spotted a poster in Bangla that read: "How did Tigers turn in to mice? BCB answer us!" The original was rather more colourful.  #p# ODIs v Twenty20. Test matches any day. Since that's not an option here, ODIs. Twenty20s are too short and gimmicky, and those cheerleaders are dire.  #p# Marks out of 10. For Bangladeshis, about 3; at least we got to see Chris Gayle close-ish up. For West Indians, a resounding 10.

PA Photos Enlarge Related Links News : Bangladesh players asked not to write columns. News : Tamim says Mirpur incidents won't affect Bangladesh. Players/Officials: Shakib Al Hasan | Jamie Siddons Matches: Bangladesh v West Indies at Dhaka Teams: Bangladesh #p#Bangladesh's captain and coach have hit back at the former players who have been criticising the team in newspaper columns and on talk shows on news channels. There has been widespread criticism of the team management after <m1>their dismal effort against West Indies - 58 all out</m1>. Neither Jamie Siddons nor Shakib Al Hasan pulled punches in response to the criticism. #p#In a press conference in Chittagong, Siddons said, "We try not to read the paper or listen to what people write. Everybody's got to write, they write what they want. [However], lot of players are disappointed by the past players having their say. And I am disappointed by some of the past players who are saying stuff about me as well. I wish they had the b*** to say that to my face. Some of them are not that courageous." #p#Shakib expressed his disappointment in a column he wrote in Prothom Alo. Shakib suggested that his team has not performed as badly as the previous teams did. Loosely translated, he wrote, "I don't think there are former players in Bangladesh who have not faced such a humiliation. We have faced such a situation once or twice, but there are former cricketers who have been in such situations often. So everyone needs to think before talking. I am not saying that every former cricketer is trying to run us down. There have been some who have lent out a supporting hand. That has been our biggest boost." #p#Siddons was more forgiving of the people that threw stones at Shakib's house. "Some people react," Siddons said. "Things happen in every country of the world, after crazy performances like that." That just suggests how irked the team is by the columns and the talk shows. #p#That is perhaps because there is no doubting that the majority of the crowd has been good and well behaved. "These people are very big supporters of cricket, very big supporters of the Bangladesh cricket team," Siddons said. "I saw nothing different when we drove in today, or yesterday from the airport. Unbelievable support. Everyone was disappointed by our performance, but everyone needs to realise these are the best 15 players in Bangladesh, and they are doing their best. If they have bad performances, that's the way it is. We are trying, we are doing our best. We'll play good cricket against England. Inshaallah." #p#However, Siddons said that the unrealistic expectations of his side could have played a part in the ugly public reaction and also in the players' failure to play freely. "Yeah I think the expectations are unrealistically high for this World Cup," Siddons said. "Definitely for our team. Two years in, we have improved a lot, but the expectations are high. We were playing at home. We expected it to be a good contest with West Indies. We expected to push them. On that wicket, if we made a decent score or if we bowled first, the result might have been different. Because it spun, it would have helped our bowling against their batting, but we had no runs to play with." #p#All this, Siddons said, has made the side more determined. "Definitely more determined. And also makes us realise where we are at. We need to improve some things, and we can be - because of our youth and age - up and down. Don't expect us to be that down, though. We have been playing better cricket for the last 12 months, and that was out of the blue. No one expected that, that's why we are so devastated."
20	504281	World Cup 2011	A clash of contrasting bowling philosophies	Osman Samiuddin in Colombo	March 4, 2011	Sri Lanka's primary weapon will be spin, but Lasith Malinga lurks as a major threat AFP Enlarge Related Links Report : Rain ruins match after Sangakkara fifty News : Sri Lanka may play three spinners Preview : Title contenders clash in 2007 final replay Players/Officials: Mitchell Johnson | Jason Krejza | Brett Lee | Lasith Malinga | Ajantha Mendis | Muttiah Muralitharan | Shaun Tait Matches: Sri Lanka v Australia at Colombo (RPS) Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Australia | Sri Lanka #p#How straightforward Group A appears. Big teams beat little ones, jostle with each other for positions and off they go to the quarters. In contrast to Group B, where Ireland, England, Bangladesh and the West Indies have provided major palpitations, this group of non-death has moved along at a steady heartbeat, an occasional mild blip disturbing the quorum. #p#There's only been one real crackerjack game, last weekend's Pakistan-Sri Lanka encounter, and even that was soon eclipsed by two games at the Chinnaswamy. But Saturday's encounter at the Premadasa between Sri Lanka and Australia is a big game, even if it might be without grave consequence. That should, the hope is, free both sides to provide the kind of game they are eminently capable of: attractive, intense and tight. #p#The headline duel is between the bowling attacks of the sides, an expected battle between pace and spin and that is a relief. Group B games in India, riveting as they have been, have removed bowlers from the equation of cricket altogether, among the primary reasons the format is said to be struggling. Not so at the Premadasa, which, like a benevolent judge, has so far granted favour to those only who deserve it, be they batsmen, fast bowlers, spinners or otherwise. #p#Australia's reliance on pace is commendable, in a bulldozing kind of way because it goes against the supposed grain of subcontinent thinking. You wouldn't expect a former fast man of the pedigree of Waqar Younis to say otherwise, but there is merit even in his simple logic: most sides will have fast bowlers bowl 30 overs out of 50. Automatically their role is correspondingly important. #p#But in Brett Lee, Shaun Tait and Mitchell Johnson, Australia have as fiercely quick and penetrative a trio as any in this tournament. It isn't subtle and on off days each can become one-dimensional but it is relentless. With pace, that is often enough. Sri Lanka's batsmen, however, will provide their first real test. #p#The hosts are openly talking about playing three spinners and given how Australia have gone against spin in the warm-up games, the strategy has considerable merit. All angles are covered if Rangana Herath joins Muttiah Muralitharan and Ajantha Mendis. However, none of them are bursting with recent wickets and Mendis seems not to have moved on from 2008. #p#But runs will not come easy off them, specifically Muralitharan, as Pakistan found. Nervous glances at the scoreboard will become more frequent, the horns and drums will get louder, the fielders closer, the angles tighter, the overs quicker, the runs less forthcoming; death by Sri Lanka is a slow, drawn-out frenzy. Bear in mind, Australia haven't played an ODI in Sri Lanka, in this atmosphere, for just over seven years. #p#The subheads are equally, if not more, intriguing and invert the main battles. Lasith Malinga is back - a paceman fit to take his place among any company and, importantly, he is in rhythm. Ricky Ponting recognises the threat. In an earlier age, Jason Krejza would've been a king spinner. Today he is an anomaly, a spinner unafraid to buy wickets. He will like the surface, but the batsmen will be another matter altogether. #p#Ultimately, we should be grateful to Darrel Hair for giving contests between the two a little modern heat. Some locals feel there is still no sweeter victory than that which comes against the Australians. The World Cup is a fitting stage for it, having hosted semi-finals and finals between the two sides, as well as the forfeited game of 1996. #p#Australia have had the better of it (Sri Lanka are by no means alone in being on the losing end of a rivalry with Australia), having won six of seven games and none of them have been close. But that was a different Australia and, as Kumar Sangakkara noted, a different Sri Lanka. The last ODI series between the two, late last year, had a defining feel about it. There is the belief now of equality.
20	504297	Sri Lanka v Australia, Group A, World Cup 2011, Colombo	Title contenders clash in 2007 final replay	The Preview by Siddarth Ravindran	March 4, 2011	#p#Match Facts March 5, Colombo Start time 2.30 pm (0900 GMT) #p#Shane Watson is Australia's highest run-getter of the tournament so far AFP Enlarge Related Links Features : A clash of contrasting bowling philosophies News : Ponting's men brace for first real challenge News : Sri Lanka may play three spinners Matches: Sri Lanka v Australia at Colombo (RPS) Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Australia | Sri Lanka #p#The Big Picture The last time Australia were scheduled to take on Sri Lanka in a World Cup match in Colombo was in 1996, when Australia pulled out citing security concerns leading to plenty of rancour even before the tournament started. The last time the two teams did meet in the World Cup was in the final of 2007, when a farcical ruling over bad light provided an inept end to a much-maligned tournament. #p#Saturday's encounter, nestled somewhere midway through the competition, will lack the drama of either of those two events, and given the utter woefulness of the smaller teams in Group A, will have only a marginal impact on the tournament, though it is being billed as a 'big game'. The four Test nations in the group are near certainties to make the quarters, so any time two of them clash in the league phase, the result is more a battle for how high in the top four they end up, which will decide how tough their quarter-final opponent will be. #p#One reason to look forward to the match is that in a game increasingly dominated by the bat, where 300 is no longer a safe score, two of the best bowling line-ups in the tournament will face up. On the one hand Sri Lanka have their much-trumpeted, freakish trio of Malinga, Murali and Mendis, and on the other is Australia's old-school fast-and-furious trio of Lee, Tait and Johnson. #p#The match is also a stage for Sri Lanka to justify their billing as one of the favourites, particularly after defeat to Pakistan. And for Australia, the game is the first big challenge to check how healthy their chances of a fourth straight title are. #p#Form guide (completed matches, most recent first) Australia WWWWW Sri Lanka WLWWW #p#Watch out for... Tillakaratne Dilshan has the task of getting Sri Lanka bursting out of the blocks, a job he's accomplished in all three matches this tournament by sprinting to at least 40 each time. Sri Lanka will hope his stand-and-thwack-it method works against the Australian pace battery and takes him to the big score that has eluded him so far. #p#A few months ago, Brett Lee's international career seemed to be over after being sidelined for a year due to an elbow problem. Not only is he back, but like that other oft-injured tearaway, Shoaib Akhtar, he's showing he's lost none of his pace even in his mid-thirties. He was in cracking form in Australia's previous match, tormenting New Zealand's top order, though he didn't get the handful of wickets his spot-on bowling deserved. #p#Team news Australia have had a week's rest since thumping New Zealand, so they will be no need to "manage the workload" of any of their players. They are almost certainly going to stick to the same XI. #p#Australia (probable) 1 Shane Watson, 2 Brad Haddin (wk), 3 Ricky Ponting (capt), 4 Michael Clarke, 5 David Hussey, 6 Cameron White, 7 Steve Smith, 8 Mitchell Johnson, 9 Jason Krezja, 10 Brett Lee, 11 Shaun Tait. #p#Sri Lanka have a couple of decisions to make regarding their bowling. Do they persist with Nuwan Kulasekara or bring back the pacy Thisara Perera, who also provides a big-hitting option lower down the order? Also, the second spinners slot 'remains a toss-up between Rangana Herath and Ajantha Mendis. #p#Sri Lanka (probable) 1 Tillakaratne Dilshan, 2 Upul Tharanga, 3 Kumar Sangakkara (capt & wk), 4 Mahela Jayawardene, 5 Thilan Samaraweera, 6 Angelo Mathews, 7 Chamara Silva, 8 Nuwan Kulasekara, 9 Lasith Malinga, 10 Ajantha Mendis, 11 Muttiah Muralitharan #p#Pitch and conditions It pelted down on Friday evening in Colombo, and there's light rain forecast for Saturday as well. If the weather stays clear, the teams will likely have to deal with a sluggish pitch, the same surface that was used for the Kenya-Sri Lanka match. Malinga's explanation of his array of toe-crushers against Kenya: "This is a slow pitch and bouncers will not work so I decided to go for yorkers." Expect more of the same. #p#Stats and Trivia Australia have lost only one of the seven completed World Cup matches against Sri Lanka - the 1996 final Ricky Ponting has the most number of World Cup catches (27), more than twice as many as any other current player.

20	504315	Sri Lanka v Australia, Group B, World Cup 2011, Colombo	Sri Lanka may play three spinners	Sa'adi Thawfeeq in Colombo	March 4, 2011	#p#Sri Lanka are toying with the idea of throwing in all three of their spinners into the XI for their match against Australia on Saturday, which is expected to see a full house of 35,000 spectators at the R Premadasa Stadium. #p#"That's a possibility that we're exploring," Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara said. "I think that's the best way to play Australia. We've got three main spinners and some part-time spinners in the squad. So we'll have to make a decision on that." #p#Sri Lanka has in their ranks the highest wicket-taker in ODI and Test cricket, the wily Muttiah Muralitharan, as well as unorthodox legspinner Ajantha Mendis and left-arm spinner Rangana Herath. They also have the spin options of Tillakaratne Dilshan and Thilan Samaraweera, who bowl offbreaks, and Chamara Silva, who can chip in with some legbreaks. #p#Attacking Australia with spin is nothing new. In the Champions Trophy semi-final at the Premadasa in 2002, Sri Lanka threw in five spinners: Muralitharan, Kumar Dharmasena, Upul Chandana, Sanath Jayasuriya and Aravinda de Silva, and beat Australia by seven wickets. #p#While Sri Lanka's attack may be built around spin, Sangakkara is aware Australia will rely on their quicks. "The real strength of Australia is their pace attack. They've got four quality pace bowlers who are pretty quick. They probably will come at us very hard, right from ball one. #p#"If we can absorb the pressure and try to be as positive as we can, maybe we can capitalise when spin is introduced. But still, [Jason] Krejza is a very good spinner. He bowls an attacking line." #p#Kumar Sangakkara says he is not worried about winning the toss at the Premadasa AFP Enlarge #p#While there might be changes in Sri Lanka's bowling combination, Sangakkara said there would not be any changes in the middle order, which is considered the weak link of their team. "I don't think we need any drastic changes. When the middle order score runs, I don't think people will ask the same questions." #p#Chamara Silva replaced Chamara Kapugedera after Sri Lanka's first game, against Canada, and got a half-century in the match against Pakistan. Thilan Samaraweera and Angelo Mathews are yet to play a substantial knock in the competition. #p#The Premadasa pitch will be in focus once again for the Sri Lanka-Australia match. It was re-laid before the World Cup, and in three matches in the tournament so far, the ground has seen the team batting first win twice. Prior to being re-laid, the Premdasa had a reputation of being a ground where it was difficult to chase under lights - only three of the last 21 day-night matches there have been won by the team batting second. However, Sangakkara said he would not be too worried about the toss. #p#"The toss is a crucial factor no doubt, but you don't' have to worry about that too much. Most sides probably want to bat first and to put up a big total on this wicket. But the Premadasa has changed over the years and I think it's pretty well balanced, whether you're chasing or batting first. #p#We lost the game against Pakistan by some 10-odd runs. I think we could have got those 10 runs earlier on in the game. We lost four quick wickets and that was a big drawback. Having looked at the Pakistan game, it goes to show that whether you win or lose the toss, the real important thing is to win the match." #p#Lasith Malinga, the Sri Lanka fast bowler, missed the first two matches of the campaign, but returned for the third game and took 6 for 38 against Kenya. Sangakkara said he wanted Malinga to play in all the remaining games of the tournament. #p#"We want him to be as fit as he can be and play all our games. If he's available and ready to play he will play. When you have guys like Malinga, Mathews and Murali you expect them to deliver. You look up to your star bowlers and then the responsibility falls onto the support bowlers to do their bit. We'll try and focus on how we share that responsibility and give freedom to guys like Lasith to express themselves."

Matches: Sri Lanka v Australia at Colombo (RPS) Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Australia | Sri Lanka #p#Torrential downpour forced the game to be abandoned after <m4>Kumar Sangakkara pushed Sri Lanka to 146 for 3 in 32.5 overs</m4>. It was a typical tough scramble of a contest that is expected on a turning track in Sri Lanka. Sangakkara led from the front with a responsible, and skillful, knock to push Sri Lanka towards a competitive total when rain intervened to kill the contest. #p#The way the ball turned and bounced suggested that anything over 250 would be defendable, and it appeared as if Sangakkara was batting with that knowledge in his mind. <m5>He had two good partnerships with Mahela Jayawardene</m5> and <m6>Thilan Samaraweera</m6> before the elements took over. #p#<m7>Jayawardene had added 44 runs with his captain</m7> and they looked in great touch and control. <m8>If Sangakkara tried to punch through the line, Jayawardene looked to caress through the covers; if Sangakkara dabbed to the off, Mahela nudged to the leg, and both ran the singles well.</m8> The run-rate wasn't too high but Sri Lanka looked to be in control as the track was increasingly showing signs of aiding turn and bounce. #p#They thrived on quick singles and ironically, <m9>it led to Jayawardene's dismissal</m9>. <m10>He hesitated after tapping to point and that allowed Steve Smith to fire in a direct hit at the non-striker's end to catch him short of the crease.</m10> <m11>Sri Lanka were 75 for 3</m11> at that stage and the pressure escalated on Sangakkara, but he continued on with his serene style. #p#<m12>Sangakkara's class stood out right from the moment he walked out to the middle</m12> after <m13>Tillakaratne Dilshan combusted early, slashing Shaun Tait to second slip in the second over</m13>. Even as Upul Tharanga struggled for timing and looked to be hurried by the pace, Sangakkara seemed to have time to play the ball late. <m14>He punched Brett Lee to the straight boundary, laced him through the covers and whipped through midwicket to collect 12 runs from the third over.</m14> <m15>He then square drove Shane Watson to the boundary</m15>, but the shot of the day was <m16>a classy on-the-up caressed punch off Mitchell Johnson to the straight boundary in the 12th over</m16>. <m17>Along with Samaraweera</m17>, he ensured there would be no further damage and steered Sri Lanka to a strong position when the ground was deluged by heavy rains.
20	504424	Sri Lanka v Australia, Group A, World Cup 2011, Colombo	Australia escape spin challenge on 'rolled mud'	Brydon Coverdale at the Premadasa Stadium	March 5, 2011	#p#Australia escaped their most serious spin challenge in the tournament so far, thanks to the wash-out in Colombo, where they shared the points with Sri Lanka on a pitch Ricky Ponting described as "basically rolled mud". The ability of Australia's batsmen to handle top spinners in helpful conditions is one of the questions that has surrounded Ponting's side, which now has two wins and a no-result and sits third on the Group A table. #p#However, the Australians have a game in hand compared to the second-placed Sri Lanka, and they have what should be easy matches against Canada and Kenya coming up. The match in Colombo was reasonably evenly-balanced when heavy rain came and set in for the rest of the evening, with <m1>Sri Lanka at 146 for 3</m1>, but the sharp turn being displayed by Jason Krejza was a worrying sign for the Australian batsmen. #p#The hosts picked Muttiah Muralitharan, Ajantha Mendis and Rangana Herath, the first time all three had played together in an ODI, and Ponting knew the trio would be hard to counter. He said in the lead-up to the game that he had been surprised by the lack of spin in the earlier games in Sri Lanka, but a glance at the pitch on the eve of the match suggested it would be a different story this time. #p#"That wicket is vastly different to the wickets that have been used in the previous games that have been played here in this World Cup so far," Ponting said after the washout. "It seemed that they had a pretty good idea that it was going to be that slow and low and was going to spin a fair bit, hence the reason they played their spinners. #p#"You could tell that it was going to be a lot different than the wicket that was played on the day before, because you could see that one right beside it. That one had a bit of grass on it, and the one we were going to use today was basically rolled mud. It spun quite a bit early in the game. What you associate with most one-day wickets is they generally don't do much in the first innings of the game and they might just spin a bit towards the latter half of the second innings of the game. It appeared that this one was going to be a difficult one to chase runs on." #p#<m2>Kumar Sangakkara had set up an interesting contest with an unbeaten 73</m2>. Associated Press Enlarge #p#But the Australians won't know how their batsmen would have fared, as the dark clouds moved in during the second half of Sri Lanka's innings. When the rain came, it bucketed down, and although it had stopped by an hour after the match was abandoned, there was plenty of surface water on the parts of the ground that had not been covered. #p#It was a disappointing end to the most eagerly anticipated Group A match so far in the tournament. Shaun Tait bowled one of his best opening spells in recent times, finding significant outswing to add to his speed, while Krejza created opportunities with his turn and <m3>Kumar Sangakkara was looking determined to bat through the innings, having reached 73 not out</m3>. #p#"I think it might have been a pretty good game of cricket," Ponting said. "They had Sangakkara who played particularly well. <m4>At that stage of the game, 30 overs in and 140 on the board</m4>, we felt like we needed to make another breakthrough before the ball change, or around the ball change. #p#"If we had done that around then and tried to expose their middle order, they had a longer tail today because they played all their spinners. I think we were only one breakthrough away, but saying that they had batted pretty well and it would have been a difficult run-chase considering the way the wicket was playing. I think it would have been a decent game of cricket. I'm disappointed for the crowd more than anything today." #p#The Australians will fly to Bangalore on Sunday and will have two days off before they start to prepare for their matches against Kenya and Canada. Sri Lanka head to Kandy to take on Zimbabwe on Thursday, before they leave home and tackle New Zealand in Mumbai.
20	504428	Sri Lanka v Australia, Group A, World Cup 2011, Colombo	'We were targeting more than 250' - Sangakkara	ESPNcricinfo staff	March 5, 2011	#p#Kumar Sangakkara, the Sri Lanka captain, has said a score in the range of 250 would have tested Australia on the Premadasa track, given that the hosts were playing three specialist spinners. Heavy rain, however, ensured the match was abandoned after 32.5 overs and the teams had to split the two points. #p#"The game was well poised," Sangakkara said. <m1>He was unbeaten on 73</m1> and <m2>together with Thilan Samaraweera had laid a strong platform for a challenging score</m2>. "We were looking at 250 or even more and it would have been a good game. It was the second game on that track and we had three spinners and they would have been pretty useful on that kind of track." #p#Sri Lanka went in to this game with Muttiah Muralitharan, left-arm spinner Rangana Herath and Ajantha Mendis - it was the first time all three featured together in an ODI. The hosts opted to bat and Ricky Ponting, the Australia captain, admitted chasing would have been tough on a such a track, conducive to spin. #p#"You could tell that it was going to be a lot different than the wicket that was played on the day before, because you could see that one right beside it," Ponting said. #p#Rain had the final say at the Premadasa Manoj Ridimahaliyadda Enlarge #p#"That one had a bit of grass on it, and the one we were going to use today was basically rolled mud. It spun quite a bit early in the game. What you associate with most one-day wickets is they generally don't do much in the first innings of the game and they might just spin a bit towards the latter half of the second innings of the game. It appeared that this one was going to be a difficult one to chase runs on." #p#Australia are placed third in Group A, but have a game in hand over second-placed Sri Lanka and face Kenya and Canada in two of their three remaining matches. Sri Lanka take on Zimbabwe in Pallekele next before heading to Mumbai to play New Zealand, though Sangakkara was surprised about not playing that game at home. "We were surprised when we learned that we will have to travel to Mumbai to play that game. I thought hosts play at home," he said. "Playing the New Zealand game is beyond our control. You can't change that now. That's gone now and we need to be up for the task."
20	505092		'Solidity of middle order has helped me and Kumar'	Mahela Jayawardene	March 10, 2011	'Chamara Silva's form is vital to Sri Lanka's chances'. AFP Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: Mahela Jayawardene | Chamara Silva Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Sri Lanka #p#It's been an exciting World Cup so far. At the beginning when people asked me to name the favourites, I had told them there is no clear favourite. And now we know why! Any of the top teams can win this. There have been surprises like Ireland beating England ; we always knew there will be one or two games like that. Netherlands played couple of good games. But because of the format we knew that if the big teams play some good cricket, they will get through. #p#We played Australia last and took a lot of positives out of that game. They are a strong and competitive side and to have the game under control at the point when the rains came down was a good thing. Weather is not under our control and so there is no point worrying about it; we got a point from it and we need to concentrate on the next game. #p#We have told the youngsters to take one game at a time, not worry about what's gone and just enjoy the World Cup. We normally take a couple of days off after playing a game and regroup for the next. We try to give small goals to the players which help them a lot. #p#There have been some murmurs about our openers' form. Both have been hitting the ball well and gave us a good start in couple of games. They didn't provide us with a good one against Australia but such things are always going to happen. The only thing we want from them is to spend more time in the middle and bat longer; the runs will come automatically. #p#I am confident about the way I am batting. I started off with a hundred, didn't bat against Kenya, got a very good ball from Shoaib Akhtar and was batting well against Australia when that run-out happened. I have to make sure I make a difference in the big games. #p#The solidity of the middle order has helped me and Kumar Sangakkara bat freely at the top of the order. Thilan Samaraweera is a perfect fit at No.5 and he has a burning desire to excel at that position. He calms the nerves and settles the middle order with his solidity. #p#Chamara Silva comes next and we are happy to have him in the groove. His sister passed away at the beginning of the tournament and he had to go away. When he came back, we asked him how he was feeling and started to slowly ease him back into play. The first game he played was a tough one, against Pakistan, and though he started slowly, he started looking good by the end. His form is vital to our chances. He has loads of experience and had a great last World Cup. If he can continue batting well, it will give more freedom to Kumar and other batsmen batting higher up. We are happy to have him back in the team. The batting line-up looks good with Thilan, Silva and Angelo Mathews batting in the lower middle-order. #p#We went with a spin-heavy attack in the last game against Australia but it all depends on the conditions and the opposition. We are lucky to have bowlers with different skills, in spin and pace, and we can mix and match according to our strategy. Nuwan Kulasekara, who missed the game against Australia, is a fine, shrewd bowler who will play a big part in our campaign. It was just in that game, on that pitch, we felt it would be better to play an extra spinner. #p#We play Zimbabwe next; they are a good side and we can't be complacent. We have to remain positive and execute our plans.
21	504394	England v South Africa, World Cup 2011, Group B, Chennai	Can England restore their pride?	The Preview by Andrew McGlashan	March 5, 2011	#p#Match Facts March 6, Chennai Start time 9.30am (0400 GMT) #p#James Anderson has struggled throughout the World Cup Associated Press Enlarge Related Links News : 'We're good at bouncing back' - Strauss Features : England bank on recent head-to-head record Players/Officials: Ravi Bopara | Johan Botha | Imran Tahir | Kevin Pietersen Matches: England v South Africa at Chennai Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: England | South Africa #p#The Big Picture #p#There have been plenty of mismatches so far in this World Cup, but whenever England have taken the field something extraordinary has occurred. Firstly Netherlands pushed them close, then there was the epic tie against India before they were humbled by Kevin O'Brien's stunning hitting. What happens next is anyone's guess, but matches against South Africa are rarely dull affairs. #p#It's not quite do-or-die for England but it's getting close after they reached the half-way point of their group campaign with three points instead of the expected four. Two wins should take them into the quarter-finals, but that's not an easy task with Bangladesh and West Indies to follow this game. South Africa have far fewer concerns after two clinical victories set up their campaign nicely. #p#As with every meeting between these two teams there will be the pre-match talk of England's contingent from South Africa. Kevin Pietersen has often lifted his game against the country of his birth, but South Africa have yet to see the best of Jonathan Trott. Despite the strong performances from England's top order there are still issues over the batting, both in terms of soft dismissals like Pietersen's against Ireland and the lack of impact from the middle order which twice cost them dear in Bangalore. #p#They will be up against the most rounded attack of the tournament. The threat of Dale Steyn and Morne Morkel was well known, but the inclusion of Imran Tahir has given South Africa an additional edge. Not that they are short on batting, either, and AB de Villiers has started the World Cup with back-to-back hundreds; the one against West Indies was elegant, the ton against Netherlands brutal. #p#Under Andrew Strauss and Andy Flower, England have shown an ability to bounce back following shocking defeats. Often the sight of formidable opponents focuses their mind in the way that being favourites against the likes of Netherlands and Ireland doesn't. However, all aspects of their game will have to fire on the same occasion - which it hasn't at any stage of the tournament - otherwise an early flight home will be an even greater possibility. #p#Form guide (completed matches, most recent first) England LTWLL South Africa WWWWL #p#Watch out for... #p#Although Steyn and Morkel form the best new-ball pair in the world, it's Imran Tahir that England need to watch out for. He was held back by South Africa as a surprise weapon for the World Cup and so far it has worked perfectly. He started with a match-winning 4 for 41 against West Indies and helped himself to some cheap scalps against Netherlands. An attacking spin bowler, and especially a legspinner, is something South Africa have long lacked and Tahir is making a huge difference. England are better than they used to be against leg spin, and most of the batsmen will have seen Tahir in county cricket, but unlike previous occasions when facing South Africa it's about more than just seeing off the quicks. #p#Kevin Pietersen has looked in fine form during the tournament which makes his three innings of 39, 31 and 59 even more frustrating. His move to the top order was two-fold; to give England a brisk start and to allow Pietersen to build an innings. At the moment he's only doing half the job. His reverse-sweep against Paul Stirling was just one of many sloppy pieces of cricket England produced at the hands of Ireland and, as much as Pietersen may shrug it off as 'the way he plays', it's a waste of his immense talent to not be building hundreds in such favourable batting conditions. No better place to perform than at the against South Africa. #p#Team news #p#Pietersen, Graeme Swann and Paul Collingwood picked up niggles against Ireland but are expected to be fit. However, Collingwood's place could come under pressure from Ravi Bopara with England needing power in the their middle order or Michael Yardy could be replaced. James Anderson continues to struggle so Ajmal Shahzad is an option. #p#England (possible) 1 Andrew Strauss (capt), 2 Kevin Pietersen, 3 Jonathan Trott, 4 Ian Bell, 5 Paul Collingwood, 6 Ravi Bopara, 7 Matt Prior (wk), 8 Tim Bresnan, 9 Stuart Broad, 10 Graeme Swann, 11 James Anderson #p#Morne van Wyk was a surprise selection against Netherlands, prompted by the cloudy morning in Mohali, and ended up keeping wicket with de Villiers having strained his back. Johan Botha was left out against the Dutch but his experience could be useful against England and he may be preferred to Robin Petersen. #p#South Africa (possible) 1 Graeme Smith (capt), 2 Hashim Amla, 3 Jacques Kallis, 4 AB de Villiers (wk), 5 JP Duminy, 6 Morne van Wyk, 7 Francois du Plessis, 8 Johan Botha, 9 Dale Steyn, 10 Morne Morkel, 11 Imran Tahir #p#Stats and trivia #p#The last time these two sides met in one-day cricket England secured their first series win on South African soil with a 2-1 success in 2009-10. #p#South Africa knocked Michael Vaughan's team out of the 2007 World Cup with a crushing nine-wicket victory in the Super Eight clash in Barbados after England were skittled for 154. #p#Graeme Smith hasn't scored an ODI century for 23 innings #p#Quotes #p#"The Ireland game would have hurt them a lot.

21	504397	England v South Africa, Group B, World Cup 2011, Chennai	Smith expecting England backlash	Firdose Moonda in Chennai	March 5, 2011	#p#While Graeme Smith, the South Africa captain, was waxing lyrical about the merits of having a varied bowling attack and the advantage of an attacking spinner, an abrupt sound silenced him. It was an electronic sheep bleeting its way out of someone's cellphone. #p#"Well, that's just beautiful," Smith said before guffawing in his usual meaty fashion. If he'd been gearing up for a match against Australia, it may have been considered sabotage instead of a big joke, but with Smith's new, relaxed attitude, there's a good chance it wouldn't have fazed him even then. Smith hardly moved a muscle in anger when he was asked about South Africa's first real test of the World Cup. #p#"England and South Africa is always a big game, it's always been competitive," Smith said. "I expect tomorrow to be no different." #p#After brushing aside West Indies and Netherlands, both of whom South Africa had lengthy unbeaten records against, they now face an England side that has beaten them in seven of the last eight completed one-day matches between the two teams, including in a series in South Africa. Smith refused to read too much into that bit of history, saying the reason for England's success against his men was really, quite obvious. "They played better than us in those eight games." #p#Since England last played South Africa, they have lost almost as many one-day games as they've won - losing 12 and winning 14. They notched up series wins against Bangladesh, Australia and Pakistan but much of the good work was undone when they crashed to a 6-1 defeat in the post-Ashes one-day series in Australia, and have yet to settle at this World Cup. "They are a very proud team; they've had some really good ups in the last two years and their performances have been credible over the last while," Smith said. #p#More pressingly for England, they've just come off the event's first upset: a three-wicket loss to their little brothers Ireland and although they don't have the same instincts that scream 'backlash' like Australia do, they'll still feel as though they have something to prove. That something could come against the team they knocked out of the 2009 Champions Trophy. #p#Graeme Smith has not scored a one-day century since September 2009 Associated Press Enlarge #p#Smith was aware England would be determined to fight back. "The Ireland game would have hurt them a lot. It was terrific for the spirit of the World Cup but they will be looking to bounce back." This was not a man bracing for a backlash, it was a man who had anticipated it and who knew it was coming. #p#There's always been a psychological element to matches between these teams, intensified by the number of South African-born players in the England side. While that story has become old, with Smith saying it was "about the fiftieth time I've had to answer that question," he did say South Africa would try to capitalise on whatever mental frailties conceding 959 runs in three matches may have caused in England's bowlers. "Maybe we can take advantage of that lack of confidence," Smith said, referring specifically to the opening pair of James Anderson and Stuart Broad. #p#Smith and Hashim Amla will be the two batsmen best placed to hurt Anderson and Broad, but Smith has problems of his own. In his last 23 one-day innings, he has not scored a century and while he has a 92 and a 77 under his belt against Pakistan and India respectively, he has looked awkward in the tournament so far. "I've got starts in all the warm-up games, and it will be nice to turn one of those into a big score." That was all he was willing to say, preferring to steer away from analysis of individuals and concentrate on the group. #p#South Africa have the advantage of having been in Chennai just three weeks ago. It was the first stop on their tour and the place where the World Cup preparations started. Smith said he was looking forward to the warmer climate. "Being in Chennai is more like the real India, the warmth, after coming from the cold." Delhi and Chandigarh, where South Africa played their first two matches of the tournament, had temperatures hovering between 20 and 25 degrees while Chennai was topping 35. #p#India is also a place where South Africa have been more successful than England, winning seven out of 13 matches to England's six out of 23 in the last ten years. That may not be on either captain's mind going into the match, but it may be something they can keep in the bank for next time.
21	504402	England v South Africa, Group B, World Cup 2011, Chennai	England bank on recent head-to-head record	S Rajesh	March 5, 2011	Not quite top stuff: Dale Steyn has taken four wickets in eight ODIs at an average of 88.25 and an economy rate of 6.41 against England AFP Enlarge Related Links Preview : Can England restore their pride? Players/Officials: James Anderson | Jacques Kallis | Kevin Pietersen | Dale Steyn Matches: England v South Africa at Chennai Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: England | South Africa #p#South Africa go in to Sunday's match against England as overwhelming favourites, which is as it should be given the form of the two teams in the tournament. However, Graeme Smith and Co will be wary of the fact that England have given them problems in bilateral ODI series in the recent past, winning the last two: 4-0 in 2008, and 2-1 in 2009-10. Thanks to those results, England are one of only three sides to have won more games than they've lost against South Africa since 2000; Australia and Sri Lanka are the others. #p#Those are some stats that will cheer England, but they don't have much else going their way - they've been poor with the ball, struggling to contain even the Associate teams, and their recent World Cup record against South Africa isn't so good either. After beating them twice in 1992 - including the semi-final - England have lost in 1996 (78 runs), 1999 (122 runs) and 2007 (nine wickets). Five of England's current top-order batsmen were in that side which was bundled out for 154 by South Africa's fast bowlers in Barbados in 2007. Andrew Strauss (46), Paul Collingwood (30) and Ravi Bopara (27 not out) offered some resistance, but Graeme Smith (89 not out from 58 balls) and AB de Villiers (42 from 35) blazed past that target in less than 20 overs. #p#England have also lost both times in the subcontinent - South Africa beat them in the 1996 World Cup in Rawalpindi and in the 1998 Champions Trophy in Dhaka - but Sunday's game will be the first between the two teams in India. #p#England v South Africa in ODIs ODIs Eng won SA won Overall 44 18 23 Since 2000 26 12 11 In World Cups 5 2 3 #p#South Africa's batsmen have had it all their way in two matches so far, averaging 6.18 runs per over. Most of their top batsmen have excellent records in India, but some of them haven't done so well against England. Jacques Kallis, in particular, has a disappointing record against them, averaging less than 33 in 37 innings, with only one century. Similarly de Villiers hasn't done too well in his 14 matches, but the recent form of all these players has been quite terrific, which is what will give the team the most confidence. #p#South African batsmen v England, and in India Batsman v Eng - ODIs Average Strike rate in India - ODIs Average Strike rate Jacques Kallis 37 32.46 65.34 17 50.08 74.75 Graeme Smith 18 45.43 87.80 10 38.33 84.97 AB de Villiers 14 25.00 79.07 10 86.14 107.10 Hashim Amla 6 237 47.40 4 62.00 91.85 JP Duminy 9 141 17.62 3 41.00 118.84 #p#Among England's batsmen, Kevin Pietersen has been the stand-out name with an outstanding record against South Africa, and in India. His recent record doesn't inspire as much confidence, though, despite a couple of promising innings in the World Cup so far: in his last 25 innings since the beginning of 2009, he averages 23.96, with only two half-centuries. Strauss, Jonathan Trott, Bell and Collingwood have all done much better. (Click here for the records of all England batsmen since January 2009.) #p#England batsmen v South Africa, and in India Batsman v SA - ODIs Average Strike rate in India - ODIs Average Strike rate Kevin Pietersen 16 71.55 101.09 16 54.50 91.70 Paul Collingwood 16 40.60 85.47 23 30.05 78.97 Andrew Strauss 12 22.45 65.51 12 51.81 85.71 Ian Bell 10 30.33 67.91 12 36.83 80.07 Jonathan Trott 3 74.00 70.47 3 56.67 96.59 #p#Like South Africa's top batsman, their top bowler has also performed quite poorly against England: in eight ODIs against them, Dale Steyn has taken a mere four wickets, averaging 88.25 runs per wicket, and 6.41 runs per over. It's easily his poorest display against any team. #p#If South Africa's best fast bowler has struggled against England, then England's top fast man has found the going extremely tough in India. James Anderson concedes more than 57 runs per wicket in India, and has only managed two scalps in his last eight innings in the country. Graeme Swann has been more successful at taking wickets, and he'll probably again be a key member of the England bowling attack on Sunday. #p#The venue for this day game is the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai, a venue which has hosted only five such matches in the past. One of them was the World Cup game between New Zealand and Kenya, in which Kenya were bundled out for 69. The last day game before that match was way back in 1994. #p#Since 2000, Chennai have only hosted six completed ODIs, which means there isn't much data to look at trends. In those six games, four have been won by the team chasing, with teams averaging 5.35 runs per over when batting first, and 5.89 in the second innings. There isn't a whole lot to choose between the performances of fast bowlers and spinners either, in those games: spin has averaged 31.31 at an economy rate of 5.17, and fast bowlers have managed an average of 29.17 at an economy rate of 5.53.

Even in the midst of being questioned, over and over again, about the weakness of his bowling attack, Strauss smiled and explained, answering each question thoughtfully. Even in the midst of being told he was the leader of a failed fielding side, Strauss kept his cool and spoke with the same even-tone throughout. That's class. #p#"I've learnt that if you bowl and field poorly, there's a good chance you will lose games of cricket," he said when asked what he'd been mulling over in the past few days. "There are going to be high-scoring games and if there is any slight edge you get in the field, will stand you in good stead." #p#He had accepted that the performance while bowling was up to no good but admitted that this attack wasn't helped by the pitch in Bangalore, where it conceded two scores over 300. "When you come across a very flat wicket, the margin of error goes down and that's why we haven't quite been able to do what we want to do." #p#The Chennai pitch is a different beast. It's not the liveliest but Strauss's assessment of it is that it will offer a little more. "The wicket looks grassless, hard and dry. There will be something in it for at least some of the bowlers." #p#Andrew Strauss expects more for the bowlers on the Chennai track AFP Enlarge #p#It's taking whatever there is and making it work for them that may present England with a challenge. Barring Graeme Swann, the rest of their attack has looked ordinary and, at times, purposeless. But Strauss added that the bowlers have "a lot of clarity" about what they need to do, and they will prove that against South Africa. "We will bowl to our plans against them. We know their players pretty well, it's not like we will get any surprise packages." #p#South Africa and England last played a one-day series in the 2009-10 season in South Africa, where the hosts were beaten. James Anderson and Stuart Broad were the two leading bowlers in that series, taking eight and six wickets respectively. They also played a series in 2008 in England, who were winners this time, too. Broad was the second highest wicket-taker, with eight scalps. It's not just the familiarity of the South African team that Strauss is talking about but the familiarity of beating them. For two bowlers who seem horribly out of it at the moment, Anderson and Broad, it's the familiarity of taking wickets against them. #p#South Africa's middle order has been untested at this World Cup and Strauss sees that as an opportunity to get his bowlers back in the groove. With Hashim Amla and AB de Villiers dominating time at the crease, the likes of Faf du Plessis and whoever will fill that troublesome No.7 spot have not had much match time. As a result of that, "maybe the middle order hasn't got the pace of the wicket very well," Strauss said. Scoring runs hasn't been much of a problem for England so far and they won't be thrown off if South African's mystery man, Imran Tahir, plays, because most of the England batsmen have seen him on the county circuit. "When he first came to England I played with him at Middlesex," Strauss said. "I have since played against him. The guys from Warwickshire also know him well. We know what he brings to the party quite clearly." #p#What's just as lucid to the England side is how crucial it will be for them to recover, and recover quickly enough to launch an immediate challenge against the rampant South African side, "You've got to put defeats behind you very quickly. The great thing about this tournament is that you have the opportunity to get back on the bike straight away." Strauss said. Then, with a half a grin and a quiet confidence that never let his class slip for a second he added. "We're good at bouncing back."

Players/Officials: Hashim Amla | Ravi Bopara | Stuart Broad | Imran Tahir | Dale Steyn | Graeme Swann | Jonathan Trott Matches: England v South Africa at Chennai Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: England | South Africa #p#What a World Cup England are producing. From a thrilling tie against India to the shock of losing to Ireland they have now conjured a stunning fightback to <m9>beat South Africa by six runs in a gripping contest on a tough pitch in Chennai</m9>. <m10>They took all ten wickets for 165</m10> through a combination of spin, reverse swing, perseverance and the never-say-die-attitude which is such a trait of this team, with <m11>Stuart Broad sealing the victory with two wickets in four balls</m11> after <m12>Dale Steyn's 31-ball 20</m12> had taken his team close to the winning line. #p#It showed you don't need 600 runs to create an epic one-day international and the celebrations <m13>when Morne Morkel was caught behind</m13> proved how important it was for England spirits. Without it they would have faced the real possibility of heading home early, but can now approach the clashes against Bangladesh and West Indies with much greater heart. What will please Andrew Strauss and Andy Flower is that it was the much-maligned attack that won the match - after the batting struggled to post 171 - as <m14>Broad took 4 for 15</m14>, James Anderson produced a devastating burst of reverse swing shortly before the 34-over ball change and Graeme Swann bowled with guile and craft to set up the prospect of victory. #p#Despite the tricky pitch, South Africa had broken the back of the run-chase after <m15>an opening stand of 63 between Graeme Smith and Hashim Amla</m15>. However, they suffered two slumps; <m16>the first as three wickets fell for 19</m16> - <m17>with Broad claiming the vital scalps of Amla and Jacques Kallis</m17> - then the more significant slide from <m18>124 for 3</m18> to <m19>165 all out</m19> as Anderson produced some wonderful reverse swing, <m20>Ian Bell pulled off a fine piece of fielding at short leg to run out Faf du Plessis</m20>, and Broad cleaned up the tail. #p#<m21>Swann could have dismissed Smith almost half a dozen times with spitting, turning deliveries until one finally bounced and brushed the thumb although it needed the DRS to overturn Asoka de Silva's on-field not out decision.</m21> <m22>Amla had moved along serenely despite the testing surface until he became a little lazy against Broad and chopped into his stumps.</m22> <m23>Kallis then edged a drive and, in a rare sight, accepted Prior's word on whether it had carried without asking for the umpires to check.</m23> #p#<m24>AB de Villiers, who began the tournament with back-to-back hundreds, and du Plessis are normally free-flowing batsman, but they decided to consolidate rather than attack during their 42-run stand.</m24> It wasn't a major problem for South Africa at the time with the asking rate remaining comfortable, but it conceded the momentum and when the breakthroughs came England still had runs to play with. #p#<m25>Anderson produced his finest spell of reverse-swing since the Ashes as he trimmed de Villiers' bails</m25> and <m26>then clattered JP Duminy's stumps</m26> two balls after <m27>he'd been reprieved by the DRS having been given caught down the leg side. It had been a controversial moment because there didn't seem enough evidence to overrule the on-field umpire, but Anderson soon made it irrelevant.</m27> In between those two wickets, <m28>Bell showed brilliant alertness at short leg as he stopped du Plessis's shot and flicked it to Prior in time to complete the run out</m28>. #p#Smart Stats. <m29>The 171</m29> is the ninth time England have been bowled out for less than 200 in World Cups. Their lowest remains the 93 against Australia in the 1975 World Cup semi-final. <m30>Imran Tahir's 4 for 38</m30> is his best bowling performance in ODIs surpassing his 4 for 41 in the game against West Indies. The bowling performance is also the second best by a spinner against England in a World Cup game behind Abdul Qadir's 4 for 31 in 1987. <m31>Robin Peterson's 3 for 22</m31> is his best bowling display in ODIs surpassing his 3 for 42 against Pakistan in Dubai. From a position of <m32>124 for 3</m32>, <m33>South Africa lost their next four wickets for an additional three runs including three wickets with the score on 124.</m33> <m34>Stuart Broad's 4 for 15</m34> is the best bowling performance by an England bowler in World Cup matches against South Africa and the seventh best by an English bowler overall in World Cups. <m35>The 99-run stand between Jonathan Trott and Ravi Bopara</m35> is the second highest for the fourth wicket for England in World Cups. <m36>Trott continued his excellent ODI form with his ninth half-century</m36>. He has now scored 1080 runs in 22 matches at an average of 54. <m37>England's six-run win</m37> is their closest margin of victory in a World Cup match when thry have batted first. Their previous closest win was the nine-run win over India in the 1992 World Cup. The 172 is the lowest target that South Africa have failed to chase in World Cups and the third lowest in ODIs. #p#<m38>England were buzzing, having taken 3 for 0</m38>, and the scoring remained at a standstill for the next three overs as Morne van Wyk and Robin Peterson struggled against spin. <m39>Michael Yardy, the weak link in the attack, then had Peterson caught behind trying to cut</m39> but <m40>the mandatory ball-change at 34 overs</m40> meant the threat of reverse swing was momentarily removed. #p#Andrew Strauss opted to keep Swann back for one over and used Yardy and Kevin Pietersen in tandem. Both were given one over too many as <m41>Steyn took advantage, driving Yardy through the covers</m41> and <m42>lofting Pietersen straight down the ground</m42>. Slowly but surely <m43>he and van Wyk chipped out 33 tension-filled runs</m43>. #p#However, because of the extensive use of the spinners Strauss was able to return to his quicks at the death and <m44>with 12 needed Tim Bresnan found van Wyk's inside-edge which crashed into the stumps</m44>. Then <m45>it was over to Broad who trapped Steyn lbw with his first ball</m45> and <m46>Morkel had clearly decided to try and finish the game quickly when he got the final edge</m46>. #p#Despite proving to be yet another thriller, the match could not have been a greater contrast to the two run-fests England were involved in Bangalore. It became abundantly clear this wouldn't be a 300-match when <m47>Peterson stunned everyone by removing both openers in his first over</m47>. The value of South Africa's rounded attack was again on show as the frontline spinners took seven wickets and were backed up by Morkel and Steyn with <m48>England losing their top three for 15</m48> and <m49>last six for 37</m49>, but their failure to cross the line will raise old concerns. #p#Smith isn't known for out-of-the-box captaincy but it was clever to hand Peterson the new ball. <m50>Strauss tried to take an attacking approach by using his feet, but could only pick out de Villiers, who took a fine running catch at deep midwicket.</m50> If that was a bonus for South Africa they could barely believe what happened three balls later when <m51>Pietersen pushed forward and got a regulation edge low to first slip.</m51> <m52>Bell soon became Peterson's third as he pushed a return catch back to the bowler after being beaten in the flight.</m52> #p#<m53>Ravi Bopara, back in the side at the expense of Paul Collingwood, set about the recovery with Jonathan Trott</m53>, <m54>who was saved by the DRS after being given lbw against Imran Tahir on 20</m54>. <m55>Bopara nearly ran himself out on 26 - it wouldn't have been the first time - but a dive just saved him</m55>, then he broke a run of singles with <m56>a handsome straight drive for six</m56> before <m57>Trott reached fifty from 87 balls.</m57> #p#Having used up considerable time Trott needed to up the tempo but <m58>Tahir pulled off a fine return catch after deceiving his former Warwickshire team-mate in the flight</m58>. <m59>Prior had the chance to build an innings after previously needing to slog from the start but was undone by Morkel</m59>. #p#<m60>Bopara's 60</m60>, his first ODI fifty since November 2008, remained the top score and will have given him huge confidence for the rest of the tournament as he showed he could adapt to conditions. The lower order couldn't build momentum against Tahir and failing to use up 26 deliveries looked like being costly. However, once again England dug deep when all seemed lost and gave the World Cup another memorable finish. #p#Match Timeline
21	504526	England v South Africa, Group B, World Cup 2011, Chennai	Spin starts the clatter of wickets, seam seals it	Firdose Moonda at Chennai	March 6, 2011	Stuart Broad stunned South Africa with two late strikes. Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: Hashim Amla | Ravi Bopara | Stuart Broad | Imran Tahir | Robin Peterson | Dale Steyn | Graeme Swann | Jonathan Trott Matches: England v South Africa at Chennai Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: England | South Africa #p#The gamble. After Johan Botha successfully opened the bowling against West Indies, Graeme Smith decided he would roll the dice in that direction again. This time, it was with Robin Peterson. There was some logic to having Peterson open given the other Pietersen - Kevin - has such a renowned weakness against left-arm spin, but the plan worked better than Smith could ever have hoped. <m1>With his third ball, he lured England's captain into a carefully created trap. Andrew Strauss launched it high, long-on galloped, plucked and Peterson erupted.</m1> It was the start of a magic spell for him. #p#The bobbling ball. Imran Tahir was without a wicket and returned for his second spell - which has proved to be his wicket-taking one throughout this tournament. He unleashed the googly immediately and when that didn't work he went for the full toss. <m2>Trott gave it everything, only to watch Dale Steyn make good ground in the deep. He had the ball in his grasp, but only until his forearms hit the ground. As they made contact, the ball spilled out on the grass and the chance was lost.</m2> #p#The wonder-delivery. <m3>Imran Tahir has so many different balls in his repertoire, it's tough to pick a favourite but in this match it must surely have been his googly. Not just any googly, but the one that got Stuart Broad. It took some courage to bowl it at the length he did to a left-hander. Tahir pitched it on leg stump and replays showed it was hitting the top of off.</m3> #p#The walker. <m4>Jacques Kallis added a touch of good old-fashioned sportsmanship when he relied on Matt Prior's honesty to see if he was out. Kallis chased a Broad delivery that he should have left alone and got a small nick. It died on Prior who took the catch low down and there was some doubt if it carried. While Broad was pointing wildly at the floor and Prior, Kallis simply asked Prior if he had caught it cleanly. When the wicket-keeper said yes, Kallis walked off the field, the second time he has done so at this World Cup.</m4> #p#The incredible end. As the advantage changed hands quicker than black-market money, it was Broad who made the difference. Back to top form after the stomach ailment that interrupted his campaign, <m5>Broad removed South African's two quicks, Steyn and Morne Morkel</m5>. <m6>Both went to full balls, Steyn struck flush on the pad</m6> and <m7>Morkel nicked off while attempting a booming drive.</m7> Two bowlers had been undone by one of their own.
21	504562	England v South Africa, Group B, World Cup 2011, Chennai	A pitch of which a Test match would be proud	Firdose Moonda at Chennai	March 6, 2011	#p#With three men around the bat, Graeme Swann turning it square on a crumbling pitch and two lower-middle order batsmen fighting to survive, it could have been the final, deciding session of a Test match. A sight so pleasing to a cricket connoisseur's eye is not often on show in one-day cricket. It's the format for flat pitches and high run-chases, where the batsmen's fluency and the bowler's accuracy are usually the two elements of competition. #p#It's rare that there is, in the space and time that a one-day match allows, an innings can be built from the ground up as a batsman is tested against bowlers baying for blood on a pitch that is offering something for them to bait with. It's rare that those who use spin, not merely slower bowling on helpful tracks, and reverse swing to trap their prey are able to show the beauty of their trade in those 100 overs that make up the ODI. Rare things are always valuable, but just how valuable is only apparent when they are on display. #p#The Chennai pitch was the stage for such a performance. It was dry, crusty and rough, as unwelcoming for batsmen as a cold, sniping wind on a frosty day. There would be turn - that was evident <m1>from ball one when Robin Peterson, whose ability to spin the ball is often laughed at in his home country - did just that.</m1> There would be reverse swing, as James Anderson, searching for redemption after the totals England conceded in their first three matches, showed with such aplomb. What there wouldn't be were easy runs and that meant a low-scoring tussle, which produced a set of skills that don't often have to be on display in this format. #p#"There was a lot on offer for bowlers: reverse swing, spin, bounce. It was a bowler's day," Graeme Smith said. Andrew Strauss and the two batsmen who followed him back to the changeroom, Kevin Pietersen and Ian Bell, were walking illustrations of that. <m2>Strauss fell trying to play a glory shot, having faced just three balls before that.</m2> Had he waited a little before doing that he would have seen that, in this case, the best form of attack was defence. #p#<m3>Pietersen's problems against left-arm spin stem from things beyond the pitch</m3>, but <m4>Bell went the same route</m4>. <m5>Peterson's catch off his own bowling was the work of an adrenaline-fuelled man at the peak of his confidence, but Bell's mistimed attempt at a drive was not the kind of shot that would enable success on this surface.</m5> Ravi Bopara and Jonathan Trott's innings were better examples of how to craft a knock on a tricky surface. #p#<m6>Hashim Amla showed the necessary patience for a tough surface, but his dismissal left too much for the tail to cope with</m6>. Getty Images Enlarge #p#Timing and placement were the building blocks of their strokes. Both of them scored slightly more on the leg side, with deft flicks and guides around the corner, and although they unleashed a few cuts and <m7>Bopara had one, glorious cover-drive</m7>, most of their runs came from nudges, pushes and playing with soft hands. Patience was their stand-out characteristic, as runs had to be worked for and did not just present themselves. "On a flat pitch we would have looked to score a run a ball, but that would have been really difficult on this pitch and you have to realise that early doors," Bopara said. #p#Once <m8>the pair</m8> had left, the rest of the England batsman were incapable of transcending the conditions. Inconsistent bounce, which made Morne Morkel dangerous, and turn, which Imran Tahir manipulated like putty in his hands to bowl googly after googly, saw England exit for a score that was, despite evidence to the contrary from South Africa, chaseable. Not easily chaseable, but with more of the Bopara-like approach, patiently chaseable. #p#<m9>The first 15 overs of South Africa's reply</m9> may even have vindicated that statement, when the sheer numbers are taken into account. <m10>A third of the target had been ticked off, at 68 for 1</m10>, and with time on their side, South Africa should have, from a purely statistical perspective, cantered home. The action spun a different tale, however. <m11>Graeme Swann, who was spinning as incessantly as a nauseating ride at an amusement park, had Smith feeling like he was on one. The South Africa captain was unsettled and scratchy and it was only a matter of time before he gave way.</m11> #p#<m12>He opened a crack, the size of which Stuart Broad, who was bowling tight lines, wicket to wicket, could widen, as he did with the dismissal of Hashim Amla and Jacques Kallis.</m12> Swann was the architect and Yardy and Pietersen the apprentices but it was Anderson who was the master. He broke the back of the South African middle-order by twisting it out of joint as it couldn't cope with his swing. "They bowled really well with the reverse swing," Smith said. "There are many batters who have mastered the art of playing that." #p#Having batted on the pitch first and seeing the runs dry up, Strauss knew that that would be the way to go. "There was a lot of turn and bounce there. You need to ask questions of the batsmen and all credit to the bowlers for being able to do that for us. It's tough for the tailenders to come in when the ball is reversing or spinning." It was so tough that <m13>South Africa lost 7 for 41</m13>, compared to <m14>England's 6 for 58</m14>. #p#Although Strauss said the pitch, "broke up a bit too much," he stopped short of criticising it, because there probably wasn't much to fault it for. It didn't ask the same questions as one-day surfaces usually do, but difference should not be scorned at. It kept the intrigue of captaincy alive as bowlers were rotated quickly and it produced a thriller which tested areas of the game that are not usually up for scrutiny in such a match. As Strauss put it, these kind of pitches, "sometimes make for good, entertaining cricket."
21	504563	England v South Africa, Group B, World Cup 2011, Chennai	South Africa's marshmallow syndrome	Firdose Moonda at Chennai	March 6, 2011	Squashed, singed and beaten: South Africa's middle order couldn't take the heat. Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Audio/Video: Graeme Smith: England stuck to their guns well. Players/Officials: Faf du Plessis | Imran Tahir | Robin Peterson | Dale Steyn | Morne van Wyk Matches: England v South Africa at Chennai Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: England | South Africa #p#A marshmallow has many redeeming qualities. It's sweet and light and fluffy and tastes as good dipped in chocolate as it does chargrilled over a flame. That it can so easily get burnt is one of its shortcomings. #p#Marshmallows can't withstand. Trap them in a clenched fist and they're soon squashed. Heat them up and they become gooey and pliable. In other words, place them in a situation of pressure and they're likely to become unrecognisable, a little like the South African middle order. #p#"It's the first outing they've had for a long time," Graeme Smith said at the post-match press conference. A forgetful outing it was, as <m1>seven wickets tumbled for 41 runs</m1>, and the flames of spin, swing and attacking bowling them burnt them beyond recognition. Once the top four were gone, they panicked, like <m2>Faf du Plessis, who called for a run that simply wasn't there</m2>; they were outclassed, like <m3>JP Duminy, who has no answers for James Anderson's accuracy</m3>, and they couldn't settle like Robin Peterson, who looked like getting out from just about the first ball he faced. #p#<m4>Morne van Wyk, a first-class campaigner of 16 seasons, showed a certain composure and maturity to combine with Dale Steyn and then also played a shot in anger - only to play it onto his own stumps.</m4> It left Steyn and Morne Morkel, both proficient with the bat, with a simple enough task to complete, but one that was made difficult because of the carnage they'd seen before them. If batsmen at positions five, six, seven and eight had been squashed, what chance did they have? #p#This middle order, particularly from No. 6 downwards, has not spent any time at the crease in this World Cup, so it's only natural that they would need a period of adjustment. Maybe that period would mean scoring slowly, trying to make sense of the conditions and work out to play on them. Maybe it meant one or two of them perishing in the cause. On a bowler-friendly Chennai surface, they had no such luxury. #p#Conditions favoured the bowlers and even though patience would have been rewarded, the pace of the game at the stage when they entered it demanded a quick adjustment and an immediate plan to shut out the pressure. Such a plan can only be executed with confidence, and confidence will only come with time in the middle, time that they have not had. It's too early to panic though, according to Smith. "We need to show a little bit more faith in them rather than to just give them one go." #p#No, it's not fair to call them melting marshmallows after one collapse. There Smith is correct. Where he isn't, however, is that it hasn't been just one. In the last seven ODIs, there have been three collapses, two while chasing. One of them was today. The other two came against India, South Africa's next opponents in this tournament. Munaf Patel was the man who made it happen both times. He took 4 for 29 in Johannesburg, when South Africa watched seven wickets fall for 29 runs and lost the match by one run. His 2 for 42 was part of a collapse in which South Africa lost 5 for 20 and crashed from 200 for 5 to 220 all out. #p#It's positions six, seven and eight that are most problematic. This time, they were the domain of Duminy and van Wyk, but Peterson, Johan Botha, Wayne Parnell and Colin Ingram have all been tried, in different combinations, to fill the slot, none with enough success to last. It presents South Africa with a puzzle they haven't had to solve too many times in the past - with the likes of Mark Boucher and Lance Klusener lurking at No. 7 to steady or surge as needed. #p#These days there is something less solid than the two mentioned above, and it doesn't look like South Africa are anywhere closer to hardening it up. "I thought <m5>Faf and Ab hung in really well</m5>. If they could have hung in a few more overs, we could have got home. That was a crucial part of the game," Smith said when asked about the middle order, not making any reference to the batsmen who come after du Plessis, who was pushed up to No. 5. #p#Inexperience is what undid du Plessis, while Duminy has yet to find a sustained period of form that made him a superstar against Australia three seasons ago. An extended run for van Wyk may turn him into the dependable man South Africa need in that position and if Botha comes back into the starting XI, he may provide stability and security in the lower middle order. Until then, it's going to remain a cluster of talented players, the kind that look good if their job is to build on what the top order has created but who can still get singed when the heat is really on.
21	504567	England v South Africa, Group B, World Cup 2011, Chennai	Mercurial England spring back to life	Andrew Miller	March 6, 2011	#p#The logic of England's World Cup campaign veers once again towards the ludicrous. Four agonisingly enthralling fixtures have resulted in a victory that deserved to be a defeat, a tie that should have been a victory, a defeat that no-one could believe was not a victory, and now <m1>a victory that was snatched from the jaws of defeat</m1>. The tombola of emotions that their campaign has inspired has been responsible for roughly 70% of the interest in the whole of the 2011 World Cup. But this time, surely, they've done enough to end the immediate uncertainty, and guarantee their progression through to the last eight. #p#It has been, however, a devastatingly close-run thing, every bit as marginal as the eight runs out of 2256 that have enabled them to cling onto their positive Net Run Rate. But regardless of all that, for a short time on Sunday afternoon, while India were still working on their run-chase in Bangalore, England sat healthily at the top of the Group B table, looking at last like the big-cheese team they were always meant to be in this competition. #p#"This puts us back on track in the World Cup and it couldn't come a day too soon," said England's relieved captain, Andrew Strauss. "It was a cliffhanger of a game, we're certainly keeping people interested at the moment, but we're delighted with <m2>the win</m2> and we have high hopes of achieving a great thing. We still need to learn some lessons, but we got away with <m3>a win</m3> and a win is all you need to kick-start things and get it going." #p#All the same, had South Africa's tail managed to cobble together six more singles from the 14 deliveries left at their disposal, England would have slunk to a lowly and precarious fourth in Group B, with their forthcoming trip to Chittagong infused with the peculiar dread that has paralysed them in each of their games against supposedly lesser teams. But in a contest that reverted to a Test-match scenario from the moment <m4>Graeme Swann ripped a beauty past Graeme Smith's edge to confirm the treachery in the wicket</m4>, a long-suppressed knowhow flooded back into England's game. #p#Stuart Broad and James Anderson's recovery from personal lows to deliver a match-winning performance has boosted England's campaign. Getty Images Enlarge #p#Suddenly an attack that had been flogged at seven runs an over in the opening fortnight made a run every other ball look like riches. Giving absolutely nothing away had been the secret of their glory in the Ashes, when the leaky Steven Finn was shelved after Perth to be replaced by Tim Bresnan, and that same policy proved impeccable in another fraught and thrilling scenario. Strauss, whose tactics have erred in previous games in this campaign, played a limited hand to perfection, trusting his second-string spinners, Michael Yardy and Kevin Pietersen, to hold the fort at a time when the occasional loose ball would not be ruinous, before reverting to his gun bowlers and demanding they aim barrel-straight. #p#When pressed on the state of the wicket, Strauss admitted it had broken up too much to be ideal for a one-day international, but there's little doubt he was happier in these surroundings than had been the case back in Bangalore, on a belter of a pitch that may have allowed him to touch personal perfection during his 158 against India, but which blunted the bowlers that had previously turned England into one-day challengers. In the past decade, England have won only 50% of the 18 ODIs in which they have posted 300 or more , a statistic that underlines their unfamiliarity with such high-scoring jousts. #p#A dogfight is much more befitting this outfit. England are on their chinstraps as their never-ending winter moves into its sixth month, but there may yet be a method to their current madness. Adrenaline is one of many substances on WADA's listed of banned stimulants, but there's nothing in the rules that says you can't create your own. By living on the edge, England are alive in the competition full-stop. And a month that had threatened to be as mundane as was the case back in 1996 (when England sleepwalked to the quarter-finals only to be rudely awoken by Sanath Jayasuriya and Sri Lanka) has been as overloaded with action thrillers as Tim Bresnan's DVD collection. #p#Adrenaline is one of many substances on WADA's listed of banned stimulants, but there's nothing in the rules that says you can't create your own. By living on the edge, England are alive in the competition full-stop. #p#It's stretching credibility to pretend it's all part of a cunning plan, but just as Pakistan have long been renowned for their ability to peak precisely when no-one expects it, so England are now firmly in that bracket - and no opponent in their right minds would wish to encounter either in the knockouts. Not so long ago, England's one-day cricket was universally condemned for being dull and one-dimensional, but when <m5>James Anderson (9.5-0-91-1)</m5> and <m6>Stuart Broad (9-0-73-0)</m6> can bounce back from personal nadirs to record combined figures of 12.4-0-31-6, such labels can safely be consigned to World Cup history. #p#England will know that improvements can and must be made. Paul Collingwood's form made his omission unavoidable, but on this evidence, Yardy might not keep him out forever, given that he lacks the strength to find the boundary on good decks and the versatility to work the singles on tough ones, as <m7>his 3 from 17 balls</m7> showed today. More worryingly, his left-arm spin is proving far too leaky on all surfaces - it's no good conceding six runs an over as standard in ODIs, even if 4-0-24-1 is an exceptional spell in a Twenty20 spell. Despite <m8>the vital wicket of South Africa's anchor tailender, Robin Peterson</m8>, he came as close to losing England the game as Swann, Broad and Anderson ultimately took them to winning it. #p#But overall, England's balance was vastly improved for this fixture, and beyond, thanks in no small part to the arrival of <m9>Ravi Bopara, whose Man-of-the-Match-winning 60</m9> provided a classy foil for England's Mr Consistent, <m10>Jonathan Trott, whose 52 from 94 balls</m10> was arguably his best innings of the tournament to date. The two came together at an invidious 15 for 3, with the onus on survival every bit as much as advancement. This was Test-match cricket, one-day style, and it was just what England needed to remind themselves how good they can be when their minds are forced to remain wholly and solely on the job.
21	504844		South Africa's new bogeymen	Rob Steen	March 9, 2011	James Anderson tormented the South African batsmen with McGrath-like accuracy. Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Matches: England v South Africa at Chennai Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: England | South Africa #p#Easy like Sunday morning, eh? Not likely Lionel, my dear old thing. Not if you were rubbing the sleep from your eyes in deepest Sussex, it wasn't. Not if you gave a hoot about what was happening in Chennai. And certainly not if your idea of easy is a bump-free ride with Handy Andy and his Mighty Erratics. #p#Some wildly extravagant claims were made on behalf of the previous Sunday's improbable 676-run Anglo-Indian all-squarer (how improbable can readily be gleaned, not so much from the fact that, of the 47 previous tied ODIs, just one had yielded more runs - 680 by New Zealand and England in Napier three years ago - but that the next highest aggregate had been 540). Inasmuch as England had two wickets intact as the penultimate ball was propelled, leaving all three results possible, it was tempting, admittedly, to rush headlong to such lavish conclusions, but this should have been resisted. #p#Sporting encounters require at least a vestige of balance to secure their own folder on one's inner hard drive, and cricket purists are arguably the hardest to please. Not only do we want both protagonists to have a chance of victory, we also want variety, which means batsmen and bowlers - and, ideally, seamers and spinners - must be on a reasonably level footing. And notwithstanding one magnificent late spell by Tim Bresnan and a similarly swift burst of equal magnitude by Zaheer Khan, which together accounted for roughly five of the 100 overs, that Bangalore bash was a clear knockout for the flat-track bullies, as is the way with far too many ODIs. Fortunately, courtesy of an unexpectedly chirpy Chennai strip, we witnessed something rather beautiful, something bearing a welcome resemblance to a proper game of cricket. #p#And about time too. Since the last World Cup, the spirit of adventure, stirred by Twenty20 and sweetened by the advent of the batting Powerplay, has seen the pendulum swing to an intolerable degree. Consider the following exhibits. From January 1971 until shortly before the 2006 Champions Trophy, the average ODI total was 209; over the past two years that mean has surged to just south of 253. Of the 51 scores of 350 or more in the 3122 ODIs played up to midnight on Monday, more than 60%, 33, had been slammed and slugged in 626 games since February 1, 2007, along with more than half, eight, of the 15 highest successful all-time chases. And while South Africa boast the highest overall run-rate with 4.93 per over, and 4.86 up to the start of the 2009 Champions Trophy, the first major event to deploy the batting Powerplay, all eight senior nations have exceeded 4.96 since then, seven of them 5.13 or better. A question, assuredly, of extreme imbalance. #p#That's why Chennai was such a vital and timely tonic for this tournament, not to say the flagging viability of the 50-over flog. In India, the batsmen had been gorging - unstoppably, nauseatingly; how many times in one day do you need to see fielders gazing forlornly into the distance? But now, glory be, came a banquet for the bowlers. Did the pendulum swing too far the other way? Not if drama and suspense are your bag. Forty-four percent of the one-wicket wins in ODIs (20 out of 45 as of Monday night) have involved targets of under 220; just over half of the one-run victories (13 out of 25) had seen the victors defend fewer than 230. Need we remind ourselves that the greatest World Cup match of all, the 1999 semi-final between Australia and South Africa, finished in a 213-213 tie? Gluttony does not necessarily beget nourishment. #p#Amid the rabid clamour for exotic strokeplay and DLF Maximums it is all too easy to confuse bowlers with waiters and busboys. That's why Chennai cheered the soul. Just over an hour elapsed between <m1>the last ball of the 32nd over, when Jimmy Anderson's McGrathian outswinger did for AB de Villiers</m1>, and <m2>the fourth ball of the 48th, when Morne Morkel wafted Stuart Broad to Matt Prior</m2>, sealing the outcome. Such was the tension, so uncertain the tide amid that don't-leave-your-seat, don't-blink passage, with fielders clustering the bat, boundaries a fanciful dream and swashers buckling, here was the climactic fifth day of a Test in all but name and kit. Cricket, in any language, at its best. #p#Yet at the risk of sounding ungrateful, something still nagged. We have a batting Powerplay, but why not a bowling one? OK, we do have one, but in name only: all the fielding side are actually permitted to do is invite the opposition to rack up even more runs on the cheap. Why not offer a five-over option during which the fielding captain can toss the ball to whomever he sees fit, even if they have already completed their allocation? Every major regulation change in recent memory has been devised to benefit batsmen; isn't about time some crumbs were thrown to the bowlers? #p#THE MOST INTRIGUING aspect of that Chennai cheerer was the way it continued a remarkable and unexpected trend. In their last 18 meetings with South Africa in all formats, beginning with the 2008 Oval Test in 2008, England, having failed to win even one of the nations' 10 previous duels, have prevailed three times as often as they've lost (12 to four). In ODIs alone, the score is 8-1 - again, no small feat given that they'd lost the previous five. Of South Africa's other 80 international fixtures during that span, 55 have been won and 21 lost. Prima facie evidence, you would imagine, of a budding hoodoo. But to what can we attribute this extraordinary shift? For the first 15 years after South Africa returned from isolation their bogeymen were scions of Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and Sydney. Now they hail from Burnley, Nottingham, Northampton and Gateshead. I can think of more unlikely regime changes, but not many #p#For the first 15 years after South Africa returned from isolation their bogeymen were scions of Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and Sydney. Now they hail from Burnley, Nottingham, Northampton and Gateshead. I can think of more unlikely regime changes, but not many. #p#Man for man, nevertheless, it doesn't really stack up. Not on paper, anyway. South Africa have been able to call on the more muscular, more urgent top five, the more lethal new-ball duo and the most productive allrounder in the history of international cricket; only in spin have England held a discernible edge, and few pitches have suited that particular suit. And while those 18 games have seen them edge the 50-plus scores (35 to 32), four of the six highest run-aggregators are South Africa's. The wickets column clarifies the picture to a degree - Broad (42), Anderson (36) and Graeme Swann (28) have all struck more often than the opposition's best (Morkel, 27) - but even then, England have only collected 184 to South Africa's 160: an advantage of 1.33 per game. Not what a mathematician would call a terribly significant stat, and certainly not one capable of explaining England's supremacy. At 117 to 103, the catch count is barely more illuminating. #p#Timing, as ever, is everything, and England have been demonstrably superior in the pivotal moments. Think Graham Onions staving off seemingly certain defeat in Centurion and Newlands; Broad, Swann and Mike Yardy whisking out the first five for 53 in the World Twenty20 in Barbados; Anderson confining De Villiers and Albie Morkel to singles in the final over of last year's one-run sneak in Johannesburg; Broad flinging down the gauntlet to Smith during the 2009 Champions Trophy and inducing a top edge; Swann choking de Villiers and Anderson unearthing those gems for de Villiers and JP Duminy on Sunday, and Broad docking the tail with such ruthless efficiency. All these games might easily have been lost; none was. In all five of the teams' closest limited-overs debates, no less revealingly, South Africa have stumbled chasing. And that Chennai choke, having been <m3>124 for 3</m3> and <m4>160 for 7</m4> pursuing 172, should be comfortably the most numbing. All of which suggests that while they are ahead in the paper game, they are losing the mind one by some considerable distance. #p#But why? This comparatively barren sequence began immediately after Smith had personally ended another, a wonderful unbeaten 154 at Edgbaston having secured his country's first Test series victory in England in more than four decades. Was the joy and relief so immense that he convinced himself the opposition were unworthy and failed to re-instill the requisite steel? Possibly, but surely that sense of superiority has now expired. That the England order has tended to include a few blokes who could have been batting for the opposition may have been more telling, not least since, for the last dozen encounters, they've been led by a bloke born in Smith's own hometown.
21	507054	ICC World Cup 2011	Tenacious England ready to scale twin peak	Andrew Miller	March 19, 2011	England's fightback against West Indies was thrilling, but now, having hauled themselves into the knock-outs, can they sharpen their focus to match their resolve? AFP Enlarge Related Links Audio/Video: Andrew Strauss: Doing our bit to advertise 50-over format. Players/Officials: James Anderson | Ravi Bopara | James Tredwell | Chris Tremlett | Luke Wright Matches: England v South Africa at Chennai Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: England #p#Leading into their do-or-die encounter in Chennai, there was a school of thought that England simply did not want to be in the World Cup anymore. Subconsciously, there was perhaps an element of truth at play, as a long, hard and emotional winter chugged towards its first realistic end-point. The plane was on the tarmac, fully fuelled-up and ready to go, and if anyone in the squad truly believed they were ready to duck the challenge, they could be back home in England right at this minute, like the blissfully indifferent Kevin Pietersen, freed from international duty for the first time since October. #p#If that seems a ridiculous notion in such a high-stakes tournament, then consider the logic - or lack thereof - that has governed England's campaign in recent days. When the team was on its knees, crying out for one last dose of heroism to spare them from the humiliation of a first-round exit, the management decreed that enough was already enough. Nothing more could be expected of such obvious go-to men such as James Anderson, whose mastery of swing and seam had delivered the Ashes on a plate in the first half of the winter, or Paul Collingwood, whose tank finally ran dry around the time of the Perth Test in December, and whose career has been gliding to a standstill on the hard shoulder ever since. #p#Instead England put their faith in fresh legs and clear minds, and turned the stage over to the likes of James Tredwell, Luke Wright, Chris Tremlett and Ravi Bopara - two of whom had not originally been selected in the World Cup squad, and two who had, but must have doubted if they'd ever be trusted to feature. And now, with Ajmal Shahzad's hamstring strain demanding a fourth change of personnel in the 15-man party, Andy Flower has followed a similar policy in opting for the inexperience of Jade Dernbach over older, wiser and, dare one say it, more cynical heads. If England string together three victories in their next three matches, they will have won the World Cup. Unless they get as excited about the coming days as Dernbach is sure to be, there will have been little point in pulling out all those stops in Chennai on Thursday night. #p#The gamble that they took against West Indies had the makings of a quiz question in years to come - ("who were the bowlers when England bombed out...") - but it was one that paid off handsomely in the crunch moments of the contest. Tremlett admittedly proved too hittable on a sit-up-and-beg surface, but his stooping catch at mid-off to dismiss Kemar Roach epitomised the difference in England's mindset when the game was on the line. Anderson in Ashes form would have gobbled that opportunity, no question, but what about the man who stopped and stared at Pietersen in Nagpur back in February, when Ryan ten Doeschate unleashed the skier that first exposed the frailties in a previously faultless fielding unit? #p#When the contest had been on a similar knife-edge against Bangladesh in Chittagong, the question had been put to the hollow-eyed Anderson: "How much do you really want this?" and the answer that echoed back was "not enough", as he served up a glut of leg-side wides to tear chunks out of the tail-end requirement. When Tredwell and the admirably combative Swann turned the West Indies match on its head, however, the euphoria at the fall of the final wicket answered all lingering doubts about England's hunger. They've done what they had to do to get out of a group that had been designed to guard against upsets, and having spent the past 48 hours sitting in Delhi wondering which flight they'd be boarding next, a trip to Colombo now looks the likeliest scenario. #p#It would be wrong to pin the blame for England's failings on fatigue and nothing else, not least because many other teams have had itineraries of similar ferocity. The Aussies, as England well know, haven't exactly had an easy time of it this winter, while India and South Africa spent the festive season hammering several bells out of one other in a memorable Test and ODI campaign, and none of those teams have made anything like as much of a meal of their qualification bids. #p#But in fairness to England, no-one else has had to process quite such a range of emotions to reach this point in time. For the first time in a long time, it's not ineptitude that has exposed their shortcomings, but disorientation. In short, England aren't used to being contenders - in any form of the game, let alone all three at once - and they are still working out what it takes to keep their standards topped up. #p#When the legendary Australian side of the 2000s was faced with the regular challenge of the Ashes and the World Cup in the same winter, they overcame the problem by winning absolutely everything in sight - except, lest it be forgotten, the CB Series in 2006-07, when England punctuated a winter of whitewashes and pedalos with the most third-rate bauble on offer. It was and remains an inexplicable heist from a team in free-fall whose captain had turned to the bottle, but it provided proof, however fleeting, that even the all-time greats end up lowering their standards once in a while - let alone teams such as this current England side who have yet to master the basics of consistency. #p#England got everything spot-on in the Ashes, but then, in their attempt to traverse between the two biggest peaks in their game, they lost their footing on the downward slope and went tumbling. The standards they set for themselves in that series, both on the field and in their David Saker-honed bowling strategies, were nowhere to be seen during a slack-witted one-day campaign in Australia, and they could not be rescued in time for the start of the World Cup. In hindsight, it is understandable how a team that had been performing at fever pitch for three months found it hard to replicate the same intensity against the likes of Netherlands, Ireland and Bangladesh, even if the full extent of their struggles still beggar belief. #p#England have been in this position before, itinerary-wise, and they do not intend going through it all again. By 2015, the Ashes and the World Cup will have been split into separate winters, and for the first time since 1992 - when, coincidentally, Graham Gooch's men performed as well as any side can without claiming the spoils - the game's most prestigious one-day trophy will not be contested on the back of a bone-jarring five-Test series against a Southern Hemisphere giant. #p#Three jet-lagged days at home and a ridiculous photo-call against the backdrop of Heathrow's perimeter fence was all the chance that Andrew Strauss and his team were given to process the magnitude of their triumph in Australia. But give it two more weeks, and they could have the chance for the homecoming to end all homecomings. After the tenacity they've shown just to stay alive, who would dare to discount them?

What a difference a week makes. After their stunning win over England, Ireland will believe they have the ability to take on anyone, and while India will undoubtedly be respected they will not be feared. #p#Ireland are coming up against one of the most formidable batting line-ups in world cricket on a featherbed at the Chinnaswamy stadium, however, and as they prepare to do battle with a top six that packs a whopping 44,503 ODI runs between them (although 17,777 belong to one man) perhaps a little fear wouldn't go amiss. There are significant dangers lurking in India's bowling line-up too. Ireland's XI is likely to have no less than five left-handers in it, and despite the docile playing surface, the challenge of countering multiple offspinners - and possibly Piyush Chawla's googly too - will be a daunting task. #p#Ireland will insist they're up for it, and after Wednesday night's events, who could argue with them? But if Ireland appear a team transformed, that is only in the eyes of those not close to the setup. Several players, including captain William Porterfield and allrounder John Mooney, have insisted that the result achieved against England is the sort the team go into all their games believing they can pull off. #p#That may be true, but whether they can convert belief into performance against the World Cup favourites, in the hothouse atmosphere sure to be provided by India's fanatical supporters, remains to be seen. India's fans were always going to pack the stands to watch their heroes, and tickets for this match sold out some time ago, but there is a lustre and sense of anticipation - not to mention the whispers of an upset - now that there might not have been before Kevin O'Brien's giant-killing epic. #p#There was similar talk before India's World Cup opener against Bangladesh, but the imperious ease of their eventual win made that sound like a misguided fantasy. While India's opinion of Ireland may well have changed in the last week, they will expect nothing less on Sunday. #p#Form guide (completed matches, most recent first) Ireland: WLWLL India: TWLLW #p#Watch out for... #p#It's almost superfluous to point out that all eyes will be on Kevin O'Brien when he comes out to bat on Sunday, but it could hardly be any other way after his record-breaking hundred. The burly allrounder was brutally dismissive of both pace and spin against England and there's no reason to think he'll play any differently against India - although this time he won't have the crowd's support when he does so. #p#It's no secret that international sides have attempted to counter Yusuf Pathan's destructive big-hitting by targeting him with short-pitched fast bowling. Ireland lack the firepower to adopt the same approach and Boyd Rankin, the 6' 6" seamer, is the only bowler who'll come close to troubling him. If Yusuf gets going India could post a total out of the reach of even O'Brien's expansive reach. #p#Team news MS Dhoni didn't give anything away when asked about a likely playing XI on the eve of the game, but appeared to confirm the rumour that Ashish Nehra was match-fit once more. India will play to their strength, which is batting, and that's likely to leave four spots up for grabs for the bowlers. The same group that played against England - Zaheer Khan, Munaf Patel, Harbhajan Singh and Piyush Chawla - is the logical conclusion. #p#India (probable): 1 Virender Sehwag, 2 Sachin Tendulkar, 3 Gautam Gambhir, 4 Virat Kohli, 5 Yuvraj Singh, 6 MS Dhoni (wk/capt), 7 Yusuf Pathan, 8 Harbhajan Singh, 9 Zaheer Khan, 10 Piyush Chawla, 11 Munaf Patel #p#Ireland were forced to make some last-minute changes to their line-up against England, with allrounder Andre Botha's unavailability meaning wicketkeeper-batsman Gary Wilson slotted in at No. 5. Botha is one of Ireland's most accomplished bowlers in the end overs - his accuracy and canny changes of pace brought him three cheap wickets against Bangladesh - and if he is match-fit, he'll play. Otherwise, Ireland have little reason to change the team that beat England. #p#Ireland (probable): 1 William Porterfield (capt), 2 Paul Stirling, 3 Ed Joyce, 4 Niall O'Brien (wk), 5 Kevin O'Brien, 6 Alex Cusack, 7 Andre Botha/Gary Wilson, 8 John Mooney, 9 Trent Johnston, 10 George Dockrell, 11 Boyd Rankin #p#Pitch and conditions #p#The pitch used will be the same one that produced 676 runs in India's game against England. It wore a green and grassy look on Saturday, though that may well change after it's been shaved and rolled, and though a dryer surface might give a little more help to the spinners (and help scuff up the ball and aid reverse swing later on), it's unlikely to be greatly dissimilar to the pitches seen here in recent times. Expect another high-scoring game on what should be a bright, sunny afternoon and a warm, clear evening. #p#Stats and trivia #p#The County cricketers in Ireland's team will no doubt have helped them puncture England's aura, but their experience against India is limited to a one-off match in Belfast in June 2007 that resulted in a nine-wicket win for India. There've been extensive changes to both line-ups since, but they will at least have some experience of facing the likes of Sreesanth and Piyush Chawla, although they will not have many happy memories of that experience as Chawla picked up 3 for 29, dismissing Kevin O'Brien for just 3, to rip the stuffing out of Ireland's middle order. #p#Gary Wilson, who played in the match against England, made his ODI debut in the 2007 game against India. #p#Kevin O'Brien became Ireland's leading run-scorer in ODIs in the course of his century against England, and now has 1,486 runs at 36.24. He's also hit 40 sixes in ODIs, almost double the number of anyone else in Ireland's squad. #p#Before this tournament started, the warm-up matches in Bangalore suggested conditions might favour spinners, but the ground has since produced 1,332 runs in just two games. The average score in the last three full internationals played here is 328. #p#The two men opening the batting for India, Virender Sehwag and Sachin Tendulkar, have scored more runs at the Chinnaswamy Stadium than anyone else. Tendulkar leads the way with 496 runs at 49.60, while Sehwag has 323 at 64.60 - although he's never scored an ODI hundred here. Zaheer Khan leads the way with wickets, having taken 11 at 30.18. #p#Quotes #p#"We have done the servicing and overhauling of all the cars for the race, and if at night there's no electrical failure then everyone will be available, so we'll pick the best XI cars." MS Dhoni cannot hide his enthusiasm for motor-vehicles while discussing the team selection #p#"If you can't go out there and get up for a game in front of 40-50,000 people then I think there's something wrong with you. Whether they are for you or against you, it doesn't matter. Obviously we will be looking to silence them as well." William Porterfield , the Ireland captain, is not worried about the pressures of a partisan crowd cheering against his team
22	504393	India v Ireland, Group B, World Cup 2011, Bangalore	We have to start again - Porterfield	Sharda Ugra in Bangalore	March 5, 2011	#p#Like everyone in the world of work, William Porterfield is heading into a weekend and wants to forget about what the middle of the week was like. Unlike for everyone else, Sunday will not be a day of rest for him, and he thinks putting the past behind is mandatory. "First of all, we have to put Wednesday behind us," the Ireland captain said, just over 24 hours from the time he will walk out with India captain MS Dhoni for the toss of the World Cup game at the Chinnaswamy Stadium. #p#Porterfield's Wednesday was made up of the match that has put Ireland's cricketers on the front pages of their newspapers back home and top of the mind of the cricketing public, particularly in the heated heart of the tournament's biggest hosts. A match that should have been a regulation two points for one team has suddenly turned into a contest between a high-profile, high-coverage outfit regarded as among the biggest favourites to lift the World Cup and a squad who, from the tournament's warm-up games up to Wednesday, have never left the field without a scrap. Victory over their historic and cultural rivals England on Wednesday has suddenly made Ireland genuine contenders for a quarter-final spot but Porterfield wants to brush all that under his team's suddenly-airborne carpet. #p#"We put in a good performance on Wednesday and created a wee bit of history there. Now we've got to start all over again," Porterfield said. His voice carries the vocabulary and echo of Ireland's strong, north-western 'Derry' accent that makes listeners from other parts of the cricket world lean forward, mouths open, in an attempt to both concentrate and comprehend. There is possibly no other cricket captain in the world who speaks in Porterfield's quick bursts of rapid speech or can use the word 'wee' on the way to sounding tough and purposeful. #p#He said, "We have a bigger challenge ahead of us, we're playing India, we must take good things from the [Wednesday] game and the biggest things for ourselves is to go out fresh on the pitch and concentrate on what's at hand." #p#Ireland's captain William Porterfield said he uses his bowlers depending on who is performing on the day AFP Enlarge #p#The team, he said, wouldn't be daunted by going out before a 39,000-strong crowd in Bangalore because their opening World Cup game in Dhaka had given them useful practice. "When we started the competition we knew we were playing two of the home nations in the group stage and they were going to be massive games." Indian support in Bangalore he thought would be similar to the "pretty fanatical supporters" Ireland had encountered in Dhaka. "I don't think that India's going to be too different from that; there's going to be a few more in tomorrow [Sunday] night than what there were in Bangladesh." He paused for the briefest of seconds saying. "India in India is a pretty special occasion but it's a challenge we are looking forward to." #p#What Ireland have braced themselves for is the possibility of a large 300-plus chase and Porterfield said it was why his team had chosen a long batting line-up, something facilitated by their many bowling options. The return of Andre Botha, their best death-overs bowler who was out of the England game due to an nth hour groin injury, would help the balance of the team but his absence now is not seen as critical as it may have been before the England match. #p#"It didn't really affect us because we've got so many options with the ball. Whoever comes up with the goods on the day, we just go with that. It could be that someone doesn't bowl, but as long as the team is doing well players just have to deal with that." He mentioned Paul Stirling's ten overs versus England as an example of making the team's options work. "He too pace off the ball, and bowled very well for us and it has kind of gone without mentioning. He took 1 for 45 off his ten through the middle overs which was crucial in helping restrict England." #p#Stirling is Porterfield's opening partner, and was used as a bowler in the England match ahead of the team's regular batting allrounder Kevin O'Brien, who went on to have what Porterfield would no doubt call a "wee" hand to play in the victory. With a poker face, Porterfield went on, "I don't think Kevin was too upset with that [not bowling]. He would take 100 off 50 balls and not having to bowl any day." #p#Questioned several times about the pressure of the crowd, Porterfield was quick, bald and revealing in his summary of what he expected. "If you can't go out there and get up for a game in front of 40-50,000 people, then I think there's something wrong with you. Whether they are for you or against you, it doesn't matter." #p#Win or lose on Sunday, Porterfield would want his team to hijack the name that the US' University of Notre Dame gives all its sports teams. They call them the Fighting Irish.
22	504409	India v Ireland, Group B, World Cup 2011, Bangalore	India to pick bowling attack based on opposition	Liam Brickhill in Bangalore	March 5, 2011	#p#The last three days have given MS Dhoni plenty to think about. Kevin O'Brien's inspirational innings against England means a wary India will be taking no chances against the plucky Ireland side in Bangalore, while the reaction of irate Bangladesh fans after their team's humiliating loss to West Indies will surely have stirred memories for India's captain. #p#West Indies' team bus was struck by stones as they travelled back from their match against Bangladesh in Mirpur, while the Daily Star also reported that a few fans on motorbikes threw stones at Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan's Magura home, leaving a window-pane broken. Dhoni's own home in Ranchi had been targeted in a similar manner, amid a wave of effigy-burning, by angry Indian fans after India's loss to Bangladesh in the 2007 World Cup. #p#"I think yesterday they missed the Bangladesh bus, because that's what they were waiting for," he joked, before taking on a far more serious tone. "It's unfortunate, but in the subcontinent that's how the fans react. They should remember it's not the players living in that [Shakib's] home right now, it's the family members and they don't have anything to do with cricket. You have to control your emotions. #p#"[As fans] you have to back the players. You need backing when you're not doing well because when you're winning games and everybody's with you, the emotions, the expectation level, the appreciation, everything is there. But the real fans of cricket will be with you when you're not doing well, when you are a bit low, when the team is not doing well, those are the real fans of cricket. Others, they just follow the wins of the team; whenever they are winning they are big fans of cricket." #p#MS Dhoni says he was never going to take Ireland lightly as he has already experienced losing to an underdog AFP Enlarge #p#A successful Indian team has had no such worries in this tournament so far, giving their legions of supporters plenty to celebrate even though their match against England ended in a tie. But if there had been any chance, at the beginning of the World Cup, that their encounter with Ireland might have been seen as an opportunity to experiment and rest key players, such thoughts were vanquished by the events of Wednesday night. #p#"I've never said there's any weaker side in the World Cup, because if you have very fond memories of getting beaten by Bangladesh in 2007 then you won't commit that mistake," Dhoni said on the eve of the Ireland clash. #p#"For every team it depends on that particular day. There are individuals in every side who can play big innings, score at an amazing strike rate of 150 or 200, and that can really change the course of the game. So the preparation level remains the same and the intensity should be the same as when we play any other side." #p#Dhoni admitted to being impressed by Kevin O'Brien's "unbelievable" knock, and glad that he had been a spectator to it rather than being on the receiving end. "We really enjoyed O'Brien's innings. It was not against us, so as a spectator you can enjoy each and every hit. We enjoyed every bit of his batting and the Ireland innings. #p#"Right from the very start he went after the bowlers but it was really impressive to see him change gears at the end because that's what was needed at that point. As far as strategies [against him] are concerned, every day is different so accordingly you have to plan for how a batsman is playing. But he got run out, so we'll try to get him run out in this game also." #p#A full-strength XI is a virtual certainty against a buoyant Ireland side who will be backing themselves to secure another major scalp, and Dhoni suggested that India would stick to the batting-heaving line-up as that is where their main strength lies. #p#"You should always back your strength, that's the most important part. Tomorrow we don't want to feel 'Okay now we would have been better off with seven batsmen', and maybe you score 30-odd runs less and you find yourself in a place where there's not enough runs on the board. We'll be more inclined to play with seven batters, of course Yusuf [Pathan] and Yuvraj [Singh] can also bowl and be the fifth bowler for the side." #p#With four slots remaining for the bowlers, the question for India will be which combination of spin and seam to play: three seamers and one specialist spinner, or two of each? If two spinners are included, will it be R Ashwin or Piyush Chawla who partners Harbhajan Singh? #p#Dhoni did not let on what India's plans were, but did defend his bowlers for leaking 338 runs in the game against England, saying the Bangalore wicket was flat. "We played against England with a two-two combination. Some people may say it didn't really affect the opposition but what we are saying is the wicket is behaving in a better way under the lights. What we have seen is that it's not a seamer-friendly wicket and as the game progresses by evening it comes on very nicely to the bat - there's no extra pace for the fast bowlers." #p#Dhoni suggested India's bowling combination might change from game to game depending on the opposition. "If there's plenty of left-handers in the opposition side then you may be inclined to play one more offspinner. Both Yusuf and Harbhajan are offspinners and both of them have bowled well. If the opposition are not very good at picking the wrong one from the legspinner then you are inclined to play Piyush Chawla. #p#"Piyush just gives you that variation of the bowler who can take it away and also has the wrong one. And you already have Harbhajan and Yusuf to bowl offspin. Ashwin has done exceptionally well for us whenever he has played and he has bowled in the first 10 overs also, but you just pick the one that may be most suitable for that particular game."
22	504415	India v Ireland, Group B, World Cup 2011, Bangalore	Reversing the scales key in Bangalore clash	Sharda Ugra in Bangalore	March 5, 2011	Kevin O'Brien has infused Sunday's clash with greater significance Associated Press Enlarge Related Links News : Buoyant Ireland face up to Indian batting colossus Matches: India v Ireland at Bangalore Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: India | Ireland #p#Everything in Indian cricket works on scale. Being the biggest and most widely-supported when the last World Cup came to Asia, it has gone on to becoming the richest, the most powerful, the most influential, the most vociferous, the most strident. In the same period its team has become the most successful in the country's history (minus the minor matter of a second World Cup win) and inched its way up various ranking ladders. #p#In Bangalore on Sunday, India meet a country where cricket is not even among the nation's top four sports, with no footprint on terrestrial television, where resources are stretched thinner than butter on a supermodel's toast, travelling supporters' numbers can't fill the Chinnaswamy and Sunday's match will just their third ODI under lights. #p#Yet when the two meet on Sunday in Bangalore, in a match that has gone from being shark versus sardine to giants versus gate-crashers, India and Ireland need to reverse these scales. #p#India must execute small and Ireland must perform big. #p#Against England, India's performance in the field was without the energy required of a side defending 338. Or wanting to win the World Cup. No matter what was happening to its bowlers, singles leaked through like cheap plumbing, and twos were handed over as generously as millionaires do loose change. India's ground fielding is never athletic, but last Sunday, it was wasteful. Batting first, India produced more fours and sixes than England but far fewer singles and twos. Even if India put out of memory the incomplete single from Munaf Patel on the last ball of their innings, it is a chart that should make them cringe. They should aim to never see its like again. #p#Even before England began chasing, India set themselves on the back foot through the manner in which their end overs were paced with the rapid loss of wickets and a good number of leftover dot balls. In a game which ends in a dead heat, when one side has 134 dot balls in its innings and the other 116, what does that say about the squads? Is it a reflection of the quality of the batsmen, the efficiency of the bowlers or what one team could do in the field against another? Or is this an illustration of the parity? Before answering that question remember, arithmetic never lies. #p#When the question about India's low turnover was put to MS Dhoni this afternoon, he said the dot balls didn't matter if 338 had been scored. On Sunday, none of this nitpicking may matter because India meet a team that can be matched man for man, record for record and of course, numbers for numbers. Do the math, India's fans may holler. India may get the result they desire out of the Sunday game but to regain their aura, they will need do what Jack in the nursery rhyme was asked to do: be nimble and be quick. So when the real candlestick turns up, muscle memory is what will helps them jump over. #p#The Indians these days train and work in a happy bubble of camaraderie, their football-volleyball-Usain Bolt routine on Friday leading to much laughter among the squad. They are well-cosseted by a ten-strong support staff and the tournament format that is intended to shepherd them into the quarter-finals at the very least. With all this, there is no good reason for them to pay so very little attention to the details in their match against England. #p#On Sunday, India entertained, as they have always done. They got the crowd on its feet as they have done throughout their history. Yet, only when an entertaining India links arms with efficiency, buffers its style with substance, do they set themselves up for a clinical sequence of victories. #p#Ireland are one of India's lighter-weight opponents when compared to two of the three that are lined up for the hosts within the next week. It will be the biggest stage the Irish have ever been on and it is why they must produce a performance that is memorable in both size and scale. Trent Johnston had told ESPNcricinfo that the Irish "liked to mix it with the big boys, to go out there and take them down every now and then." Cricket has experienced Ireland's 'every now and then' and so now.the Irish, whose freshness has been infectious at the World Cup, must walk onto the field believing they are on equal terms. To prove that they are more than a romantic 'story' that pops up every few years, who've gone from being amateur darlings into professional contestants. #p#It is a harsh requirement for a team that must scrap every season for survival and relevance in the world game. But if Ireland want to fight their way onto the FTP and double the international matches they play every year, they must play the match of their lives in Bangalore. Even if they believe they have just done so three days ago. #p#The morning after England, Johnston said it would be "hard to top yesterday" For an instant, he looked towards the tomorrow and the idea of India made him smile. "But Jeez, if we beat India in Bangalore..." he trailed off, suddenly remembering the quixotic, up-ended words of his former coach Adrian "A D" Burrell and laughed, "then, you can tie the dogs loose." Those are crazy, antithetical, impossible words. But hey, in two games, Bangalore's World Cup has produced a tie and an upset. Who's to say that the contrarian is not the conventional here?

AFP Enlarge Related Links Analysis : India's situation man News : Ireland beaten, but with their honour intact. Players/Officials: Yuvraj Singh Matches: India v Ireland at Bangalore Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: India | Ireland #p#Yuvraj Singh saved the blushes for India, allowing them to hide the ordinary effort from other spinners, by <m6>picking his maiden five-for</m6> to <m7>restrict Ireland to 207</m7> before <m8>he hit an unbeaten fifty</m8> to settle India's nerves in <m9>a hard-fought win</m9> in Bangalore. Ireland enhanced their reputation by defending the target with disciplined bowling and excellent fielding and <m10>made India huff and puff to the victory line</m10>. #p#On a dry pitch, where the ball came on slowly, the Indian batsmen preferred to play within themselves and tried to play risk-free cricket but kept losing wickets at regular intervals to keep Ireland interested in the chase. <m11>India were 24 for 2 in the sixth over</m11>, <m12>reached 100 for four</m12> at <m13>the fall of Virat Kohli in the 24th over</m13>, and <m14>recovered to 167 for 5</m14> when <m15>MS Dhoni exited in the 41st over</m15> before <m16>Yusuf Pathan flexed his muscles</m16> to hasten <m17>the end</m17>. #p#Ireland could have done far better had they not stumbled against Yuvraj's bowling. They were eyeing a 250-plus target after <m18>a 113-run third-wicket stand between William Porterfield and Niall O'Brien</m18> but <m19>a run-out</m19> opened a window for Yuvraj to trigger a collapse. The most significant moment of the innings came in the 27th over, with <m20>Ireland sitting pretty on 122 for 2</m20>, <m21>when a set Niall O'Brien couldn't make it in time to beat the throw from Virat Kohli in the covers. Dhoni did well to collect the slightly wayward throw and flick it onto the stumps.</m21> It was the beginning of the end. #p#As ever, Yuvraj ambled in like a Sunday-park bowler and as always proved to be street-smart. His art is very simple: he turns the ball slightly but his USP is the variation in pace, using a scrambled seam. He is usually slow and slower but surprises the batsmen with a quicker one. Today, too, he struck to his regular staple diet of slower ones; some were delivered with a round arm, some from higher straighter arm, and some with a crouched bent-knee release to get the ball to skid on. #p#Smart Stats. India improved their record at the Chinnaswamy stadium to 12 wins from 18 matches. They have lost only four matches and tied one. They have not lost a single match in World Cups in Bangalore. <m22>Yuvraj Singh's 5 for 31</m22> is his career-best and the fifth five-wicket haul by an Indian bowler in World Cups. Ashish Nehra, Venkatesh Prasad, Kapil Dev and Robin Singh are the other Indian bowlers to pick up five wickets in a World Cup game. Yuvraj's spell is the eighth-best bowling performance by a spinner in ODIs. The best spell is Anil Kumble's 6 for 12 in 1993. <m23>The 113-run stand between William Porterfield and Niall O'Brien</m23> is the highest for the third wicket for Ireland in ODIs surpassing the 89 between Andre Botha and Niall O'Brien against Netherlands in 2008. <m24>When he scored a half-century, Yuvraj</m24> became the first player to score a fifty and pick up five wickets in a match in World Cup game. Viv Richards and Paul Collingwood remain the only players to score a century and pick up five or more wickets in an ODI. <m25>The 67-run stand between MS Dhoni and Yuvraj</m25> was their 20th fifty-plus partnership in ODIs. Their average of 48.90 is the third highest among all Indian batting pairs who have aggregated over 2000 runs. #p#If you just catch the highlights of his wickets, most would seem like soft dismissals. To an extent they were, but that's the illusion of nothingness he provides the batsmen, who then make seemingly silly mistakes. <m26>Andrew White was sucked into edging a flighted delivery to Dhoni</m26>, <m27>Kevin O'Brien tapped one softly back</m27>, <m28>Porterfield swatted a short ball straight to cover</m28> and <m29>John Mooney and Alex Cusack were trapped by skidders that came in with the arm.</m29> <m30>When White fell in the 30th over</m30>, <m31>Ireland were 129 for 4</m31> and <m32>by the time Yuvraj got Cusack</m32>, <m33>Ireland had slid to 184 for 8 in the 44th over</m33>. #p#Until then, India were looking really ragged in the field. Only <m34>Zaheer Khan bowled well to take two early wickets</m34> and <m35>Porterfield and Niall O'Brien played risk-free cricket</m35> to lay a good platform. Their case was helped by some ordinary bowling from the spinners. Harbhajan Singh looked off-key, straying on to the pads once too often, Yusuf Pathan erred on length, often dragging them short, and Piyush Chawla hit the wrong lines. #p#None of that profligacy was seen in Ireland's bowling effort. <m36>Trent Johnston, who is the top wicket taker for Ireland, struck two vital blows early, getting Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir to ensure India wouldn't waltz to an easy win.</m36> Almost immediately, Porterfield brought in the teenaged left-arm spinner <m37>George Dockrell, who turned in a pleasing opening spell that read 4-0-14-0.</m37> He rarely gave anything to cut, always bowled slow through the air and was never afraid to flight. He had Kohli mistiming a few shots and made Tendulkar bat cautiously. <m38>Success came in his second spell, when he struck in his first delivery of the 21st over, trapping Tendulkar with a delivery that went past the attempted sweep.</m38> <m39>He could have got the wicket of Kohli, too, in his next over but Niall O'Brien, the keeper, couldn't hold on to an edge.</m39> Later, <m40>he trapped Dhoni lbw with a delivery that straightened on middle and leg to give a window of hope for Ireland</m40> but <m41>Yusuf Pathan shut it very quickly with two monstrous sixes in the same over</m41>. #p#Match Timeline

Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: George Dockrell | Trent Johnston Matches: India v Ireland at Bangalore Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: India | Ireland #p#The minnow milestone. <m1>When Niall O'Brien opened his wrists into a precisely-placed drive that threaded the field and bounced over the rope in the ninth over, he achieved more than just the first boundary of his innings.</m1> He also became the third Irish player to score 1,000 runs in one-day internationals - joining his brother Kevin and his captain William Porterfield in an elite league. #p#The anti-climax. Such is the name he's made for himself after that innings, there was a loud rumble of approval from the crowd when Kevin O'Brien's name was announced as part of the Ireland XI before the start of play, and an even bigger cheer when walked to the crease after <m2>Andrew White's stumping</m2>. There was no repeat of last Wednesday's heroics, however, as <m3>he managed one muscular thump to the cover boundary</m3> but <m4>departed soon after, chipping the ball tamely back into Yuvraj Singh's waiting hands</m4> to spark the spectators' loudest shout of the innings. #p#The yips. Piyush Chawla was preferred to R Ashwin as the second specialist spinner in India's attack for this game, but had a disappointing day despite a surprisingly helpful surface, upon which the ball gripped and ripped. <m5>His nadir came in his fourth over - the 24th of the innings</m5> - when, facing a growing barracking from the crowd, <m6>he sent down three wides</m6> and <m7>a front-foot no-ball</m7> in <m8>a 10-ball over</m8> that also included <m9>a crunching cover drive for four to take Porterfield to his half-century</m9>. He recovered somewhat thereafter, but <m10>his final figures of 0 for 56 in eight overs</m10> remained distinctly sub-par in comparison to his team-mates. #p#The chicken dance. The world was first treated to Trent Johnston's 'chicken dance' celebration during the World Cup in the Caribbean four years ago, and though he's a little older and a lot more bald now he showed he still knew how to cut a rug in some style after <m11>his caught-and-bowled dismissal of Virender Sehwag</m11>. A packed, 40,000-strong crowd was stunned into silence - partly by the wicket, and partly by the bizarre gyrations that followed it - and Johnston provided a timely reminder of Ireland's passionately joyful brand of cricket. #p#The DRS moment. The use of the review system hasn't been entirely free of controversy in this tournament, and the so-called '2.5 metre rule' has borne the brunt of the criticism - and caused most of the confusion. The offending clause was tweaked ahead of this game, and <m12>Alex Cusack was the first to feel the effect of the change of protocol. Originally given not out, HawkEye suggested the ball would've hit middle - the crucial point - and so the decision was reversed and Cusack was sent on his way.</m12> <m13>The decision also gave Yuvraj Singh his first five-wicket haul</m13> in ODIs. #p#The DRS moment Part II. <m14>George Dockrell celebrated with understandable enthusiasm after trapping Sachin Tendulkar - a man who had scored more than 2,000 international runs, including three centuries, before he was even born - but he was made to wait a while before the wicket that the Dockrell grandchildren will hear about was finalised. Rather a long while, actually, as Tendulkar and his partner Virat Kohli engaged in a lengthy discussion over whether to ask for a review. That decision is meant to be made in "no more than a few seconds" according to the rulebook, but as the conversation continued the game came to a standstill. Tendulkar eventually trudged off, and Dockrell's place in cricketing lore was secured.</m14>
22	504570	World Cup 2011	ICC tweaks 2.5 metre DRS rule for 'consistency'	Sharda Ugra	March 6, 2011	What the law says. If a 'not out' decision is being reviewed, in order to report that the ball is hitting the stumps, the evidence provided by technology should show that the centre of the ball would have hit the stumps on any part of the middle stump ( previously "within an area demarcated by a line drawn below the lower edge of the bails and down the middle of the outer stumps" ). #p#The ICC has made a slight but significant alteration to the 2.5m rule, the most controversial segment of its decision review system (DRS) used in this World Cup, to enable more consistent application by the umpires. The change to the DRS rule No. 3.3 - which expands the umpire's scope for interpretation - follows its contrary usage in the first two weeks of the competition. #p#An ICC spokesperson confirmed to ESPNcricinfo that the umpires have "changed the protocol" in the clause to ensure a "consistency" of on-field umpires when using the DRS pertaining to not out lbw reviews. #p#A directive has gone out from the ICC's Umpires & Referees manager to all umpires that if an lbw appeal shows that even though there may be a distance between the stumps and the point of impact of 2.5m or greater, the on-field umpire can think of reversing the decision even if the replay shows that the ball is hitting "any part of the middle" stump. #p#The altered rule came into application <m1>during an lbw appeal against Alex Cusack</m1> in the India v Ireland game. Getty Images Enlarge #p#The previous rule required that the leg-before could be reversed - by the on-field umpire - only if the replay showed that the ball was hitting the middle stump dead centre. This change in the 'protocol' was brought into play in the India v Ireland match in Bangalore, <m2>when umpire Rod Tucker reversed his lbw decision against Alex Cusack off the bowling of Yuvraj Singh.</m2> Tucker was heard on the stump microphone asking third umpire Marais Erasmus to let him know whether the ball was hitting "any part of the middle stump." The third umpire, it was confirmed, was also required to give the on-field umpire "all relevant information" during an lbw review and not merely specific pieces of information during the DRS process. #p#Teams had also been informed of this alteration in the rule and Yuvraj said later that while he "did not understand the 2.5 rule much", he knew it had been what he called "removed." He said the current rule stated that if, "the ball is hitting the line, it's out... I was just discussing it with Dhoni, so I took the referral." #p#The application of the same 2.5m rule had led to two contrasting reviews under the DRS last week, one involving Ian Bell - in England's match against India - and the other the Zimbabwe captain Elton Chigumbura against New Zealand. Both batsmen were struck well forward from the stumps but the not out decision against Bell's was not overturned while Chigumbura was declared out. #p#The 2.5m clause was included in the DRS rules following the expert view that the predictive path of the ball-tracker technology (in this case Hawk Eye) lost its accuracy when the distance between the point of impact and the stumps was greater than 2.5m.
22	504577	India v Ireland, Group B, World Cup 2011, Bangalore	Ireland beaten, but with their honour intact	Liam Brickhill at the Chinnaswamy Stadium	March 6, 2011	#p#The citadel of the Chinnaswamy remains secure for India, but the men in green made those in blue fight hard for <m1>victory</m1> and will leave Bangalore with their honour intact. <m2>A gritty 113-run stand between captain William Porterfield and Niall O'Brien</m2>, Ireland's highest for the third wicket, leant a respectable sheen to the total and Ireland's never-say-die attitude was in full evidence in the field as they made India fight for every run before <m3>a blitzkrieg of Yusuf Pathan boundaries sealed the battle</m3>. #p#Outgunned on almost every front, Ireland nevertheless kept themselves in the game until <m4>the very end</m4>. <m5>Porterfield and the elder O'Brien defied the opposition</m5> and the baying crowd to haul their side out of <m6>a perilous 9 for 2</m6>, and <m7>Trent Johnston's two early wickets in his opening spell</m7> breathed life into the innings - especially after his scene-stealing 'chicken dance' celebration at <m8>Virender Sehwag's dismissal</m8>. Throughout, Ireland fought as a team and <m9>eventually lost as a team</m9>, and there was plenty for their captain to be proud of despite <m10>the defeat</m10>. #p#"I'm definitely [proud]," said Porterfield. "There were a lot of key moments through that game where it would've been easy to sit back and say 'well we're playing India and we're on the back foot'. <m11>We were 9 for 2</m11> and we fought back from that, and <m12>we lost three quick wickets in the middle</m12> and we fought back again. And we came out after halftime and fought right from the start and put a bit of pressure on India. We really fought, the way we fielded and bowled throughout, and it's a great credit to the lads." #p#A travelling brigade of Irish supporters was dwarfed by the 40,000-strong legion of Indian fans that packed the stands, but their team gave them ample reason to make themselves heard all the same. It helped that Ireland's relentless nipping at the ankles of the more fancied Indians meant the home fans couldn't have it all their own way, and for extended sessions there was a tangible mood of silent, even nervous apprehension in the stadium. #p#"The green stands out from the rest of the crowd," added Porterfield. "It's good to see so many people travelling over. It's great to see the support even back at the hotel, you walk about and you see a lot of familiar faces and a lot of Irish accents. That's great to see and all credit to them for come out here and spending the money to travel and taking time. The lads really appreciate it and hopefully they keep coming." #p#William Porterfield's team made India fight for <m13>their win</m13>. Getty Images Enlarge #p#Their neighbours across the Irish sea had the firepower to push India to the very brink last Sunday, but Ireland don't have quite the stocks that England do. Porterfield rued the "two key moments" where they slipped behind the pace and subsequently failed to set what could have been a challenging total - <m14>O'Brien's run-out that broke their century stand</m14>, and <m15>his own dismissal for 75 when he slapped a Yuvraj Singh long-hop straight to cover</m15>. "I think those were the two key points where we could have kicked on from the position we were in, but <m16>we lost two wickets</m16> and that set us back a bit," he said. #p#In the field, Ireland were also struck by <m17>Johnston's knee injury in his fifth over</m17> and his guile and experience was sorely missed later on. Scans revealed no fracture or ligament damage, and it is hoped he would be fit for Ireland's next game against West Indies in Mohali in five days time. The bowling attack stuck gamely to their plans in his absence, and there was a touch of a wobble in India's chase when <m18>Virat Kohli was run out</m18> to reduce them to <m19>100 for 4</m19>. #p#M S Dhoni has masterminded just this sort of chase countless times before, however, and he nudged his way into the 20s with little fanfare, biding his time and playing himself in and coming to terms with the vagaries of a pitch which offered far more succour to bowlers of all types than had been the case in the previous two games here. #p#With less than 50 needed, Porterfield's last throw of the dice was to hand the ball to his two most dangerous bowlers: Boyd Rankin and George Dockrell. As the stadium's sound system blared out a techno-infused Bon Jovi singing "it's my life, and it's now or never" <m20>Dockrell skipped to the crease and delivered a perfectly-flighted delivery that nipped past Dhoni's lunging defensive stroke and would've smashed into middle had his back leg not got in the way.</m20> <m21>India were 167 for 5</m21> and it seemed there would be a final twist to the chase. #p#<m22>Enter Yusuf.</m22> <m23>He responded to the situation in explosive fashion, re-awakening the stadium with a volley of enormous hits.</m23> <m24>He blasted 16 off the last five balls Dockrell bowled</m24>, <m25>hammered a third six straight down the ground off Paul Stirling</m25>, and <m26>finished the job with a flashing glance to the fine-leg boundary shortly afterwards</m26>. <m27>The end came quickly for Ireland</m27>, but the lasting impression they gave was of a team that truly believes it can win every game it plays, no matter who the opposition is. #p#"We fought really hard when we came out again and threw ourselves around in the field, and also the way we bowled, especially defending a small total like that. As long as we kept picking up wickets it was always there. You never know, we could've come in and got Yusuf first ball and then that would've put even more pressure on them again. You never know what could've happened from there, but we fought hard in defending 200 and you can't ask for any more."

Part-time performer with the ball, who produced more than a side show, and a batsman who left his dazzle in the dressing room because India required something slightly more sober. #p#<m1>India's five-wicket victory over Ireland</m1> in Bangalore on Sunday night was hard-earned. If the total of 207 was far less than what Ireland wanted, it was because Yuvraj's unbroken middle-overs spell broke open Ireland's innings at the point when it could have raised its pace. When India chased, runs had to be eked out as if they were water from stone - and it was Yuvraj who kept his head down and his instincts under control, <m2>after the top three were gone</m2> and <m3>an awful run-out</m3> had reduced <m4>India to 100 for 4</m4>. #p#In an odd statistical quirk, he happened to become the first man in the World Cup's 36-year history replete with star allrounders to <m5>take five wickets</m5> and <m6>score a 50</m6> in a match. Everyone knows about his batting talent, but five wickets would make any bowler happy, whether he chucks pies or not. He said <m7>the five-for</m7> had brought him the same glow from his first ODI century against Bangladesh. #p#That flighted ball: A deceptive lollipop. Associated Press Enlarge #p#Yuvraj's bowling is the alter ego of his more public identity, the one the bowling alley folks were waiting for. Menacing backlift meets monstrous bat speed, turning ball becomes into fast-moving object. Yuvraj the bowler trots in like some quieter, unthreatening, apologetic identical twin just looking to get a few things out of the way. A run-up of six or so steps lasts a few seconds, the left arm whirls over like thousands must do on thousands of unremarkable streets and in signature flourish, the left leg pops out in biomechanically unbecoming afterthought. Michael Holding, breathe easy. Never mind poetry in motion, this is not even a nursery rhyme on the move. To a batsman he looks like one of those odds & ends men pulled out by teams to hurry through their overs because the boys really don't want to pay any more Match Referee fines. #p#Against Ireland, he looped the ball into the air, setting them up like lollipops to be grabbed and gobbled. Ireland's batsmen, trying to get in on a pitch quite unlike the belter against England, only saw the sweeties, not the set-up. Yuvraj said later that the pitch had played slower than even a week ago and against Ireland, he had tried to keep the ball hanging in the air as long as possible. His fractional turn may have induced error after error, in the attempt to both get comfortable - Andrew White and Kevin O'Brien - and then, to get moving. <m8>Like captain William Porterfield did after the second drinks break, at a time when Ireland needed glue and not a soft dismissal from their top-scorer.</m8> <m9>The Alex Cusack dismissal will be the one most remembered, not so much for Yuvraj's sleight of hand, but for being India's most smartly calculated DRS appeal so far.</m9> #p#Just as Yuvraj the bowler had surprised Ireland, Yuvraj the batsman showed all of India his more thoughtful side. He has had a wretched 2010, which left him a messy heap, high on the injury scale and low on form. It is his bowling performances that made up all his good news. Yet, after the game today he said he did not think that his lesser skill had been the source of an increased confidence. "I won't say bowling has made me regain my confidence... whether I take wickets or I don't take wickets, I want to go and score runs. It's important for me that I finished the game for India. It gives me a lot of confidence going into the next match. I'm just happy about how I am hitting the ball." #p#He has hit it well in Bangalore, his innings of 58 (off 50 balls, including nine fours) against England was the polar opposite of <m10>the half-century against Ireland, (50 off 75 balls, including three fours)</m10>. <m11>His best shot, one of only three boundaries, came at the tail end of the Indian innings off a John Mooney full toss.</m11> <m12>An innings of humility and graft ended with a shot that sounded of regal contempt.</m12> It was a reminder of who Yuvraj can still be. #p#In his fairly cheery post-match media conference he said this last week had brought pleasant reminders. "I am just happy <m13>to win the game</m13> for India. I remembered that when I had been in the best of my form, I have done that for India in the middle stages of an innings." His role in the India's batting line-up, "to play till the end" whether batting first or chasing, may be the reason he has been able to take his mind off the more distracting side of his game: what it looks like on the outside rather than what it means on the inside. He said, "I might not be scoring at a strike-rate of 100, but it's important for me to finish the game. Hopefully the moment I get my 100 percent strike-rate, I'm sure I'll take my batting to the next level." #p#Right now, in this World Cup, India will hope they are the collective Yuvraj Singh. One side of their game working smoothly, another scratching around in and around fluency, and living on the belief that one day, when it really matters, everything will come together. Then, it will all look like magic, inspired, pulled out some rabbit's hat, but it will have taken a long and arduous trek to get there.
23	504531	Canada v Kenya, Group A, World Cup 2011, Delhi	Kamande promises improved Kenyan performance	Nagraj Gollapudi in Delhi	March 6, 2011	Jimmy Kamande feels it is tough to motivate his side after three woeful performances AFP Enlarge Related Links Preview : Clash of the lesser equals Players/Officials: Jimmy Kamande Matches: Canada v Kenya at Delhi Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Kenya #p#"Lean forward. Keep your head still. Don't hit hard... look for the timing. Go through the full shot, don't stop halfway." These were the exhortations of Eldine Baptiste, the Kenya coach, as he paced up and down the various nets on Sunday morning. It is not that the Kenyan batsmen do not know the basics. The problem is that they are not applying them leading to disastrous defeats in their previous three matches, where their highest score has been 142 while their bowlers have been wayward. #p#The rights and wrongs of the Associates being shunted out from the next World Cup has been widely debated, but what about the insufficient improvement countries like Kenya have made despite getting a big helping hand from the ICC. In fact, Jimmy Kamande, Kenya's captain, acknowledges the support Richard Done, the ICC's High Performance manager, has given to uplift the status of the game in the country known more for its marathon runners than cricketers. #p#As far as exposure goes Kenya have played one-day series against Zimbabwe twice in the last two years, played couple of domestic sides from India both at home and away, visited South Africa to play second-string domestic sides in addition to contesting in various Associates tournaments. So they are not exactly starting from scratch. Kenya remain the only Associate to make the knockouts stage in World Cup history, reaching the semi-finals in 2003. It was the most opportune moment to take a big stride forward, but Kenya have been back sliding since then. #p#Tomorrow they can learn from Canada, who nearly pulled the rug under Pakistan's feet earlier in the week. Though Canada's batsmen stuttered while chasing a low score, they showed a lot of character in the 46-run defeat. One of the big positives was their bowlers who just focussed on bowling a tighter line while Pakistan's batsmen plunged into mistakes with surprising conviction. #p#"It is a bit of an opportunity to perform against them from every corner to earn ourselves a bit of respect," Kamande said. "It has been tough for us in the past three games. We have not done justice to our abilities. Hopefully we'll put up a good score." Surely it is not an easy job to lead a side that is losing so badly. "It is a lot of work when you are losing in every series, not just the World Cup, to keep the guys strong, to keep working hard, to keep motivating them. We have to keep every player believe in himself so that he can believe he can do wonders." #p#Kamande could definitely do with some help especially from two men who have been their beacon of hope for long. Steve Tikolo and Thomas Odoyo, the grand old men of Kenyan cricket, have a lot to answer for and time is running out on them. They have to dispel the news that they are part of a clique that is against Baptiste's way of doing things. Odoyo missed out on playing Sri Lanka and had nothing much to say in the opening match against New Zealand where Kenya were knocked out for a record low of 67. Against Pakistan he was the highest wicket-taker with 3-41 and would need to produce better figures against Canada. But it is Tikolo who remains a mystery. Once a prodigious talent, Tikolo never managed to scale the heights expected of him and remains a failure so far this tournament, scoring a total of 22 runs. "They are the leaders. Steve is the guy with his experience in the batting," Kamande said. "Thomas is the new ball bowler and they play a big role for us." #p#The day before New Zealand dealt them the knockout punch in Chennai, Kamande had said that his team would like to bring to the table the Kenyan brand of cricket. And what is that brand? "Enjoying the game, hitting the ball and not playing defensive. The idea is to be positive," Kamande said. That has not happened yet. "We have not given ourselves a chance to express ourselves. I guarantee you tomorrow we are going to express much more than we did in the past matches," Kamande said, with an expression of a man who has been challenged.
23	504564	Canada v Kenya, Group A, World Cup 2011, Delhi	'Batsmen need to step up' - Bagai	Nagraj Gollapudi in Delhi	March 6, 2011	Balaj Rao's bowling has been a bright spot for Canada Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Preview : Clash of the lesser equals Players/Officials: Ashish Bagai | Balaji Rao Matches: Canada v Kenya at Delhi Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Canada #p#Ashish Bagai is a brave man. Last week, ahead of the game against Zimbabwe, the Canada captain said it was an important match, one which his team were confident of winning. It was thrashed by 175 runs. Today, he replaced Zimbabwe with Kenya, and both the struggling teams backed themselves to open their account in the tournament. This only adds some weight to the contest, the battle of the minnows. #p#Earlier in the day, Jimmy Kamande, Bagai's counterpart, said that his team would play the Kenyan brand of cricket - bold and expressive. Bagai was equal to the challenge: "Good competitive cricket, a good brand of cricket will give us success," he said. #p#Canada's biggest stumbling block has been the failure of the batsmen. Even John Davison, their most senior batsman , whom the rest of the team looks for direction, has been indecisive. He missed out on playing Pakistan in a thrilling contest where Canada held the upper-hand at the innings break, chasing 185. An impressive amount of grit kept them alive till the half-way stage. But the batsmen failed to accelerate to keep up with the asking rate, eventually panicked and lost the match. Davision was left to wonder if his participation would have made a difference, but with a tally of two runs in two matches he'd know his batting needs a lot of work. #p#But he is not alone; the rest of the batsmen including Bagai have to own up to their responsibility. In all the three matches, the top order has failed to even raise 50 runs; 47 remains the highest score so far by a batsman; Canada has not been able to reach 150. "If we get our batting right we should be competitive. It has been a worry right from the warm-ups. Bowling has hitting the straps in the last few games but it is the batsmen still have to step up," Bagai said. #p#Nearly 50% of the wickets (13 out of 31) have been taken by spinners at the Ferozshah Kotla in the two matches played so far. That prompted Bagai to give an indication of Canada's gameplan on Monday. "Looking at the last two games it is the spinners who have dominated on this wicket. Balaji Rao is going to be the key for us. We probably might play another spinner with Parth Desai slotted to open." #p#Rao, who played for Railways and Tamil Nadu on the Indian domestic circuit, before emigrating to Canada for studies in 2003, agreed with his captain on spin being a catalyst on the Kotla track. But he added a wicket-to-wicket line would be mandatory for a spinner. "The Delhi wicket initially keeps low and holds the line. It just starts turning midway into the second innings," Rao, who has six wicket so far, said. #p#Rao is now part of the team think-tank along with Bagai and Dyson and integral to the team's success. In the previous match against Pakistan, he raised eyebrows and stirred emotions among the Indian fans by engaging in a verbal duel with the Pakistan pair of Umar Gul and Ahmed Shehzad. Rao had already posed difficult questions to the Pakistan batsmen earlier the afternoon by removing Misbah-ul-Haq and Umar Akmal when the pair was leading the recovery in the middle overs. #p#When Gul and Shehzad "abused" him, Rao, who now works in the insurance industry, took the risk of rising to their bait. "I just basically believe that if somebody gives you something you have to give it back to him. I had a few swipes against Umar Gul and he had a few things to say, so I said ja, jakar bowling kar (Just go and bowl). But from point, Ahmed Shehzad abused me which was uncalled for. Then I got hit on the shoulder, and again Gul had something to say and I shooed him away," Rao recollected. #p#The incident has not distracted him much, as Rao had another good memory from the Pakistan match, one that he will take into Kenya game. Asked of his favourite dismissal, Rao said: "Akmal was the wicket I enjoyed because I was able to turn the ball square earlier. The one that got him was a flipper that went through. With the second new ball, it helped as the odd ball turns and the batsman is left guessing. So I had the midwicket back and I was pushing him back so that he could take a single. That ball held the line and hit him in line of the stump."
23	504565	Canada v Kenya, Group A, World Cup 2011, Delhi	Clash of the lesser equals	The Preview by Abhishek Purohit	March 6, 2011	#p#Match Facts March 7, Delhi Start time 14:30 local time (09:00 GMT) #p#Ashish Bagai feels that Balaji Rao, the legspinner, will be crucial for Canada on the Kotla pitch AFP Enlarge Related Links News : 'Batsmen need to step up' - Bagai News : Kamande promises improved Kenyan performance Matches: Canada v Kenya at Delhi Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Canada | Kenya #p#Big Picture #p#Canada and Kenya usually don't go in to a World Cup game expecting to win, and certainly aren't expected to do so by others. Tomorrow's encounter provides an exception. Despite having misfired in several areas in their previous three games, both sides know they are expected to win this time. Having given Pakistan a scare in Colombo, Canada would feel they are slightly ahead going in to this one, but their bowlers were helped by the cloud cover that hung over the Premadasa. Chances of getting that kind of assistance in Delhi are slim. #p#There is not much that separates the sides. In fact, they have a lot in common. Both have conceded 300-plus totals, and while that may be in keeping with the trend this tournament, they haven't managed to bat themselves past 150 in a single game. Kenya looked to be on their way to do that against Sri Lanka, but were blown away by Lasith Malinga's yorkers. #p#Kenya would like to think they have the better pedigree, but Canada have displayed more spirit and gumption so far. Jimmy Kamande, Kenya's captain, has instead had to deny reports of a rift between the coach Eldine Baptiste and some players. He has admitted it is difficult to keep motivating a side that has consistently under-performed. #p#Given how little there is to choose between the two, the odds are that there might not be a familiar batting collapse at the least. #p#Form guide (Most recent completed games first) #p#Canada LLLLW #p#Kenya LLLWL #p#Pitch and conditions #p#If it's the Kotla, turn and low bounce cannot be that far. The spinners will like the surface. Imran Tahir and Pieter Seelaar certainly did, when South Africa and Netherlands played here. The weather is expected to be moderately warm by Delhi's hot standards. #p#Watch out for  #p#Collins Obuya laboured to a half-century against Sri Lanka. That was what his team needed after a couple of early wickets had fallen. He should find it easier against Canada. He has been Kenya's most prolific batsman of late, and possesses a game that can be altered depending on the situation. #p#Balaji Rao enjoyed his battle against Pakistan's heavyweight middle order, and snapped up Misbah-ul-Haq and Umar Akmal. The legspinner was unafraid to flight the ball, and though he went for some runs, he tested a line-up that plays spin very well. Kenya don't, and Balaji will be itching to have a go. #p#Team news #p#Ashish Bagai has said that Parth Desai, the 20-year old left-arm spinner, could play tomorrow. That means one of the seamers could sit out. John Davison, the veteran opener, could also be back after a niggle made him miss the Pakistan game. #p#Canada: (probable) 1 John Davison, 2 Nitish Kumar/Ruvindu Gunasekera, 3 Ashish Bagai (wk/capt), 4 Zubin Surkari, 5 Rizwan Cheema, 6 Jimmy Hansra, 7 Tyson Gordon, 8 Khurram Chohan, 9 Harvir Baidwan, 10 Balaji Rao, 11 Parth Desai. #p#Kenya have no major injury concerns, and Thomas Odoyo should come back after missing the match against Sri Lanka. #p#Kenya : (probable) 1 Maurice Ouma (wk), 2 Seren Waters, 3 Collins Obuya, 4 Steve Tikolo, 5 David Obuya, 6 Tanmay Mishra/Rakep Patel, 7 Thomas Odoyo, 8 Jimmy Kamande (capt), 9 Nehemiah Odhiambo, 10 Shem Ngoche, 11 Elijah Otieno. #p#Try picking the XIs for tomorrow's game by playing Team Selector. #p#Stats and trivia #p#The Canada squad has scored a total of 4359 ODI runs. Steve Tikolo alone has made 3399. #p#The sides have played against each other in 12 ODIs, Kenya winning seven of them, including their two encounters at the 2003 and 2007 World Cups. #p#Quotes #p#"This is our best chance of a win in the World Cup. If we get our batting right we should be competitive." Ashish Bagai knows an opportunity when he sees one. #p#"I guarantee you tomorrow we are going to express much more than we did in the past matches." Jimmy Kamande believes Kenya can still show what they are made of.

Kenya, though, just about achieved their captain Jimmy Kamande's goal of playing out 50 overs; <m13>gutsy half-centuries from Tanmay Mishra and Thomas Odoyo</m13> acting as the bedrock of what was their best batting performance of the tournament. #p#<m14>Osinde was getting the ball to swerve a touch at the start, and that provided him with a wicket off the second delivery of the match, when Maurice Ouma was drawn towards the ball and edged it to slip as he belatedly tried to leave.</m14> <m15>Seren Waters, the promising opener, was next to go, playing down the wrong line to be bowled for 2</m15>. <m16>David Obuya became Osinde's third victim, nicking to the keeper as Kenya slid to 21 for 3</m16>. #p#<m17>There was more trouble for Kenya when a horrible swipe ended Collins Obuya's promising innings</m17>, and <m18>their most experienced player Steve Tikolo was adjudged lbw though replays suggested there was an inside-edge.</m18>. <m19>Mishra and Kamande then put on the first of two reviving half-century stands.</m19> Just as <m20>the partnership</m20> started to gather momentum, <m21>legspinner Balaji Rao struck, getting Kamande caught behind for 22</m21>. #p#<m22>Mishra continued to grind it out, holding the innings together with a carefully constructed knock - 33 of his 51 runs were singles</m22>. <m23>His second significant stand was with Thomas Odoyo</m23>, who was far more aggressive, launching the ball through the off side or down the ground when it was pitched up. #p#Smart Stats. Canada improved their record against Kenya to five wins from 16 matches. In their first nine meetings, they won just one game and lost eight. Since then, they have won four matches and lost none. <m24>Canada's win</m24> is only their second in World Cups after their 60-run win over Bangladesh in 2003. They have now won two and lost 14 of the 16 matches they've played. Kenya were dismissed for the 16th time for a score under 200 in World Cups. In 27 innings, they have scored over 200 on just 10 occasions. This is the first occasion that Kenya have passed 150 in the 2011 World Cup. <m25>Thomas Odoyo scored his first half-century</m25> in World Cups. He has scored 414 runs at an average of 24.35 in World Cup matches. He is Kenya's second-highest run getter in ODIs behind Steve Tikolo. <m26>Henry Osinde's 4 for 26</m26> is his career-best performance in ODIs and the second-best bowling display by a Canada bowler in World Cups behind Austin Codrington's 5 for 27 in the 2003 World Cup. <m27>The 19 runs scored by Kenya in the last five overs</m27> is the lowest by any team in <m28>the batting Powerplay</m28> in the World Cup (min 20 balls faced). <m29>The 132-run partnership between Ashish Bagai and Jimmy Hansra</m29> is the highest fourth-wicket stand for Canada in World Cups and the second highest fourth-wicket stand for Canada in ODIs. #p#<m30>The pair</m30> added 57 before <m31>Mishra perished in the 43rd over</m31>; Kenya missing a trick by not choosing <m32>the batting Powerplay</m32> when <m33>the two were together</m33>. That meant there was no big flourish at the death, and <m34>Kenya were bowled out on the final delivery by an inch-perfect yorker from Harvir Baidwan</m34>. #p#The chase began with the promoted Rizwan Cheema giving another short exhibition of his everything-must-go batting philosophy. <m35>He survived a first-ball lbw decision</m35>, and then <m36>whacked two fours and a six</m36> before <m37>he was bowled attempting yet another agricultural swipe.</m37> Kenya kept it tight after that on a pitch where the ball was keeping low, before the game sparked to life. #p#First, <m38>Zubin Surkari was run out by a direct hit from Kamande in the 10th over</m38>, then <m39>Ruvindu Gunasekara crunched a couple of driven boundaries</m39>, before <m40>he was reprieved by Nehemiah Odhiambo, who shelled a hard caught-and-bowled chance.</m40> <m41>Gunasekara didn't build on that, though, as two balls later he was bizarrely stumped, after beginning to take a run when the ball was in the keeper's gloves.</m41> <m42>The new batsman Hansra popped a dolly to mid-on off the second ball he faced, but that too was dropped, by Waters.</m42> In a match that was littered with poor fielding, this was the poorest miss, and it proved to be a pivotal one. <m43>Hansra celebrated the let-off with two boundaries in the over</m43>. #p#Things became sedate again after that phase, with <m44>Hansra and Bagai mainly taking the singles on a surface which was helping the spinners. Hansra brought out the big hit occasionally but Bagai was very subdued, striking only one boundary in his first 64 deliveries.</m44> Kenya started to flag as <m45>the partnership</m45> blossomed, and though there were some half-chances, Canada picked off the many freebies offered to stay firmly on course for victory. #p#Bagai started to open up as the target neared and though <m46>Hansra was dismissed with the win 19 away</m46>, Canada got their with plenty to spare to maintain their recent dominance of Kenya. #p#Match Timeline

AFP Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: Morris Ouma | Rizwan Cheema | Steve Tikolo Matches: Canada v Kenya at Delhi Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Canada | Kenya #p#The error. Only Hot Spot could have saved Steve Tikolo. And the ICC's reluctance to deploy the technology cost the Kenyan dearly. <m2>Trying to defend a delivery from Rizwan Cheema that cut in, Tikolo played forward and was beaten. It seemed like the ball had taken a faint edge before hitting the front pad in line with the middle stump. Tikolo asked for a review. Even though Hawk Eye confirmed the path of the delivery was hitting the middle stump, but what could not be established was the inside edge. The ICC can say that the DRS has improved the decision making of the umpires considerably, but without all the technology glaring errors still make their way through.</m2> #p#The reprieve. Interestingly, one man who managed to avoid suffering injustice in a similar situation was Cheema. <m3>Thomas Odoyo earned an lbw as Billy Doctrove gave the decision against him</m3> but <m4>Cheema was quick to call in the DRS. A minute later the third umpire over-ruled the decision, having observed a thick inside edge that Doctrove had missed.</m4> #p#The 'oh-yes-oh-no' moment. <m5>The next ball Cheema failed to read the slower delivery from Obuya and went for glory. David Obuya, standing at mid-off, charged confidently to his right to get under the skier. For a moment everyone thought he had it right until suddenly Obuya realised he had not read the track of the ball and turned abruptly in the opposite direction. By then it was too late. The 5,500-strong crowd, who had come to the Kotla despite the host nation not being involved, enjoyed a brief chuckle.</m5> #p#Take two. <m6>James Ngoche delivered his first ball of the World Cup. It slipped down behind the legs of Ruvindu Gunasekera, who lunged forward to flick it but fumbled and missed the ball. Maurice Ouma, the Kenya wicketkeeper quickly picked ball, tried flicking the bails swiftly, missed it, kept his smile intact and ripped the bails off a fraction before the batsman dragged his feet to regain the lost ground. Replays confirmed Ouma was the winner. Ngoche was all smiles for getting his maiden World Cup wicket off his first ball.</m6> He could have doubled the tally had Seren Waters not shelled a straight drive from Jimmy Hansra at mid-off. Jonty Rhodes, Kenya's fielding consultant at the outset of the World Cup, would have winced at mistake if he was watching. #p#Poster of the day "We don't care as long as India wins."
23	504719	Canada v Kenya, Group A, World Cup 2011, Delhi	Canada learn from their mistakes	Nagraj Gollapudi at the Feroz Shah Kotla	March 7, 2011	#p#The day before their clash in Delhi, both Kenya and Canada's captains had said their teams would play their own brands of cricket. Jimmy Kamande promised his players would be expressive and bold, while Ashish Bagai said we could expect fluency from his men. At the end of Monday's game, Kamande could barely speak, hurt and distraught; Bagai was all smiles, and even spoke a few words of Hindi. #p#Canada were the sum of their parts on Monday. Their fast bowlers ensured they kept their foot on Kenya's throat after making early inroads; their fielders remained electric and attentive to avoid any slip-ups; and in the end, their middle-order batsmen kept their heads light but focussed to snatch a comfortable victory, only their second in all World Cups. #p#Essentially, Canada finished the job they had started against Pakistan last week. Then, chasing a similar target (184), they had stumbled at the halfway stage. Sensing a victory against a bigger opponent, they had shivered in the headlights. No such nerves on Monday. It was evident that Canada had been working on their mistakes. #p#Against Sri Lanka, in their opening match, they realised how big the chasm was between an Associate and a big brother. The realisation that they needed to do more than just turn up to last in a 50-over match hit them flush in the face like a Mike Tyson punch. Then, against Zimbabwe, Bagai talked up their chances and they duly got steamrollered by a 175-run defeat. #p#But it was against Pakistan that they took a big stride toward recovery. On a turning track, against an opponent never far from being fallible, Canada fielded and bowled with fervour to restrict Pakistan to less than 200. But could their batsmen pace the innings without allowing Pakistan to gain control? You don't walk in with doubts when you are facing Shahid Afridi, and he lauded it over Canada in feudal style, whipping them into submission with his versatility as much as his aura. #p#Ashish Bagai's partnership with Jimmy Hansra ensured Canada completed the job they had started against Pakistan. Getty Images Enlarge #p#But, on Monday, it was a battle of equals; and Canada brought their best game to the table. Henry Osinde delivered the kind of spell captains yearn for from their premier bowlers; and <m1>with Kenya 57 for 5</m1>, Canada knew unless they did something completely stupid the match was theirs. #p#Luckily, they had a Plan B if things did not pan out the way they were expected to. On the eve of the match, Bagai had predicted that spin would be the dominant factor on a pitch that was devoid of any grass, in addition to being slow and low. But that never happened. Even Balaji Rao, their best spinner, who had managed to keep the Pakistan batsmen silent, couldn't do much. Still, Canada sensed they held the advantage as Kenya did not have many wickets in the bag. It was Kenya then that panicked in the end and lost their way. #p#Then, Canada made a smart move in <m2>sending the big-hitting Rizwan Cheema in to open</m2>. Though he did not last long, his brief cameo made clear the Canadian intentions: they were here to win. #p#"We had a disappointing batting display against Zimbabwe and Pakistan, and we had a chance of getting a win over Pakistan, but we were looking at the present," Bagai said after <m3>the win</m3>. "We are pretty happy with the guys who performed well. Henry bowled fantastic first-up, got us the advantage and then we pulled it back again in the Powerplay. And then two guys batted to get us over the line." #p#The two guys Bagai was talking about were himself and Jimmy Hansra. <m4>The pair added 132 for the fourth wicket</m4>, and along the way learned a few valuable lessons about constructing partnerships, which seems to be the Achilles heel of the batting line-ups of the Associate teams. "We were fortunate enough to have no run-rate pressure; four runs an over on that wicket would always be gettable if you spent some time on the wicket," Bagai said. "It was not an easy wicket to get used to, but once you were in there you could work it around." #p#Kamande admitted the loss was a bitter pill to swallow against an opponent Kenya fancied beating. "I will not hide it. Today was our most disappointing performance of the tournament," he said. #p#Bagai, who was born in Delhi, found plenty of home support at the Kotla, with his "grandparents, friends, relatives" accounting for some 50 people of the 5,500-strong crowd. Asked if he was chilled or thrilled with Canada's victory, Bagai said: "We are chilled with <m5>the win</m5>. We are looking to use this as a spark for the second half of the first round. My goal now is to get the batsmen who are performing to be consistent and leave the first round on a high."
24	504614	New Zealand v Pakistan, Group A, World Cup 2011, Pallekele	Hafeez confident of better openings	Osman Samiuddin in Pallekele	March 7, 2011	Mohammad Hafeez, and his opening partner Ahmed Shehzad, have not had a substantial partnership in this World Cup AFP Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: Mohammad Hafeez Matches: New Zealand v Pakistan at Pallekele Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Pakistan #p#Three matches in and murmurs over Pakistan's opening combination are increasing. Mohammad Hafeez and Ahmed Shehzad have put on 11, 28 and 16 against Kenya, Sri Lanka and Canada but on two occasions the middle order has bailed the side out. There is no move from the team management to change things just yet - in fact there is a commendable rigidity to stick, as much as possible, to the same winning XI - but the need for a substantial stand is growing. #p#Hafeez has looked the more fluent of the two, particularly in his 32 against Sri Lanka, where a disastrous run-out ended a promising knock. The surfaces they have come across, while good for batting, have been more competitive than some seen in the World Cup and that Hafeez concluded has also played a part. #p#"When you assess the pitch as an opener, you have to plan out what it would be like, and both pitches at Hambantota and at the Premadasa had a lot of movement and swing," Hafeez said in Pallekele, a day before his side's game with New Zealand. "We need some time to build a good partnership but you get one good delivery or a decision goes against you, which are a part of the game, and you have to take it positively. Here there has been some lateral movement with the new ball and swing as well." #p#Hafeez's return to the ODI set-up in the last English summer has brought Pakistan a sense of stability at the top, though his most productive partnership has been with Kamran Akmal, now batting at one down. Hafeez averages nearly 33 in 19 ODIs since, with a hundred - in New Zealand - and three fifties. The figures don't look outstanding, but he has chipped in otherwise, with wickets (13) and a safe presence in the field. #p#"In the three series against England, South Africa and New Zealand I think I've been consistent," Hafeez said. "It's only that I haven't performed in three World Cup matches. In one match I got run out and in another I got a bad decision. To perform in cricket you need luck other than your own potential as well sometimes." #p#A good start also gives Pakistan greater flexibility in their batting order. Because the openers have not so far come off, Pakistan has stuck with bringing Younis Khan and Misbah-ul-Haq together behind Kamran Akmal, in order to insure against a collapse. But there are indications within the camp that if the openers provide a substantial, pacy start, Abdul Razzaq or even Shahid Afridi could be pushed up the order, as high as one-down. #p#Having scored his first and only ODI hundred against tomorrow's opponents in the series in January, a change of results, Hafeez believes, is due. "As an opener I know we have not given good starts to the team, but there's no lack of confidence. We just need one good partnership to get back the confidence. We handled New Zealand's bowling very well [in New Zealand], I also scored a century against them so the confidence is very high."
24	504648	New Zealand v Pakistan, Group A, World Cup 2011, Pallekele	Our batting must improve - Misbah	Osman Samiuddin in Pallekele	March 7, 2011	#p#Misbah-ul-Haq believes Pakistan can, and must, improve further if they are to orchestrate a strong challenge for the World Cup. Pakistan are the only side in the tournament who can still boast of a 100% winning record, having won three out of three so far, but they come up against New Zealand on Tuesday in Pallekele after struggling considerably to overcome Canada in Colombo. #p#"There is always some room for improvement, and especially the way we have gone in our batting, it needs more improvement," Misbah said. Pakistan were bowled out for 184 against Canada at the Premadasa, though that was ultimately enough for a 46-run win. "Sometimes we do very good fielding if you compare it with our fielding in the past, but in patches we have done badly so our effort is to show more consistency. #p#"The conditions suited Canada in our last game, the wicket was a little bit slow and there were clouds so they exploited the conditions well, but that happens. Our batting has done well in New Zealand and against South Africa so the guys will be looking forward to it." #p#The batting will be tested further on Tuesday. The surface at the Pallekele stadium for its first ODI is expected to be faster and with more bounce than previous surfaces in Colombo and Hambantota, something New Zealand's quick bowlers might exploit against a batting line-up that struggles to cope with bounce. In August, New Zealand played a warm-up game against a Sri Lanka A side in this stadium, in which they bowled out the opposition for 91 and those who watched the game talk of bowling aimed between the throat and ribs. #p#Misbah-ul-Haq has been Pakistan's best batsman in the World Cup so far AFP Enlarge #p#"The way it looks, it's hard so it will have bounce," Misbah said, a view shared by New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori. "Exactly how it will behave is tough to say but it looks hard and has grass. We don't have stats of this ground, especially under lights, so you have no idea how the pitch will play." #p#Misbah's own batting form is mostly above reproach. He is Pakistan's leading scorer in the tournament with two fifties and his 37 was the second-highest score against Canada. He is also in the midst of a spectacular run of form against New Zealand, with six fifties in Tests and ODIs against them in New Zealand in January. His wicket will be vital. #p#"They just can't target just me, because before me there are three four batsmen who come and if they get hundreds, they can't just target me," Misbah said. "We are playing with six batsmen, so every one is important. We will be looking forward to our top order getting some runs because they did well in New Zealand so we are hoping they are going do it again." #p#There is every chance that Shoaib Akhtar will return to the XI, most likely in place of Wahab Riaz. That is probably the only change: Abdur Rehman's leg injury has healed enough for him to bowl at practice but Pakistan are not keen on risking him in a match in which they could seal a quarter-final spot with a win.
24	504657	New Zealand v Pakistan, Group A, World Cup 2011, Pallekele	Vettori aims to stop Pakistan's march	Brydon Coverdale in Pallekele	March 7, 2011	#p#Nestled in the hills a half-hour drive from Kandy, the Pallekele Stadium is so obscurely placed that even some locals have had trouble locating it. The ground is yet to host a completed innings at international level, after its first Test was washed out, and it has been hidden during the first fortnight of the World Cup. Oddly enough, when New Zealand walk out on Tuesday, they'll have a slight edge over Pakistan. #p#The New Zealanders played a warm-up match at the venue back in August, making them one of the few international sides with experience in Pallekele. They bowled out Sri Lanka A for 91 and the pace in the pitch surprised them, and when they trained at the ground on Sunday, they were again greeted by a surface with plenty of speed. #p#"We practiced on a strip four or five over [from the match pitch] and it seemed a bit pacier than what you normally expect," the captain Daniel Vettori said on Monday. "But then the nets are pretty slow and low, so we're going to have to wing it, really, because there haven't been too many games here. We played a warm-up game here last year. I think we're expecting it to be a little bit quicker than most grounds, but it will still probably be a batter-friendly wicket." #p#New Zealand enter the match in fourth position in Group A, while Pakistan are unbeaten after three games, the only side to have won all their matches so far. New Zealand are fresh from an impressive ten-wicket win against Zimbabwe and they have also beaten Kenya, and easily accounted for Ireland in the practice matches. #p#Hamish Bennett could find more pace in the Pallekele pitch than the others he's bowled on in the World Cup Getty Images Enlarge #p#However, they suffered a comprehensive defeat to Australia and were beaten by India by 117 runs in a warm-up game, and they know that to have any chance of reaching the meaningful stages of the tournament, they must beat some of the stronger sides. A win over Pakistan would be a fine way to get their World Cup heading in the right direction, but having lost at home to Pakistan this season, they know it will be a tough ask. #p#"There's always more to be done," Vettori said. "We know we've got a big game against Pakistan tomorrow. It's going to be a tough game, but hopefully there's some confidence from the Zimbabwe game. The guys played pretty well there, so if we can bring that same performance to this game, then it's going to be huge for our tournament. #p#"Pakistan know us exceptionally well as well. It was a pretty tightly fought series, in our conditions. This is more like their conditions so they're probably going to be an even better team than the one we came across. They're playing really well, so we have to find a way to beat them rather than anything else. They're going to be a tough opposition throughout the tournament."
24	504695	New Zealand v Pakistan, Group A, World Cup 2011, Pallekele	New Zealand brace for in-form Pakistan	The Preview by George Binoy	March 7, 2011	#p#Match Facts March 8, Pallekele Start time 14.30 local (09.00 GMT) #p#The fast bowlers could find the Pallekele pitch more to their liking than the ones in Colombo and Hambantota AFP Enlarge Related Links Matches: New Zealand v Pakistan at Pallekele Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: New Zealand | Pakistan #p#The Big Picture #p#The pressure on the Test teams in Group A, unlike those scrumming in Group B, is of a milder nature. The teams in Group B are securing quarter-final qualification first and looking after their positions in the process. Unless Zimbabwe scores an unlikely upset, however, all four Test teams in Group A are ensured of a place in the knockouts. They are merely jostling for places at present. Of the strongest, New Zealand are the weakest. Their opponents on Tuesday, Pakistan, are the only team to win everything so far. #p#New Zealand have beaten Kenya and Zimbabwe - by a ten-wicket margin no less - and another victory against Canada will see them through. It's that brittle performance against Australia, however, that is an indication of the difficulty they will face against formidable sides. On paper, like previous New Zealand teams, this one also has the facets of a fighting outfit. #p#They have explosive hitters, theoretically bat extremely deep, and have an abundance of bowling options, fast and slow. Their fielding, as ever, is among the best. Their problems are a combination of form, poor technique, and impatience that led to several batsmen chasing and edging wide deliveries against Australia. It's the batting that needs fixing first, for without runs on the subcontinent there is little hope, and they'll have to do it against one of the tournament's most in-form bowling attacks. #p#The odds on Pakistan being the only team with a 100% win record halfway into the league stage would have been rather high at the start of the World Cup. They weren't being talked up in the lead-up to the tournament - the spot-fixing scandal and the uncertainty over the one-day captaincy overshadowing their performances on the field. But they put Kenya and Canada away and in between those victories toppled tournament favourites Sri Lanka. #p#Their middle order has largely been solid, and the one time it failed - against Canada - their bowlers raised their game to meet the challenge. They've met and beaten New Zealand in a one-day series immediately preceeding the World cup. Play to potential and Pakistan will expect to dispatch them again tomorrow. Slip, and it could be the opening New Zealand need to rediscover their efficient game. #p#Form guide #p#(completed matches, most recent first) #p#New Zealand WLWWL #p#Pakistan WWWLW #p#Watch out for... #p#Shahid Afridi the bowler, who has been a vastly more dangerous opponent than Afridi the batsman in recent years. He is the leading wicket-taker in the tournament, with 14 from three matches, including two five-wicket hauls. He tests batsmen with legbreaks, straighter ones and googlies. And then there's the fast ball that tears at batsmen at 130 kph, leaving them no time to react if they've come ill prepared. Afridi has at least four more matches to beat Glenn McGrath's tournament record of 26 wickets - in 2007 - and needs 13 more. He, as always, is Pakistan's talisman in the field, and if New Zealand give him a foothold, he will swarm all over them. #p#Tim Southee won't be ranked high on the list of the tournament's most dangerous bowlers but he's done tidily so far, picking up seven wickets at an average of 12.42 with an economy of 3.43. He swings the ball both in and out, bowls a probing wicket-to-wicket line, and has a useful yorker during the end overs. The challenge for him, however, is to strike and maintain a low economy on the subcontinent, where conditions are different from the ones he thrives in. Pallekele is an unknown quantity and there are indications that the pitch there could be faster than elsewhere. #p#Team news #p#New Zealand completed a clinical dismantling of Zimbabwe to put their campaign back on track and there seems to be no reason to change that winning combination. Brendon McCullum suffered from some soreness but is expected to play against Pakistan. #p#New Zealand (probable) 1 Martin Guptill, 2 Brendon McCullum (wk), 3 Jesse Ryder, 4 Ross Taylor, 5 James Franklin, 6 Scott Styris, 7 Nathan McCullum, 8 Daniel Vettori, 9 Kyle Mills, 10 Tim Southee, 11 Hamish Bennett. #p#Pakistan are likely to make one change and bring back Shoaib Akhtar, who missed the game against Canada, for Wahab Riaz. Abdur Rehman, the left-arm spinner, is recovering from his leg injury but is unlikely to be risked against New Zealand. #p#Pakistan (probable) 1 Ahmed Shehzad, 2 Mohammad Hafeez, 3 Kamran Akmal (wk), 4 Younis Khan, 5 Misbah-ul-Haq, 6 Umar Akmal, 7 Abdul Razzaq, 8 Shahid Afridi, 9 Shoaib Akhtar, 10 Saeed Ajmal, 11 Umar Gul. #p#Pitch and conditions #p#Misbah-ul-Haq said the pitch was hard and had grass, indicating that there would be bounce. Daniel Vettori agreed, but no one can say for certain. Pallekele hasn't hosted an international game before. New Zealand, however, have played at the venue located in the hills near Kandy and bowled out a Sri Lanka A side for 91. The weather forecast is thankfully clear. #p#Stats and Trivia #p#Pakistan lost their first World Cup match against New Zealand in 1983. They won the next six. #p#Younis Khan averaged 21 and 12 in the previous two World Cups with a high score of 32. He's averaging 42.66 in this one with two half-centuries in three innings. #p#New Zealand's openers, Brendon McCullum and Martin Guptill, average 135 and 118 in this World Cup. They have been dismissed only once each in three innings. #p#Quotes #p#"We've not been able to put consistent team performances together. That's pretty much where we've let ourselves down in the past. Hopefully there is some confidence from the Zimbabwe game. If we can bring the same performance in this game then it's going to be huge for us in the tournament." Daniel Vettori hopes his team will build on the Zimbabwe win #p#"They just can't target me, because before me there are three or four batsmen who can get hundreds. They can't wait for me only. We are playing with six batsmen so every batsman is important." Misbah-ul-Haq attempts to divert New Zealand's focus from him.

Matches: New Zealand v Pakistan at Pallekele Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: New Zealand | Pakistan #p#The fans who travelled through the hills to watch the first one-day international in Pallekele witnessed a Pakistan team in shambles: they saw <m9>a glut of extras</m9>, <m10>three dropped catches</m10>, the worst possible display of end-over bowling and a batting implosion from a shell-shocked team. They also saw a struggling New Zealand side take advantage of their opponent's extraordinary failings, slowly at first, before Ross Taylor launched an assault so brutal that Pakistan were gutted and rendered defenseless by the end of the innings. #p#Stronger opponents would have made Pakistan regret their shoddy performance - in which Kamran Akmal played the lead and Shoaib Akhtar a supporting role - sooner in the piece, but New Zealand's batsmen did not until the end. Then, though, they did so without mercy. Martin Guptill was their solitary performer in the first half of the innings, and Taylor needed massive slices luck to get going. But <m11>in the last six overs Taylor broke free with unprecedented violence</m11>, <m12>taking 28 off a Shoaib over</m12> before <m13>plundering 30 - a new tournament record - off one from Abdul Razzaq</m13>. It began to rain sixes and fours and Pakistan's helplessness was startling as <m14>New Zealand plundered 114 off the last six overs to reach 302</m14>. #p#Pakistan's batsmen were still swooning from Taylor's rope-a-dope when they began their chase and the inevitable collapse came to pass. The contest had ended before <m15>the mandatory Powerplay</m15> was over and, after the innings had been reduced to <m16>23 for 4</m16> and <m17>66 for 6</m17>, <m18>Abdul Razzaq merely delayed the inevitable with a half-century</m18>. The only worry for New Zealand was the fitness of their captain - <m19>Daniel Vettori hobbled painfully off the field after injuring his knee in the sixth over and did not return</m19>. Taylor, who took over the captaincy, however, had ensured that Vettori's bowling wasn't needed on the day. #p#New Zealand's formidable total didn't take shape until very late though. <m20>When Pakistan's spinners dismissed Guptill and James Franklin</m20> to reduce the innings from <m21>112 for 2</m21> to <m22>113 for 4</m22>, New Zealand were slipping. <m23>When Scott Styris, who was dropped by Kamran Akmal</m23>, <m24>was trapped by an Umar Gul yorker</m24> in <m25>the first batting-Powerplay over </m25>they were only <m26>175 for 5</m26>, in sight of a middling total. That changed in a blink. #p#<m27>In the 47th over, Shoaib bowled wide deliveries, length deliveries and full tosses that Taylor savaged through cover point and over the deep-midwicket boundary.</m27> That exhibition of how not to bowl at the death was outdone by Razzaq, whose medium-pace at poor length was meat and drink for a marauding Taylor. Fielders looked on helplessly, Shahid Afridi tore his hair out metaphorically and Taylor continued to batter a ragged Pakistan. <m28>He had added 35 in 3.5 overs with Nathan McCullum</m28>, who initiated the acceleration, and <m29>then 85 in 3.4 overs with Jacob Oram</m29>, <m30>who muscled 25 off 9 balls</m30>. #p#Before the massacre was The Comedy of Errors. The litany began off <m31>the first ball of the innings, when Shoaib overstepped and umpire Nigel Llong didn't spot it.</m31> <m32>Llong called Shoaib's next three foot-faults,</m32> though, and <m33>the New Zealand batsmen sent all those free-hits to the boundary</m33>. <m34>Brendon McCullum, however, missed an incutter soon</m34> after <m35>pulling the first free-hit for six</m35> and <m36>his dismissal</m36> brought in How, playing for the unwell Jesse Ryder. #p#How's problem was he couldn't get the ball off the square. Pakistan gave the new ball to a spinner for the first time in 13 years and Abdur Rehman's left-arm darts were hard to score off. <m37>Shoaib, at the other end, was in a generous mood, throwing a ball he fielded on his follow through wide of Kamran Akmal to concede four overthrows.</m37> That Pakistan allowed 45 during <m38>the mandatory Powerplay</m38> was largely due to Shoaib's largesse. It was also due to Guptill's ability to focus despite the drama around him. He dragged New Zealand forward with no help from his partner. #p#<m39>How's misery mercifully ended in the 13th over, when Gul's incutter struck him so plumb that the ball would have hit the middle of middle stump.</m39> <m40>He'd made 4 off 29 balls</m40>. #p#<m41>In walked Taylor, on his 27th birthday, and he received two enormous gifts.</m41> <m42>Before he had scored, Taylor edged the second ball of Shoaib's second spell. Akmal moved to towards his right, then stopped and looked expectantly at first slip, where Younis Khan was in shock as the ball sped between them to the boundary.</m42> <m43>Two balls later Taylor edged again, this time the simplest of chances straight to Akmal, and survived.</m43> <m44>In between those deliveries, Taylor had slashed to the point boundary.</m44> #p#Taylor, whose early struggle was substantial by normal standards but incomparable to How's, slowly grew in confidence. Then Pakistan went to pieces and, though he shoudn't have been, Taylor was there to hurt them. <m45>He finished unbeaten on 131 off 124 balls</m45>. #p#<m46>The day's ironic moment came when Kamran Akmal edged to slip and watched Taylor, whom he had dropped twice in single digits, take a low catch without even the faintest fumble.</m46> #p#Match Timeline

"Obviously he's a key part of our team and we need him to go further in this competition. But he didn't bowl a ball today and <m9>we won</m9>, so we just have to give it a couple of days and see where he's at. Hopefully he's all right come two or three days' time." #p#Vettori is not only a key player due to his bowling on the spin-friendly surfaces of the subcontinent, but he is also a canny leader whose on-field nous would be missed if he is sidelined. If that is the case, New Zealand would look to Taylor, 27, to captain the side, as he has done in nine one-day internationals for three victories. #p#"I've captained the team in quite a few matches now," Taylor said. "We've got a lot of senior players in the team for me to look to, to get help and to bounce ideas off. We'll have to wait and see, but if it did come about it would be something that would be an honour to do. There's still a long way to go in this competition, but if that comes about then I'd grab it with both hands."

Ross Taylor turned 27 today. Then <m2>he came across Kamran Akmal, who gifted him two lives in three balls, on 0 and 4</m2>. <m3>Then he got a career-best hundred.</m3> Happy birthday Ross. #p#Sign of the day. At least one fan in the crowd was prepared for Taylor's big day, with a computer print-out that was held up as a sign. There was only one problem. It read: "Happy birthday Rose Taylor" Ah well, a Ross by any other name would smell as sweet. #p#Opening of the day. Pakistan: land of strapping, wicket-taking fast bowlers who blow through you with the new ball and clean up with the old? Perhaps not. Shahid Afridi chose to open with Abdur Rehman for the second over of the innings, the first time a spinner had bowled one of the first two overs for Pakistan in an ODI since April 1998, when Mohammad Hussain - another left-arm spinner - did so. And until <m4>his last two overs went for 34</m4>, he hadn't done such a bad job of it. #p#Communication failure of the day. The Powerplays often create headaches for captains, but it was even more so for Shahid Afridi during New Zealand's innings. <m5>After 10 overs, he seemed to believe the bowling Powerplay had started, but one ball into the over was in an animated discussion with the umpire Nigel Llong, who had not given the signal.</m5> <m6>At the start of the next over, Afridi made it clear to the other official, Daryl Harper that he wanted the Powerplay to begin.</m6> Remarkably, the same thing appeared to happen with the batting Powerplay. <m7>Afridi had only three fielders outside the circle for the first two balls of the 41st over, apparently under the impression New Zealand had taken the Powerplay.</m7> Again, Llong clarified matters, and <m8>at the start of the next over, Afridi watched closely as Harper signalled that finally the batting Powerplay was under way.</m8> #p#Atmosphere of the day. It's to be expected that not all the neutral matches in this World Cup will be well attended, but the crowd at Pallekele was wonderful. Not for nearly a decade has Kandy hosted a one-day international, and the city's only international cricket in more than three years was the horribly rain-affected Test against West Indies last year. The locals have clearly been craving the game. A big crowd turned out and cheered vociferously for both teams, roaring their support of Taylor late in the New Zealand innings. No doubt the solid numbers were helped by the price of tickets - the cheapest were only 30 rupees, which equates to approximately 27 US cents.

Players/Officials: Ross Taylor Matches: New Zealand v Pakistan at Pallekele Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: New Zealand | Pakistan #p#<m3>With his unbeaten 131</m3>, <m4>Ross Taylor became only the fourth batsman to score a century on his birthday</m4>, and his innings was second only to Sachin Tendulkar's 134 among those four hundreds. That, though, is unlikely to be the stat that would have most pleased him and New Zealand's think-tank. Far more important was the manner in which Taylor finally shrugged off a poor run and played the sort of innings which will, hopefully, inspire New Zealand onto greater things through the rest of the tournament. #p#In the two-year period beginning March 2009, Taylor had averaged 28.86 before his innings today. His highest in 39 innings had been 95, and his last ODI century had come 48 innings ago. #p#That lack of form was evident in the way Taylor started his innings - <m5>that he went beyond seven deliveries was only because of the extreme generosity (incompetence?) from Kamran Akmal</m5>. Even after that, <m6>Taylor continued to struggle, scoring only 27 off his first 50 deliveries.</m6> Off his next 58, his strike rate improved, but he still managed only one four, which meant <m7>after 108 balls, Taylor was on 69.</m7> <m8>In his last 16 deliveries, though, Taylor was completely unrecognisable from the batsman who had struggled so much early in innings.</m8> <m9>In those 16 balls, he struck seven sixes and four fours</m9>, as <m10>New Zealand scored an astonishing 114 runs in their last six overs</m10>. #p#How Taylor paced his innings Runs Strike rate 4s/ 6s Dot balls First 50 balls 27 54.00 3/ 0 33 Next 58 balls 42 72.41 1/ 0 23 Last 16 balls 62 387.50 4/ 7 2 The entire innings 131 105.65 8/ 7 58 #p#Over the course of his frenetic innings, Taylor and New Zealand knocked up several records. Here are some of the key ones: <m11>Taylor's unbeaten 131</m11> is the highest by a New Zealand batsman in an ODI against Pakistan. It equals Brendon McCullum's effort in Abu Dhabi in 2009. #p#<m12>Taylor struck seven sixes in his innings</m12>, which is the joint third-highest in ODIs for New Zealand, and their best in World Cups. <m13>His blitz</m13>, and <m14>Jacob Oram's late contribution</m14>, meant New Zealand's innings had 13 sixes, which is their best in a World Cup game. #p#<m15>Taylor's 85-run partnership with Oram consumed all of 22 deliveries, which makes it the fastest 50-plus partnership</m15> in ODIs since 1998. It betters an effort by one of their own: against the USA in 2004, Nathan Astle and Craig McMillan put together 136 in 7.4 overs, a run rate of 17.73 runs per over, which pales when compared with today's effort of 23.18 runs per over. #p#During the course of that stunning assault, two overs were particularly brutal: <m16>in the 49th, Abdul Razzaq deluged 30, including three sixes, two fours, and a couple of wides</m16>; <m17>a couple of overs earlier, Taylor had taken 28 off Shoaib Akhtar.</m17> <m18>Those two overs </m18>have become the most expensive of this World Cup, going past the earlier record of 25, by Bernard Loots against South Africa, and Sreesanth's 24 in the tournament opener against Bangladesh. #p#<m19>The 114 runs added in the last six overs</m19> is the second-highest in ODIs since 2000, but the best against a top side. New Zealand had scored 122 against USA in the match mentioned above. #p#The break-up of his runs against each bowler also shows how uneven his innings was. <m20>Against the magnificent Umar Gul, Taylor did little damage</m20>, while Mohammad Hafeez kept his quiet too. <m21>Razzaq and Shoaib, though, went at more than two runs per ball.</m21> #p#Taylor against each bowler Bowler Runs Balls Strike rate 4s/ 6s Umar Gul 9 26 34.61 0/ 0 Mohammad Hafeez 12 23 52.17 0/ 0 Abdur Rehman 8 12 66.67 0/ 0 Shahid Afridi 30 32 93.75 1/ 1 Shoaib Akhtar 36 16 225.00 4/ 3 Abdul Razzaq 36 15 240.00 3/ 3 #p#<m22>The result</m22> also means New Zealand have at last ended their losing streak in World Cup games against Pakistan - they'd lost six in a row before today's game. The margin of defeat is Pakistan's second-worst in a World Cup game, and it was only the late resistance by Razzaq that prevented this from becoming their worst loss. #p#The four teams that will progress from group A are pretty much decided, but with this result the battle for top spot in the group suddenly becomes much more interesting.

24	504885	New Zealand v Pakistan, World Cup 2011, Pallekele	Calamity Kamran seems undroppable	Osman Samiuddin in Pallekele	March 8, 2011	#p#How to approach this politely? Ian Chappell was pretty polite. "If his batting was as good as Don Bradman's," he said on air, "he couldn't score enough runs to make up for what he costs them with his keeping." #p#There are many ways in which the depth of denial in Pakistan - in all spheres of life - presents itself to the observer. No better example of it exists than the continued presence of Kamran Akmal in the side, the man to whom Chappell refers so politely. The world knows the worth of Akmal as a wicketkeeper: to be short, he is not one anymore. He is, to steal and twist the wonderful sledge Jimmy Ormond dished out to Mark Waugh once, not even the best wicketkeeper in his family. He's not even the second-best: Umar Akmal has looked safer than him on the occasions he has kept. #p#Yet as Pakistan has changed everything about its cricket over the last four years - captains, selectors, chairmen, players, coaches - Akmal has remained unchanged, unchallenged in his incompetency. Until the beginning of Pakistan's last summer in England, when there was still a will left to count, he was fluffing comfortably more than one chance per Test: 32 in 25 Tests. His ODI rate cannot be far behind. #p#There appears no sane reason for it and even an insane one right now would be handy. Shoaib Malik thought him the second-best wicketkeeper-batsman behind Adam Gilchrist during his captaincy, a hallucination rather than delusion. The pair are close, so nepotism was as good a reason as any. But what were the reasons for Younis Khan, Mohammad Yousuf, Salman Butt and now, Shahid Afridi to persist with him? #p#After every show of calamity, when the question is put to anyone in charge, the response is to say it is only one match, that everyone drops a catch occasionally, or the line Waqar Younis trotted out today, that we can't just blame the one person. We can at least blame those who keep selecting him. Those who argue that he compensates with his batting will kindly direct themselves to the brutality of Chappell's verdict: no amount of runs can make up for the matches, and as importantly the moments in matches, he has lost. #p#Despite consistently letting his side down, Kamran Akmal has been a mainstay of Pakistan's team over the last few years. Getty Images Enlarge #p#The few times he has been dropped in the last four years - for the Asia Cup 2008, after the Australia tour last year, during the English summer - the performances leading into it have been so monumentally negligent that not dropping him might have risked the kind of revolution in Pakistan seen in the Arab world. It would probably take that still to shift him. #p#In any case he has returned back to the side at the first opportunity. Whether they forget or choose to overlook his errors is irrelevant: it is criminal in both cases. He sneaked into this squad only after being cleared by a board integrity committee. A wicketkeeping committee might have been better placed to rule on it. #p#<m1>Akmal's three misses</m1> - <m2>two off Ross Taylor</m2> - set the tone for the rest of the innings, Pakistan's most bedraggled performance in the field in this tournament so far. Their last one, against Sri Lanka, was sparked incidentally by two missed stumpings. #p#Short of injuring Akmal and sending him back, the only option Pakistan could explore is to play the younger Akmal as a wicketkeeper. In keeping with the cautious nature of the team's leaders, that seems unlikely. Asked whether they would consider it, Waqar Younis said, "After the World Cup maybe we can think about it, but we are in the middle of the tournament and I don't think we can make such a change. We have five days off in which we will try to rectify his mistakes because in such a short time we can't rectify all mistakes. We can't kick him out at the moment, we can try to make him better for the next game and make sure he won't make the same mistakes." #p#Meanwhile, the state of denial Pakistan remains in about the balance of its side should also take a few knocks here, hopefully. They persist in playing a specialist bowler short to buffer their batting. Playing a batsman at eight - Abdul Razzaq may open the bowling but he is no opening bowler, as tournament figures of 21-4-111-1 testify - has not helped their batting much in their last two games, precisely the situations the strategy is aimed at. <m3>Razzaq's 62</m3> will, no doubt, be used as justification at some point in the future. #p#When Umar Gul had to be bowled out during the batting Powerplay - and his fine bowling will not even be a footnote - it left the last four overs to be bowled by someone who wasn't Gul. <m4>Those four overs, shared by Razzaq, Shoaib Akhtar and Abdur Rehman, went for 92.</m4> <m5>Razzaq's four overs of the day went for 49</m5>, "a bit off-colour" Waqar said: a little yes, like black and white. #p#Yet the top order collapse seemed to confirm to Pakistan they need the batting. "<m6>We were 120-7 </m6>so we were short of batsmen," Waqar said. "I think 300 was chaseable. We can't afford to have another bowler in the side, as we are playing with six if you consider Mohammad Hafeez and Razzaq. I don't think we can manage another bowler."
24	504887	New Zealand v Pakistan, Group A, World Cup 2011, Pallekele	Good Ross, bad Ross	Brydon Coverdale	March 8, 2011	#p#<m1>Ross Taylor's seven searing sixes</m1> will be the enduring image of Pallekele's first one-day international. The fact that <m2>Taylor flailed early in his innings, with his feet glued to the ground</m2>, that <m3>he was dropped and missed again by Kamran Akmal</m3>, that <m4>he skied another top-edge and was lucky it landed safely</m4>, will fade into the haze around Kandy's hills. All that mattered was <m5>those seven strikes that cleared the boundary from square leg to midwicket in the final six overs</m5>. #p#One spectator might even have pocketed a souvenir, after the ball disappeared over a stand next to the electronic scoreboard and into the trees behind it, never to return. Twenty20 cricket has made ridiculously fast scoring passé, yet the way Taylor finished his innings still felt like something special. Having scratched his way to <m6>69 from 108 deliveries</m6>, he made a scarcely believable <m7>62 from his last 16</m7>. It was like he suddenly realised he was better than that. <m8>His partnership with Jacob Oram</m8> had the best strike-rate of any 50-plus stand in ODI history. #p#Taylor makes the kind of mistakes that great batsmen don't, but some fine batsmen can't do things that come naturally to Taylor. Most impressive was his timing in those final stages of the innings, when <m9>28 came off a Shoaib Akhtar over</m9> and <m10>30 off the next over from the same end, bowled by Abdul Razzaq</m10>. The boundary was short and the bowlers helped by sending down low full tosses, but many players would still have skied a catch. #p#New Zealand supporters have been galled as much as enthralled by their captain-in-waiting in recent times. In the two years up until this match, he was averaging 28.80 in one-day internationals, nowhere near enough for the man who should be the best in the team. <m11>He chose a good time to score his first hundred</m11> since mid-2008, and not just because it was his 27th birthday. #p#<m12>Ross Taylor's century</m12> in Pallekele was his first since 2008. AFP Enlarge #p#After thrashing Kenya and Zimbabwe, but being soundly defeated by Australia, New Zealand needed to beat one of the stronger sides to prove to themselves that they could compete in this World Cup. And, though he didn't know it while <m13>he was compiling his career-best 131</m13>, Taylor might have to lead the side in their upcoming matches if a knee injury sustained by Daniel Vettori in the field turns out to be serious. #p#If that is the case, he should at least be full of confidence. He wasn't at the start of his innings. Too often when Taylor comes to the crease, he tries to play strokes that he should save for later. <m14>His fifth ball was edged between Kamran and slip</m14>, <m15>his seventh drew an edge that most wicketkeepers in Under-13 cricket would take, but Kamran spilled</m15>, and he slashed cuts just out of reach of point off Shahid Afridi. #p#But good Ross and bad Ross often cohabit in the same innings. <m16>When he brought up his hundred</m16> with <m17>a pull for six off Akhtar, Taylor squatted close to the ground, catching his breath and feeling the relief of ending his century drought</m17>. #p#"I had a bit of luck early on," Taylor said. "My first 50, 60 or 70 balls I felt like I struggled and just tried to guts my way through, and probably caught up in those last 25 or 30 balls, which made my score look a lot better and made my day a lot better as well. #p#"It's been well documented back home that I haven't been in the greatest form of my life. It's been frustrating for myself, and probably a lot of others as well. When you're out of nick you need a bit of luck and I got that today. Over the last few months I've been trying to search for the perfect game. I've just tried to keep things as simple as possible and just watch the ball. Today was my day." #p#There is no question that it was Taylor's day, and <m18>when Vettori left the field in the sixth over of Pakistan's chase</m18>, it was Taylor who captained the side to <m19>victory</m19>. New Zealand just need good Ross to turn up for the rest of the tournament.
24	504937	New Zealand v Pakistan, World Cup 2011, Pallekele	'Don't think we should panic' - Waqar	Osman Samiuddin at Pallekele	March 9, 2011	<m1>Shoaib Akhtar did not enjoy Kamran Akmal dropping Ross Taylor off his bowling</m1>. Associated Press Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: Waqar Younis Matches: New Zealand v Pakistan at Pallekele Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Pakistan #p#Waqar Younis did well to appear considerably composed and calm after <m2>a thumping defeat</m2> that revealed the true fragility of Pakistan's challenge in this World Cup. Pakistan's coach even played along with a couple of Kamran Akmal jokes, of which there were many. #p#He has seen days like this in his own time, days when Pakistan unravel so swiftly and so completely, everyone feels like a fool for thinking, hey, they're looking good as a unit. But there is something about Waqar these days, a thoughtfulness and patience even, not apparent in his early, brasher years, which might just hold them in good stead over the next couple of days. #p#There was much appreciation of an <m3>incredible innings from Ross Taylor</m3> and a noble attempt to deflect blame from Akmal, a man least in need of avoiding blame. Shahid Afridi, at around the same time, was telling a Pakistani channel that Umar Akmal may be used as a wicketkeeper in forthcoming games. But the core message was that they need not become despondent yet. #p#"We are not going to panic here," Waqar said. "That's the important thing because if we panic here we're really going to struggle in this tournament. There are still big games to come, we've got Australia to handle and then we've got a quarter-final if we get there, so I don't think we should panic about it. We had a bad day. We should stop here and look forward." #p#The sense early on in the game was clear: some days Pakistan turn up and some days they don't. This was one of those when they didn't. <m4>Shoaib Akhtar bowled no-balls</m4>, there were wides and overthrows and misfields. The energy that had been apparent in the field in three games was considerably down and slipped further with each Akmal fumble. Afridi seemed irate, distracted. #p#Ahmed Shehzad, usually the bounciest in the field, was invisible, weighed down, no doubt, by three failures with the bat. The sun - this was the first time Pakistan had fielded during the day - seemed to drain them. <m5>Shehzad's form, and partnership with Mohammad Hafeez</m5>, is now officially under the scanner. In four games, the pair have put on 11, 28, 16 and now 5. #p#"We've got five days to recover from <m6>this defeat, it's a big defeat</m6>," Waqar said. "We've got to sit down and start talking rather than practicing because it's not on. We need to really start delivering when you talk about the opening slot, even if we have to make any changes. We might do that, yes, because it's been a worry for the Pakistan team for the last couple of matches that the opening has really not given a decent start, and that's why we are suffering." #p#No doubt Waqar will also bring his own considerable expertise of bowling at the death to bear now, in the harsh light of an assault that saw 100 runs given away in five, scarcely believable overs. New Zealand's timing of <m7>the batting Powerplay</m7> was cunning, forcing Afridi to bowl out himself and Umar Gul, their best bowler on the day. But Waqar would still have expected more from Shoaib and Abdul Razzaq than the buffet of thigh and waist-high full tosses they eventually served up. #p#"<m8>The drops</m8> were a big turning point, without a doubt," he said. "To give chances to somebody like Ross Taylor, who's a top player in their side, <m9>two chances in three balls</m9> really cost us, but we bowled poorly also in the end. <m10>A couple of overs from Shoaib and Razzaq really, 50-60 runs in two overs</m10> and you don't expect to win after that. We didn't bowl at the right areas where we needed to bowl in the block hole and with more variations, slower ones." #p#They are in trouble, but only if they stay as defensive as they have done so far. "We have five days to recover and think about it and don't do the mistakes which we did in this game. The tournament is still wide open, we started well and won three games. I don't think we should worry that much that we are not going to qualify for the quarterfinals but definitely we want to get some of the momentum from here on and make sure we win the rest of our games."
24	504959	New Zealand v Pakistan, World Cup 2011, Pallekele	Umar may replace Kamran as wicketkeeper	Osman Samiuddin in Pallekele	March 9, 2011	Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi thinks it may be time to replace Kamran Akmal behind the stumps.

Players/Officials: Kamran Akmal | Shahid Afridi | Umar Akmal Matches: New Zealand v Pakistan at Pallekele Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Pakistan #p#Pakistan will consider using Umar Akmal as a wicketkeeper in their remaining group games in the World Cup in a bid to offset <m1>the disastrous glovework of his elder brother Kamran</m1>. <m2>Akmal senior missed three chances in Tuesday's big loss to New Zealand</m2>, <m3>including the centurion Ross Taylor twice in three balls when he was on 0 and 4</m3>. #p#Those chances come on the back of two missed stumpings in the win against Sri Lanka and over four years of constant, error-strewn performances. "It [keeping with Umar] is very much an option and we might try it in the next game," captain Shahid Afridi told Geo News. #p#As a sign of Pakistan's concern over Kamran's form with gloves and bat - he has only three dismissals so far and averages less than 30 as a batsman - Afridi did not rule out the possibility not playing him as a specialist batsman and dropping Kamran altogether. "We have five days now before our next game, so whatever is better for the team we will try it," he said. #p#Kamran is the only specialist wicketkeeper in the squad but Umar kept for the side in one ODI against South Africa last November, after Zulqarnain Haider fled to London. He was also behind the wickets for three T20s in New Zealand soon after. #p#"If you see him train, he puts in a lot of hard work. I don't know why but luck has deserted him," Afridi said. "He is also upset about his performance [against New Zealand] and he realizes it too." Asked by the channel how "luck" seems to have deserted him so often in the last four years, Afridi smiled and said, "I can't give an exact answer to that. My job is to back him, to support him and hopefully he will do his best." #p#If he is dropped, it will not be the first time in the last four years it has happened to Kamran. After a promising couple of years as the first-choice replacement for Moin Khan and Rashid Latif, Akmal's performances began to dip on the 2006 trip to England, where he persisted behind the stumps despite a finger injury. #p#But Pakistan stuck with him until June 2008, when Sarfraz Ahmed kept for the side in the Asia Cup. Kamran returned soon after, however, with no discernible improvement in performance. Only in January 2010 was he next axed and it took the monumental failure of the Sydney Test, where he missed five chances in all, for Sarfraz to be flown out for the final Test in Hobart. #p#In Pakistan's next Test against Australia at Lord's last summer, Kamran was back again, however. After three more poor Tests, Zulqarnain Haider came in to replace him, but a contentious finger injury ruled him out after his debut. Yet again, Kamran returned to keep wickets in the last two Tests of the summer. #p#He was subsequently caught up in the fall-out of the spot-fixing scandal and the PCB refused to clear his selection for the series against South Africa in the UAE and the third Akmal brother, Adnan, took his place in the two Tests. But the board's integrity committee finally cleared him in December, allowing for his selection in the ODI series against New Zealand and the World Cup squad. #p#His long-term future is again under question now. After the game, Waqar Younis, the coach, said "After the World Cup maybe we can think about it, but we are in the middle of the tournament and I don't think we can make such a change right now." #p#Pakistan took a day off from training on Wednesday but the team management said it would sit down and go through the loss and plan for the next game, against Zimbabwe on March 14.

Getty Images Enlarge Related Links News : Umar Akmal uncertain for Zimbabwe clash. News : All eyes on the brothers. Akmal News : Umar may replace Kamran as wicketkeeper Analysis : Calamity Kamran seems undroppable. Players/Officials: Kamran Akmal | Shahid Afridi Matches: New Zealand v Pakistan at Pallekele Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Pakistan #p#Like a particularly spicy nihari , heavy defeats often have a wonderful way of unclogging the head. The fog lifts, everything becomes clearer, easier to comprehend and suddenly there is a flow, a way forward. <m1>Pakistan's loss to New Zealand</m1> revealed the folly three wins had clouded, one a long-running personnel issue, the other a question of strategy. #p#But in the here and now, for Pakistan, the result has only muddled matters further, because both flaws are linked, one stemming from the other. The more Pakistan persist with Kamran Akmal the more matches he will cost them, that is a simple truth and cannot be argued. But he is in the squad now and is the only - as much as this is an inaccurate statement - specialist wicketkeeper. They have to suffer him. #p#The reason they must do so, it is becoming clear, is because they have even less faith in their batting than most people do in Kamran's wicketkeeping. Until the last two games, the batting had actually performed with some solidity over the last few months. The resulting logic from 184 all out against Canada and <m2>120 for seven against New Zealand</m2> is not that the top order should simply begin scoring, or that if the top six or seven fail, No.8 will rarely salvage matters. It is that more batsmen are needed. #p#There is no ostensible panic yet, but there is confusion and uncertainty, apparent at a dinner with Shahid Afridi on Wednesday evening. The captain had hinted immediately after the New Zealand game that Umar Akmal would be considered an option as a wicketkeeper. On Wednesday, Afridi appeared truly in a bind: he doesn't want to risk Kamran again but neither does he want to risk another batting flop, even if Kamran's batting contributions are not as substantial anymore as they are remembered. #p#He was supportive, as captains must be. "Kamran's performance is in front of everyone, he is putting in the hard work in the training sessions and he has done a lot of work for this World Cup, but he has not lived up to that level," he said. "We suffered a lot after he could not perform." #p#Then there was the glossing over, the retreat into lazy myths. "But I must say he has won lots of matches for Pakistan in the past, he is a very talented cricketer. We are at a stage where we should not panic, there are other players who are not performing it's not only Kami and we need to back them." #p#The conclusion? We don't know. "We will see if he plays the next game or not that we will see later on, but from my side I think we should give Kamran confidence because he is a good player, a good cricketer and there are lots of expectations that he will do good." #p#The failures of Mohammad Hafeez and Ahmed Shehzad twist the problem further. There is casual talk of dropping Shehzad, for example, and pushing Kamran to open. They could retain the openers and drop Kamran, using Umar behind the stumps. In both cases a spot opens up: bowler or batsman? #p#That another bowler is unlikely still is the only thing there appears to be some firmness on, despite them so missing one against New Zealand. "I don't think we are playing with a bowler short," Afridi said, before, like the rest of the team management, simply pretending Abdul Razzaq's bowling is not a problem. "We mostly struggle in batting and when we play less then people say we are playing with a batsman short, I think the combination with which we are playing is the balanced one. If you see bowlers Razzaq and Shoaib Akhtar are bowling well with the new ball, then we have Umar Gul, we have every type of variety." #p#For what it's worth, the younger Akmal, Umar, practiced with the gloves on Thursday in Kandy but so did Kamran. "We might change or even carry on with the same openers," Afridi said and he was even asked whether he could open himself. "If we make too many changes and start panicking it will be problem for us. Hafeez and Shehzad are not clicking, they need some runs. We are here with perfect openers and I don't think we can take that chance [of his opening]. Shehzad and Hafeez are there but we might open with Kamran Akmal too." #p#Nothing is clear, everything is on the table. They may do nothing at all ahead of the Zimbabwe game on Monday and there is a general mood of support within the team for Kamran. With just one loss, who's to say, in the light of day, they would be wrong in doing so? And who's still to write off their chances? #p#Afridi, who better captures the ways of Pakistan cricket and cricketers than many others, knows it. "If you look at Pakistan cricket over the last 50-60 years this is quite a normal performance of our team. But this is now done, it's enough and we have no chance to repeat such performances. #p#Against good teams and in pressure matches my boys play very well, like the game against Sri Lanka. I'm still looking at my team in the semi-final."

In the first match of the World Cup, in Dhaka, he nearly became the second batsman after Sachin Tendulkar to reach the milestone, before succumbing on 175. Still, he had lasted for 47.3 overs and if not for cramps, could have batted through the innings. But will Sehwag use his (home) advantage against a featherweight like Netherlands and go for the double? One Dutchman wants it to make it difficult for him, even if Netherlands lack an incisive bowling attack. #p#"For the opening batter to face us, it is quite tricky because there is no pace on the ball, which is very different to what they are quite used to," Ryan ten Doeschate, Netherlands' best player, told ESPNcricinfo. ten Doeschate was not being cocky, he was simply basing his thoughts on the experience of bowling to Chris Gayle and AB de Villiers, a devastating pair of batsmen who both possess similar ability to Sehwag to rip apart a bowling attack. Gayle faced the Dutch at the Feroz Shah Kotla , but could only manage a sedate 80 off 100 balls even though he lasted till the 36th over. Then de Villiers blasted South Africa out of misery from 58 for 2 in the 16th over, but even he could only rake up 134 in his 30-over stay. #p#According to ten Doeschate, even if the Dutch lack real quick bowlers, their trundlers have actually posed more problems for opposition line-ups with their lack of pace. "We have actually conceded two centuries in the last three games so that is not actually that bad," he said (both those hundreds were scored in the South Africa match by Hashim Amla and de Villiers). "So we are a difficult team to score hundreds against. Yes, there has been a few times when there was a real possibility like Chris Gayle or AB [de Villiers] going for the 200. But we are little better than conceding a double hundred to anyone in 50-over cricket." #p#He was not entirely ruling out Sehwag achieving the landmark feat if the Indian decided to bat out the innings. Sehwag has shown in the recent past that he can bide his time in the first ten overs before opening up. "That can only be bad news for me as I am the one-change bowler," ten Doeschate said with a big laugh. Still, he was confident. "Our starts have been pretty decent barring the England game where the guys have smashed us. We have conceded runs, but not big." The numbers don't quite confirm that, however. The West Indies racked up 95 for no loss in the first 15 overs (England were 90 for no loss), but Netherlands did manage to restrict South Africa to 58 for 1. #p#In the absence of an experienced fast man, the Dutch have found it difficult to get breakthroughs early, which has allowed their opponents to steadily establish a platform and then accelerate over the last 15 overs. West Indies raised 140 in their final 15 overs while South Africa plundered 166. "We have not taken wickets upfront. That is what really is hurting us," ten Doeschate said. #p#So what are the mistakes he would not like the team to repeat against India? "In the first game we got a lot of things right. Sometimes it is very easy look at the result and judge your performance by the result. But we have not done too much wrong. Unfortunately that is the way we bowl, we don't have express pace, we don't have guys who turn the ball miles. We have conceded 330 twice in a row, but there is nothing much we can do. #p#"On the batting side we have been done by pace twice. Again that is not something we can learn overnight how to play guys who play at 150kph. So I don't think we can put a finger and say this is what we need to get better that." #p#Like many Associates, the Dutch also do not want to go back empty handed. And they do not want to waste the opportunity of playing the bigger countries. Hence, they are not afraid to be part of the Group of Death. "This is definitely the tougher group," ten Doeschate said. "Our intention was to sneak a result out of one of the big teams and then beat Bangladesh and Ireland. From the experience point of view to play South Africa, India, England and West Indies is an awesome teams to play against." #p#Tomorrow, the Dutch will have the unique experience of playing the second-best one-day team in the world in front of a full house. The biggest match the Dutch have played in front of a virtually packed stadium came on June 5, 2009, when they shocked England in the World Twenty20 at Lord's. But playing India in India in front of a raucous crowd is like being on a different planet. Little wonder ten Doeschate was eagerly looking forward to getting on the field. #p#"We are under a bit of pressure not to make fools of ourselves, but that is obviously a different pressure to perform consistently and make sure you progress. I genuinely believe it is more about something to look forward to than to fear. As a cricketing experience it can't any bigger than that. It is a tremendous privilege."
25	504847	India v Netherlands, Group B, World Cup 2011, Delhi	India look for easy win after close games	The Preview by Nagraj Gollapudi	March 8, 2011	MS Dhoni has been tightlipped about his team selection through the tournament AFP Enlarge Related Links Features : India must experiment with bowling combination News : ten Doeschate looking forward to Sehwag challenge Matches: India v Netherlands at Delhi Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: India | Netherlands #p#Match facts March 9, Delhi Start time 2.30 pm (0900 GMT) #p#Big Picture #p#India are in no mood to take this game lightly. MS Dhoni made it clear that he wants an easy ride in Delhi compared to the uncertain drives in Bangalore. They remain the only team in their group yet to lose a match. Barring Dhoni and Yusuf Pathan - both of whom have played useful cameos - all their batsmen have got either a century or a half-century under their belts in the tournament. Even if their bowling machine has not operated smoothly, it is being fine-tuned and they could well make a change or two for Wednesday. #p#The Netherlands is a nation of about 16 million people, mostly a quiet lot, who only bare their emotions when football is on. The cricketers are usually immune to noise, since they play most of their cricket indoors. So there is little doubt that Peter Borren's men will feel intimidated when they walk out in front of a hostile crowd of 42,000, which might sound like a million. But Borren wants his troops to be brave. #p#More than heart, Netherlands' players need to keep their head, and remain focussed. Ryan ten Doeschate, with his fighting knock against England in their first match, is their only batsman to score a century in this World Cup, while Tom Cooper is the only other player to get past fifty. India might have come out of a tight contest against the spirited Irish, but the reason they have been among the best teams in the world in the last two years is because they do not repeat their mistakes. If Netherlands have to stand strong, they need their collective best. #p#Form guide (completed matches, most recent first) India: WTWLL Netherlands: LLLLL #p#Watch out for... Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir will be playing in front of their home crowd at the Feroz Shah Kotla, but both Delhiites have poor records at the ground: Sehwag has a highest score of 42 in four innings, while Gambhir has scored 31 runs in two innings. Both have spoken about how each one derives inspiration from the other partner while playing in Tests, and tomorrow they wouldn't mind sharing a good home run. #p#Pieter Seelaar is best known for his penguin dance after Netherland's historic win against England at Lord's during the 2009 World Twenty20. Since then, he has grown into a stable left-arm spinner. All the attention is likely to be on Ryan ten Doeschate's all-round skills tomorrow, and that can only be good news for Seelaar, who has been the lone spinner Netherlands have played so far in the tournament. He has been impressive in the tournament so far, and the last time Netherlands played in Delhi, against West Indies, he managed figures of 3 for 45, when every other bowler in his side went for more than six runs an over. #p#Team news Will R Ashwin play ahead of Piyush Chawla? Will Ashish Nehra finally play his first game of the tournament? No hints were given by MS Dhoni during his pre-match press conference. Considering that India play South Africa on Saturday in an important match, one that could determine the group seedings, India could think of giving Zaheer Khan a rest. But it won't surprise anyone if they stick to the winning unit. #p#India (probable): 1 Virender Sehwag, 2 Sachin Tendulkar, 3 Gautam Gambhir, 4 Virat Kohli, 5 Yuvraj Singh, 6 MS Dhoni (wk/capt), 7 Yusuf Pathan, 8 Harbhajan Singh, 9 Zaheer Khan/Ashish Nehra, 10 Piyush Chawla/R Ashwin, 11 Munaf Patel #p#For Netherlands, the missing link has been a second spinner. They have steadfastly stuck to the four-seamers-one-spinner combination. But based on the slowness of the pitch at the Kotla, they could include an extra slow bowler in Adeel Raja, who is one of only two players in the current squad who was in the side that played India in the 2003 World Cup. Raja took two wickets in that game, though India won by 68 runs. #p#Netherlands (probable): 1 Alexei Kervezee, 2 Wesley Barresi (wk), 3 Tom Cooper, 4 Ryan ten Doeschate, 5 Bas Zuiderent, 6 Tom de Grooth, 7 Peter Borren (capt), 8 Mudassar Bukhari, 9 Pieter Seelaar, 10 Bernard Loots/Adeel Raja, 11 Berend Westdijk. #p#Pitch and conditions Big runs are imminent on what should be a flatbed. But the low bounce and the slowness in the track, witnessed in the previous three matches played here, will keep the batsmen on their toes. #p#Stats and trivia India have won one and lost one game in Delhi in World Cups. There have been only three day-night matches in Delhi (all three in the 2011 World Cup) of which two have been won by the side chasing. #p#Sachin Tendulkar needs just 18 runs to reach the 2000-run landmark in World Cups. He has scored 1982 runs at 58.29 with five centuries and 13 fifties. #p#Quotes "So far we have had a good game, a tight game and a close game. We have shown signs of improvement. What we need now [on Wednesday] is an easy win." MS Dhoni expresses his calm before the clash with the Dutch. #p#"We are going to play brave cricket. Initially, our philosophy was to get out there and take the opposition on and hopefully put them on the back foot. We are going to go out there and try and cause a surprise." Peter Borren raises the war cry ahead of Netherland's "toughest" contest.
25	504873	India v Netherlands, Group B, World Cup 2011, Delhi	India must experiment with bowling combination	Sharda Ugra in Delhi	March 8, 2011	#p#The country that gave the world 'total football' has come up with another catchphrase for a sport that is most detached from the land of Cryuff, clogs and cheese. Peter Borren calls it 'brave cricket'. Netherlands captain Borren used the phrase several times as he fronted the largest mass of media he ever has in his career, at the Feroz Shah Kotla. 'Brave cricket' was what his team would need, he said, when they meet India at the Kotla on Wednesday. #p#Netherlands will be up against the hosts in front of a crowd that will convey via every cheer and hand-clap that they believe that Netherlands are at the World Cup merely to fill the numbers; that for India, Netherlands are merely a box to be ticked off. #p#Borren's men have had a rough World Cup, unable to make an impression after their first game, in which they gave England a scare. When Borren talked about being 'brave', he was referring to his team pushing their skills to the edge, rather than finding reserves of extra courage. In events like the World Cup, smaller teams often jump into uneven contests with complete optimism. It is the bigger outfit that must walk onto the ground not merely looking the part but playing it. #p#India are the only team in their group not to have lost a game, though they dropped a point against England, and their place in the quarter-finals will be as good as secure should they beat Netherlands. However, India must look at the game as something more than just one they need to win, but one in which they can try something different in the bowling department, which has been an area of concern so far in the tournament. #p#MS Dhoni was in Mr Quick Quote mode when he summarised India's World Cup so far as being "a tight game, a close game and a good win." What was due now he said, with the smile that has launched a thousand endorsements, was an "easy game" It would be perfect for the side, yet should it come by taking the easy route, that would be something of a cop-out. More than an option, going by how the Indian bowling has panned out over the last two weeks, experimentation would perhaps be common sense. #p#In keeping with cricket's ancient social orders, experimentation for India, in this event, means that it is the bowlers who must lump it. All barring Zaheer Khan, of course, who through his indispensability these days could surely lay claim to the title of Indian cricket's most-valuable player ahead even of the team's most feted batsmen. Other than Zaheer, India's most impactful bowler so far in three games has been the part-timer Yuvraj Singh, while the rest have mostly been works in not-very-rapid progress. #p#It may be time for R Ashwin to get a go ahead of Piyush Chawla AFP Enlarge #p#Ashish Nehra's comeback is awaited, Munaf Patel must demonstrate he can lead, Harbhajan Singh must fill in his wickets column, Piyush Chawla is finding that bowling on a turner in a warm-up is not the same as trying to rein in England on a belter, while Sreesanth must once again understand that being liked and picked are somehow interconnected. #p#It is time to give R Ashwin a go, not because the commentariat wants it, or experts are filling in hundreds of column inches or that it is the tea-stall talk, but because it is the logical option. Cricket teams are not, and rightly so, political parties who must go with the popular mood. There are times though that popular opinion may be the most appropriate one. To turn away from it, merely because it is popular, is to respond not to logic but to ego. There is only one way to see if Ashwin's wicket-taking ability has not melted away and that is by giving him a game. #p#Dhoni said he "did not want to bring any particular bowler under pressure" and thought he saw "signs of improvement." India will, he indicated, keep juggling combinations and "hopefully, we will have the best attack by the end of the league stage." Hopefully for their breathless public, 'hopefully' is not the operative word for India in this World Cup. #p#If India can lay claim to having structure and balance in some areas, it is, not surprisingly, in their batting. It is now clearly established that the No. 4 and No. 5 slot will be switched between Virat Kohli and Yuvraj Singh depending on the state of play, and Dhoni and Yusuf Pathan are ready to float along too. Should wickets fall early, Kohli goes in at No. 4 to be given the time and breadth to construct an innings of the kind that has made him the fastest Indian to a 1000 one-day runs. Should the innings need a lift in the run-rate, it will be Yuvraj who goes in at No. 4, like he did in the match against England, a move that is believed to have been made on coach Gary Kirsten's prompting. Dhoni virtually stated on Tuesday that Suresh Raina would be unable to squeeze into the XI should things stay the same. #p#The "signs of progress" that Dhoni sees in the bowling were somewhat more evident in the measured Indian batting versus Ireland, where the India batsmen, for a change, ran more singles than their feisty competitors. #p#The logic and success rate of sticking to a winning combination is a hard one to argue against at most times. Yet, in a six-week long World Cup, gaps between games may be long but the windows of opportunity to try different things are fewer. The match versus Netherlands is one of those windows for India. After Wednesday, all dramatic changes in personnel will come either from injury or panic. That cricket will not be so brave.

The Indian bowling was just about tidy against some dour Netherlands batting, and their bunch of big hitters came unstuck for a while against the left-arm spin of Pieter Seelaar in a low-intensity match. #p#Chasing 190, <m8>India raced out of the blocks with Sachin Tendulkar becoming the first man to reach 2000 World Cup runs with a hat-trick of boundaries in the fifth over</m8>, and <m9>Virender Sehwag backing that with three more fours in the sixth</m9>. The flurry of hitting had the Delhi crowd buzzing, and <m10>when Sehwag carved Seelaar over extra cover for six and then dabbed him to third man for four, India were 69/0 in the eighth over</m10> and Netherlands looked set for a hiding. #p#Seelaar, though, ensured it wasn't another embarrassingly one-sided match, like many of those involving the Associates in this tournament. <m11>He had Sehwag slicing to point</m11>, and <m12>then dismissed both Tendulkar and the promoted power-hitter Yusuf Pathan in the 10th over to rein in India</m12>. #p#<m13>Virat Kohli didn't last too long before being bowled by Peter Borren</m13>, but <m14>Gautam Gambhir and Yuvraj Singh steadied the innings</m14> as Netherlands' limited bowling struggled to make more inroads. <m15>They added 40 trouble-free runs</m15> before <m16>Gambhir was bowled round his legs</m16>. <m17>It was left to Yuvraj and MS Dhoni</m17>, India's finishers over the past few years, to calmly <m18>steer India to victory</m18> with <m19>a 61-run stand</m19>, with <m20>Yuvraj getting his third half-century</m20> in a row. #p#India would have had a tougher test had it not been for a Netherlands middle-order collapse, which was sandwiched by a solid start and a flourish at the end. On choosing to bat, <m21>Eric Szwarczynski, playing his first match of the tournament, combined well with Wesley Barresi to put on 56</m21>, equalling Netherlands' best opening partnership in World Cups. <m22>There were only six boundaries in the first two Powerplays</m22> but aside from a couple of half-chances, it was easy going for Netherlands. #p#Smart stats. Sachin Tendulkar became the first batsman to score 2000 runs in World Cups. He has scored 432 more runs than Ricky Ponting, who is in second place with 1577. <m23>Yuvraj Singh's unbeaten 51</m23> was his third successive 50-plus score in ODIs, a feat he has achieved for the second time in his career. He had done this earlier in November 2007. <m24>India won with 81 balls to spare</m24>, which is their fifth-best in terms of balls remaining, in a World Cup match. <m25>The 56-run stand between Wesley Barresi and Eric Szwarczynski</m25> equalled Netherlands' highest for the first wicket in World Cup matches. The only other instance when they achieved this was in 1996, against South Africa. <m26>Pieter Seelaar took three wickets</m26> in an innings for the second time in this World Cup - he had taken three in Netherlands' match against West Indies. Both India and Netherlands have got only one review right out of seven in the World Cup so far. In today's match, neither team got one right, though <m27>Netherlands tried twice</m27> and <m28>India once</m28>. #p#<m29>Piyush Chawla, surprisingly retained after a horror match against Ireland, finally got the breakthrough in the 16th over with his favourite weapon, the googly, which bowled Szwarczynski after he read it too late.</m29> <m30>The next dismissal came from the most impressive bowler in the Ireland game, Yuvraj, whose wicket-to-wicket bowling got Barresi lbw.</m30> #p#<m31>Tom Cooper and Ryan ten Doeschate, two batsmen with career averages in the mid-60s, thwarted India for 10 overs</m31>, <m32>surviving two tough caught-and-bowled chances</m32> but dispatching the odd loose ball served up to put on 35. <m33>Netherlands were 99 for 2</m33> after 29, not quite top gear, but the platform was in place for some big hits later on. It wasn't to be though, as <m34>both batsmen were dismissed in successive overs</m34> to spark <m35>a collapse that cost them 5 for 28</m35>. #p#Bas Zuiderent had alerted the world to his talent with a half-century against England in 1996, but of the 16 innings he has played in World Cups since, 12 have been single-digit efforts. <m36>Today was another failure for the experienced batsman, done in by Zaheer's swing</m36>. #p#<m37>There were a couple of avoidable run-outs as well</m37>, but <m38>the dismissal that was most embarrassing for Netherlands was Alexei Kervesee's; he swiped a long hop from Chawla, expertly picking out Harbhajan Singh at deep midwicket.</m38> #p#The Netherlands captain, Peter Borren, had spoken of playing brave cricket before this game, and <m39>it was his adventurous hitting</m39> that <m40>lifted his side towards 200</m40>. <m41>He warmed up by lashing Yuvraj for a couple of powerful fours in the 42nd over</m41>, before taking <m42>the batting Powerplay</m42> and <m43>damaging Chawla's figures with a couple of muscular hits over long-on</m43>. <m44>Mudassar Bukhari joined the fun, swinging two sixes over the leg side</m44> before <m45>both he and Borren were dismissed by Zaheer in the same over to wrap up the innings</m45>. #p#<m46>The win</m46> puts India top of the table, but they are through with their easy outings in the tournament, with only South Africa and West Indies remaining in the league phase before the knockouts. #p#Match Timeline

AFP Enlarge Related Links Matches: India v Netherlands at Delhi Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: India | Netherlands #p#Slip of the day #p#Just the ball before <m2>he trapped Wesley Barresi plumb in front</m2>, <m3>Yuvraj Singh had his butter-fingers moment (which would have made Netherlands' shirt sponsors Amul guffaw). Funnily enough, he had gone through his bowling action but instead of the ball pitching in front, it lobbed out of his hands in the reverse direction and almost took umpire Steve Davis' head off. Both men could only laugh at the freakish incident.</m3> #p#Tendulkar moment of the day #p#<m4>Ryan ten Doeschate lined up to bowl his first ball</m4>. Facing him was Sachin Tendulkar. <m5>The Dutchman immediately pushed the short fine leg, which was square originally, finer. Tendulkar glanced at the change and ten Doeschate pitched fuller. The ball seamed in towards Tendulkar's legs. The aim was to trap him in front of the wicket. But Tendulkar had smartly moved in slightly and flicked the ball delicately, exactly past the point where the fielder was originally standing.</m5> Ahem. #p#Shots of the day #p#<m6>In ten Doeschate's second over, Tendulkar skipped a step and then two steps forward to cream him in front of square.</m6> Even Yashpal Sharma, one of the Indian selectors, was so impressed at the master's technique, that he started shadow-playing the straight arc of the bat that only Tendulkar draws while playing his stroke. #p#Flop of the day #p#All the buzz around Netherlands coming in to the game was to do with ten Doeschate, the only Associate player with an IPL contract; the only big fella among the little guys; the only one in a team of Bas Zuiderents and Peter Borrens worth watching. When he came to the wicket at <m7>70 for 2</m7>, opportunity and the big stage called out his name. Less than half an hour into a brief, unremarkable innings, <m8>ten Doeschate was lulled by one of Yuvraj's lollies, which dipped on him. His expansive strike down the ground carried only as far as Zaheer Khan on the long-off fence.</m8> <m9>When he bowled later in the evening, he was munched for 23 runs in his first two overs.</m9> #p#Invisible men of the day #p#Who would have thought guys called Szwarczynski and Barresi could be anyone other than deep defenders for a 1990ish AC Milan? Who could foresee that at this World Cup, Szwarczynski and Barresi would belong to a tribe that includes the pairs of Watson and Haddin, Pietersen and Strauss, Sehwag and Tendulkar, and Tharanga and Dilshan? <m10>Netherlands openers Eric Szwarczynski and Wesley Barresi, both South African born, put together 56 in 15 overs.</m10> When they crossed 50, like Cold War spies exchanging briefcases, they met each other at the centre of the wicket, quietly tapped gloves, nodded and went back to their ends. No one noticed; no one applauded. #p#Mess of the day #p#<m11>Virat Kohli steered a Peter Borren delivery towards an unmanned backward square leg and raced for what he thought was a possible double. His partner Gautam Gambhir seemed to have settled for a single. But at the behest of Kohli's call, Gambhir turned back and set off for the second run while Kolhi, who had taken a few strides, suddenly stopped having noticed ten Doeschate's swift charge from deep square leg. By then Gambhir was stuck halfway down the pitch. Unfortunately for Netherlands, captain Borren, standing mid-pitch failed to cleanly collect the throw, and his fumble allowed Gambhir to scamper home.</m11> Fortunately for Netherlands, <m12>Borren made quick amends in his next over, beating Kohli's defence and hitting off stump.</m12>
25	505080	India v Netherlands, Group B, World Cup 2011, Delhi	A wasted opportunity for Netherlands	Nagraj Gollapudi at the Feroz Shah Kotla	March 9, 2011	#p#Even Netherlands will wonder how they could have been so good while defending and so terrible while batting. The contrast between their attitude and play in the afternoon and evening was black and white. If they defended a small total sturdily, a complete meekness had enveloped their batsmen while setting up the target. All the pre-match talk of being brave got lost in the Delhi smog. In the end, Netherlands were left rubbing their eyes. #p#Yet there was more clarity when it all began. As soon as Peter Borren called heads and opted to bat, it seemed Netherlands had a plan. There must have been a target too (Borren said in the end they fell short by 60 runs). But in the middle, Netherlands lacked direction, grew confused by the minute, and in the end even a late fightback from Borren was not enough to mount a challenging total. #p#All three batsmen in the top order got starts but none progressed to take charge. <m1>There was a new opening pair in Eric Szwarczynski, who was playing his first match of the tournament, and Wesley Barresi</m1> after the original pair of Alexei Kervezee and Barresi had failed to raise a platform in the previous three matches. <m2>The Szwarczynski-Barresi combination</m2> showed intent and character to survive the initial spell from Zaheer Khan and India's spinners, who were brought in immediately. Playing with utmost caution <m3>the pair had raised 58 runs in the first 15 overs.</m3> It was not an embarrassing thing, as even teams like South Africa had made slow starts on the same ground during the tournament. The key was to steadily multiply the gains from then on. #p#That is when the inexperience kicked in. <m4>Both openers perished</m4> trying to force the issue. The middle order was no better. Not one batsman showed any urgency. Not one batsman could take charge. All batsmen comfortably forgot that rotating the strike was mandatory. As a consequence, the run-rate scarcely climbed to much over three runs an over, <m5>until the 40th over after which 55 runs were scored in 6.4 overs</m5>. #p#Out of the 277 deliveries Netherlands faced, <m6>there were 181 dot balls</m6>. Eighty four of their 189 runs had been scored in <m7>boundaries and sixes</m7>. That pattern has been carried forward from their previous three matches. #p#Essentially, the inability to adjust the gears hurt Netherlands badly. Here is where Ireland are heads and shoulders above the rest of the Associates. Of course, compared to the 9-to-5 bunch that makes up Netherlands' squad, Ireland have more professionals in their ranks who ply their trade on the English county circuit; a stable support structure that supports the game helps too. #p#One big reason Ireland put up a much stiffer fight against India was because they had a definite plan. They understood very well that runs would not come easy but they found a way out by pressurising India's fielding, easily one of the worst in the tournament. Also, for Ireland, there is never only one man standing. Many hands have worked together to keep Ireland a competitive side. Of course, a freakish innings like Kevin O'Brien's definitely helps, but Ireland now enter a contest with a hope that they spark off an upset. Opponents can no more ignore them. #p#That is not saying that Netherlands don't have any of those qualities. In fact, many were evident in their first match against England. Ryan ten Doeschate cracked a magnificent century, but he had many men behind him. Later, in the field, Netherlands showed the spirit of Ireland to give England a scare. Sadly, in the next two matches, they were annihilated by South Africa and West Indies. #p#Pieter Seelaar now has Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag and Kevin Pietersen among his list of scalps. AFP Enlarge #p#Unfortunately for Netherlands, on Wednesday, <m8>their star player ten Doeschate perished to silly shot selection</m8> and <m9>later was targeted by India's opening pair of Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag, going for 23 runs in his first two overs.</m9> Netherlands showed courage, and <m10>Peter Seelaar, their young left-arm spinner, who had watched his Ireland counterpart George Dockrell bowl against India, was brave to challenge the India batsmen, and came out on top with the prize wickets of Sehwag, Tendulkar and Yusuf Pathan</m10>. #p#"We were brave to come back with the bat from where we were," Borren said after the match. "We were also brave to come back from where we were after Tendulkar and Sehwag's onslaught. It was a little bit of a rollercoaster ride really throughout the match. #p#"We started really well. We had a solid foundation. We lost our way pretty much completely in the middle of the innings but managed to make up a few runs at the backend of <m11>the (batting) Powerplay</m11>. Then, <m12>when India came out, Tendulkar and Sehwag got off to a flier</m12>. <m13>We dragged them back to 99 for 4</m13> at which stage we backed ourselves of having a good chance. But <m14>Yuvraj [Singh] and [MS] Dhoni batted really well</m14>." #p#Borren said at no point were his side overwhelmed, even <m15>when India were in a delicate position at 99 for 4.</m15> "I don't think we were overwhelmed by <m16>the occasion at 99 for 4</m16>. We did not lose our discipline. We lacked the firepower if anything. I am very proud of the way we came back <m17>after they were something like 65 for none</m17> after probably... one over," he said, managing to keep his wit intact despite his team's fourth straight loss in the tournament. #p#Sitting next to him, Seelaar was all smiles when asked to pick his favourite dismissal. "Tendulkar, mate. Who else?" he burst out laughing. "It is very good to get their wickets. Usually I don't bowl to that calibre of players. I thrive on it. It gets the best out of you." Seelaar can add the three scalps to a list which includes Kevin Pietersen. #p#But Netherlands need more performances like Seelaar's in order to scratch off wasted opportunities like today.
25	505083	India v Netherlands, Group B, World Cup 2011, Delhi	India and Harbhajan on loop	Sharda Ugra at the Feroz Shah Kotla	March 9, 2011	<m1>Harbhajan Singh went wicketless</m1> for the second straight game, against Netherlands in Delhi. Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Analysis : Dhoni's spin on spinners is a googly. Audio/Video: MS Dhoni: <m2>It's not a bad win</m2>. Players/Officials: MS Dhoni | Harbhajan Singh Matches: India v Netherlands at Delhi Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: India #p#The day before India staggered like drunken dukes to <m3>a five-wicket win against Netherlands</m3>, MS Dhoni talked about preparing for games like this. It was not about handling the expectations of <m4>victory</m4>, he had said, or a dominant performance, but how to "get the most" out of the matches, "particularly in departments where you want to see the most improvement." #p#By the conventional definition, "improvement" would imply a certain progression, visible perhaps or even numerical. India's most obvious progression after the Feroz Shah Kotla game is of course to edge towards the certainty of a knockout spot. On the field though, India are not on some lovely upward curve; or even striding around sure-footed on a sturdy plateau. At the moment, India's World Cup campaign looks like security camera footage caught in a loop. #p#In two matches versus the weakest teams in their group, India have chased 207 and 189, and made unnecessarily hard work of both targets. Against Ireland, Zaheer Khan led the quick men and Yuvraj Singh the spinners. Against Netherlands, not as competitive as Ireland, ditto. Chasing 207 in Bangalore on Sunday, India were 100 for 4. With a target of 189 in Delhi, the scoreline was <m5>99 for 4 versus Netherlands</m5>. #p#Oh, grumble, grumble, grumble. What's all the fuss about? At the end weren't both games won? At the end, wasn't Yuvraj still standing? Indeed but along with India's result-oriented World Cup so far - wins over Bangladesh, Ireland, Netherlands, tie with England - is another piece of patch on loop which turned up again today. #p#India's No. 1 spinner <m6>Harbhajan Singh was again tidy, compact, disciplined; and again wicketless.</m6> On a slow, low, wicket where his spinning partners Piyush Chawla and Yuvraj were extracting something off the track to at least turn batsmen's heads, Harbhajan tried it all - over and round the wicket, slower and quicker, flat and sometimes even slightly loopy - and still there were no wickets to be had; against Netherlands, far from the best players of spin even on their continent. #p#After toiling through his spell for no reward, <m7>Harbhajan stood near the midwicket fence and watched Alex Kervezee turn a Chawla turkey into a catch that came into his hands like a heat-seeking drone.</m7> Had he flung the ball onto the field and thrown a fit, the world would have understood. #p#Yet empathy plays no part in the taking of wickets. In the last 12 months, Harbhajan has played only 12 ODIs, missing out on the 5-0 buffet that was a series against New Zealand, who may not be so generous should the two teams meet up in the knockout stages. From those 12 games, Harbhajan has nine wickets with an economy rate of 4.30, but an average and strike rate that has gone through the floor of his career figures. #p#At the World Cup so far, it's two scalps in four games, with an economy rate of 4.07. Were his role just to contain, in this age of heavy bats, small grounds and Twenty20 attitudes, the economy rate could be something he could boast about. For a strike bowler not to be striking, though, is an indication that something is blunted. #p#Dhoni believes it is nothing but the occasion that caused Harbhajan's lack of success: a big event in which the little boys are trying to ward off one of India's main men. "If the opposition team is just happy to block Harbhajan Singh out, it will be tough for him to get wickets," Dhoni said. "They have to score runs off other bowlers and maybe that is why they are going after Yuvraj and he is getting wickets. We have to hunt in packs, and as long as we win, that is okay." #p#Harbhajan is one of two leaders of India's bowling pack, and his captain now expects him to react to the increasing demands of this World Cup. It is where most of India's hopes seem to rest now. Rather than a case of Harbhajan suffering from the yips after months of trying to control the run-flow, it is the turgid response of the smaller fries that has worked against the wicket-taker Harbhajan who Dhoni promises is lurking. #p#According to Dhoni, Harbhajan will step up to the plate, but only when it became slightly hotter. "Well Harbhajan reacts to aggressive cricket in a different way. If the opposition are not playing aggressive cricket, he also lays down. It won't be the case as soon as we are playing against some of the bigger sides who will look to go after him." #p#The better the opposition, Dhoni believes, the better Harbhajan will be. "As the tournament heats up you will see a different Harbhajan Singh; when we are playing against better opposition, you will see the best of Harbhajan Singh." #p#It must then logically follow that the fields also set for the soon-to-be-reinvigorated Harbhajan will also be of a higher, aggressive quality. Dhoni offered a rather strange explanation for the fields he has set for Harbhajan so far. "At the group stages, I don't want to have a forward short leg or silly point because I don't want any player to get injured. That is one of the reasons we have been restricted to using a leg slip." #p#These are all temptingly convincing explanations and one that a captain must offer to stand by his men. Dhoni's best bet is to hope that his predictions about his team's standout performances coming at standout moments will be spot on. It will then get the Indian loop unstuck and get things moving.
25	505136			Mohit Sardana		Choice of game. I have had the irrational feeling for some time that 2011 would be India and Sachin Tendulkar's year to win the World Cup. Sachin has often been quoted as saying that he would give up all his records for the World Cup. The day he made his ODI double-century, the feeling that it was all coming together overtook me and I decided to follow India for all their matches of the World Cup. So even though India v Netherlands would probably not feature on the list of marquee matches for this edition of the World Cup, it is a part of that journey of hope. #p# Team supported. I was reasonably sure of an Indian victory but was hoping the Indian bowlers would gain some confidence and form for the matches against South Africa and West Indies by rolling Netherlands for a small total on the low, slow Kotla wicket. They did manage that, only for the batting to then stutter after a brilliant start. #p# World Cup prediction. Midway through the tournament I don't think there are any clear favorites. Australia and India are the only unbeaten sides so far, but I would be surprised if either finishes the group stages unbeaten. This will be a close and competitive World Cup and any of the top five or six teams is in with a shot, given the format. Hopefully India will peak at the right time and emerge victorious, driven by the fanatical home support. #p# Key performer. Yuvraj Singh played the key role by first helping restrict Netherlands to a modest total and then shepherding the chase when the batsmen stumbled. However, it was Pieter Seelaar who gave India something to think about with his accurate left-arm spin, and converted a potential rout into a contest. #p# One thing I'd have changed. India's opponents. With due respect to Netherlands, the big-game tension was missing throughout, and even <m1>when India were 100 for 4</m1> there were no serious jitters in the crowd. The same match against a Test-playing nation would have led to a lot of nail-biting and tense moments during the chase. #p# Face-off you relished. The Netherlands innings was going as per script from an Indian point of view, with the Indian spinners forcing the batsmen into play rash shots and the pacers returning with the old ball to mop up the tail, <m2>when suddenly out of nowhere Peter Borren and Mudassar Bukhari cut loose</m2>. They were well cheered during <m3>the batting Powerplay</m3>. #p# Wow moment. <m4>The opening partnership between Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag</m4> turned the match into a Punjabi wedding, with the crowd dancing to bhangra after each hit to the fence. Both batsmen were dealing in boundaries, each of which was a wow moment in itself. #p# Close encounter. Ashish Nehra spent a few overs fielding in front of us at the square-leg boundary and was mercilessly heckled, despite Kotla being his home ground. Chants of "dheela, dheela" (roughly translated as "slowpoke") followed his every fielding effort, and he was not spared even when he returned to the boundary after <m5>a wicket-taking over</m5>. #p# Shot of the day. My favorite shot of the day, played during <m6>India's opening stand</m6>, was a non-scoring one. <m7>After opening his account with a flicked boundary to leg</m7>, <m8>Tendulkar punched an on-drive in the second over. The lack of pace from the bowler and the pitch enabled mid-on to make a diving stop, but everything about the stroke, from the straight bat, high elbow and minimal follow-through, was picture perfect.</m8> #p# Crowd meter. The stands were packed, and like anywhere in India the biggest cheer was reserved for Tendulkar. During the practice session even the catches he dropped were greeted with the kind of roar reserved for other batsmen reaching special milestones. <m9>Yusuf Pathan's surprising entry at No. 3</m9> elicited an almost similar roar, pointing to the growing popularity of his big hitting and his status as a gamechanger. #p# The police are not always kill-joys. The Delhi police have got a lot of negative press (sometimes justifiably so) but need to be complimented for maintaining order in the stands at the match. There is a tendency among spectators at the Kotla to stand up while the bowler is bowling, as the stands are not tiered properly. A few people standing up led to a domino effect, with spectators standing up in the rows behind them. The police personnel in our stand minimised this disturbance by supervising the crowd politely yet firmly, and ensured that the excitable ones kept to their seats. #p# Fancy-dress index. While there were a lot of painted faces and colourful wigs, the person who stood out was one dressed as Ravana (a demon in Hindu mythology) complete with the 10 heads and large moustache. #p# Banner of the day. Most of the banners were of the "Cricket in my religion, Sachin is my god" variety but the banner I found most striking simply said "We miss IPL Cheerleaders", with an illustration of a cheerleader that ensured the banner had no chance of ending up on prime-time television. #p# ODIs v Twenty20. The choice between ODIs and Twenty20 for me depends upon the context of the match. In spite of the popularity of Twenty20, the ODI World Cup will continue to remain the premier multi-nation tournament. #p# Overall. Except for <m10>India's opening-wicket partnership</m10> and the brief period when India were losing wickets, the cricket on display was mediocre. This was reflected in the atmosphere, especially during the Netherlands innings, when the crowd only came to life during <m11>Borren and Bukhari's entertaining stand</m11>. #p# Marks out of 10. 6. Overall it was some confidence gained for the Indian bowlers, and two points in the bag.
26	505023	Sri Lanka v Zimbabwe, Group A, World Cup 2011, Pallekele	Chigumbura urges top order to deliver	Osman Samiuddin in Pallekele	March 9, 2011	#p#Elton Chigumbura has urged his top order to start delivering as his side look ahead to the daunting task of taking on co-hosts Sri Lanka in Pallekele on Thursday. Zimbabwe have a solitary win from three games - against Canada - to show for their efforts in the tournament so far, and they have been outplayed by both Australia and New Zealand. #p#But captain Chigumbura believes if they can get through the first 15 overs unscathed, his side stands a chance. Zimbabwe stuttered to 57 for 4 in 15 against Australia, 46 for 5 against New Zealand and 73 for 2 against Canada. #p#"We've been working on keeping our wickets in the first 15 overs, which we haven't done," Chigumbura said. "Our top order has been working on keeping their wickets in hand and to build their innings. Hopefully we do that tomorrow and if we do I am sure we can have a good game." #p#Zimbabwe have struggled against the pace of Australia and New Zealand, but Sri Lanka bring an entirely different examination with bowlers such as Lasith Malinga, Ajantha Mendis and Muttiah Muralitharan. "It is a big challenge," Chigumbura said. "Most of their bowlers are matchwinners. #p#"We've been watching them play against other teams. If we keep our wickets in hand, I'm sure we can handle them a bit better. But if we lose wickets first up then it's going to be hard for us to come back in the game." #p#Elton Chigumbura said Zimbabwe's top order needed to keep wickets in hand if they had a chance of competing against Sri Lanka in Pallekele AFP Enlarge #p#Zimbabwe's own strength has been spin and the reliance on it has been heavy. Of the 125.4 overs bowled by the side in three games, a staggering 101.1 - or over 80% - have been bowled by a variety of spinners. Thirteen of the 15 wickets taken by bowlers have been by spinners, Ray Price, who has opened the bowling during the tournament, and Grame Cremer leading the way with four each. #p#But the surface at the Pallekele International Cricket Stadium on which New Zealand and Pakistan played on Tuesday helped faster bowlers and wasn't as responsive to spin as might have been expected. #p#That might, said Chigumbura, force a tinkering of their strategy, but only a tinkering. "I saw the game yesterday and it was assisting seamers and not spinning a lot. I think it will remain the same. #p#"My spinners are more consistent. They are not big turners of the ball so it's not going to really affect them. It's just a matter of bowling a good line and length and they have been doing it for a long time. There might be one or two seamers, and we might try to make use of them. But after that we will mainly use our spinners." #p#Ireland's win over England over in Group B has pumped hope into the heart of all weaker teams and Chigumbura said the chance of an upset comes down to a question of belief. "Ireland always believed and so do we, obviously, but there might be room to improve. It is down to how much you want it. If you believe you can beat a bigger team, it's up to every individual to have that same belief. #p#"It gives me motivation when you see other teams who don't give up and end up winning. That teaches you it isn't over until it's over. If we correct our batting I always back my bowlers to defend any score of more than 260, and we're working on our batting."
26	505038	Sri Lanka v Zimbabwe, World Cup 2011, Group A, Pallekele	Sri Lanka aim to build momentum	The Preview by Andrew McGlashan	March 9, 2011	#p#Match Facts March 10, Pallekele Start time 2.30pm (0900 GMT) #p#Zimbabwe need more from their top order to stand a chance against Sri Lanka Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: Elton Chigumbura | Dilhara Fernando | Ajantha Mendis Matches: Sri Lanka v Zimbabwe at Pallekele Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Sri Lanka | Zimbabwe #p#The Big Picture #p#Like all four major Test nations in Group A, Sri Lanka are on course to progress to the quarter-finals without any serious problems, and the chances of Zimbabwe providing an upset to create a modicum of the excitement witnessed in the other group is slim to none. However, for Sri Lanka it's an ideal time to produce a commanding all-round performance and build momentum ahead of the quarter-finals. #p#There is a feeling that Sri Lanka haven't quite clicked yet. They have eased past Canada and Kenya - the latter thanks to Lasith Malinga's hat-trick - but came unstuck against Pakistan with an 11-run defeat. The clash against Australia was shaping up to be a cracker when the rain came and interrupted a well-paced innings by Kumar Sangakkara and denied the spinners their chance to shine. #p#Zimbabwe shouldn't provide many problems having suffered a 10-wicket hammering at the hands of New Zealand in their last game. Their batting has lacked consistency and will face a tough examination from whichever combination of spinners Sri Lanka opt to field, while there's Malinga's toe-crushes to overcome as well. Ray Price and Prosper Utseya are good spinners themselves but desperately need the batsmen to back them up. #p#Form guide (completed matches, most recent first) Sri Lanka WLWWW Zimbabwe LWLLL #p#Watch out for... #p#Ajantha Mendis may have been worked out by some of the top international teams, but against lower-ranked opponents his unique variety of wrist and finger spin still proves a handful. He surprisingly went wicketless against Kenya, did not play against Pakistan and took just one wicket against Canada. He'll hope for a chance to make his mark on the World Cup and build confidence ahead of the knockout stages, but faces competition for his place from left-arm spinner Rangana Herath. #p#Elton Chigumbura needs to lead from the front. The captain has struggled so far with three low scores and it means Zimbabwe's middle order is lacking someone to either rebuild after early problems or increase the scoring rate later on. Chigumbura has the talent to be a major run-scorer which is why his lean World Cup is such a frustration, and perhaps the stresses of captaincy are weighing on his shoulders. Conditions haven't proved conducive to his medium-pace, either, which makes it even more important that he delivers with the bat. #p#Team news #p#If Sri Lanka want three spinners in their XI again it means the new ball is either in the hands of one of them or Angelo Mathews. With Malinga also more of a threat with the older ball it can leave Sri Lanka a little light early on so it may be an opportunity to assess the balance of their team. Mahela Jayawardene hinted that Dilhara Fernando could earn his first outing although Nuwan Kulasekara provides more batting. #p#Sri Lanka (possible) 1 Tillakaratne Dilshan, 2 Upul Tharanga, 3 Kumar Sangakkara (wk) 4 Mahela Jayawardene, 5 Thilan Samaraweera, 6 Chamara Silva, 7 Angelo Mathews, 8 Nuwan Kulasekara, 9 Lasith Malinga, 10 Ajantha Mendis, 11 Muttiah Muralitharan #p#There aren't really many options for Zimbabwe to strengthen their team so it's a case of asking for better from what they already have. The pitch in Pallekele offered some assistance to the seamers during Tuesday's match between New Zealand and Pakistan, and Chigumbura said they may play one or two seamers although Chris Mpofu is carrying a side strain so is doubtful. #p#Zimbabwe (probable) 1 Brendan Taylor, 2 Charles Coventry, 3 Tatenda Taibu (wk), 4 Craig Ervine, 5 Elton Chigumbura (capt), 6 Regis Chakabva, 7 Greg Lamb, 8 Prosper Utseya, 9 Graeme Cremer, 10 Ray Price, 11 Tinashe Panyangara #p#Pitch and conditions #p#Pallekelle will be staging its second ODI following the match between Pakistan and New Zealand. Ross Taylor didn't have many problems with the conditions - and comfortably cleared the ropes - but batting proved trickier under lights when the ball zipped around. #p#Stats and trivia #p#Thirteen of the 16 wickets Zimbabwe have taken at the World Cup have gone to their spinners #p#Compared to their record against some other major nations, Zimbabwe have had their moments against Sri Lanka with seven victories in 46 ODIs, with the most recent an eight-wicket win at Harare last June. #p#Quotes #p#"If we keep our wickets in hand, I'm sure we can handle them a bit better. But if we lose wickets first up then it is going to be hard for us to come back in the game." Elton Chigumbura says it is Zimbabwe's top order that needs most improvement #p#"It's such a big and long tournament it's important that we be consistent and try and get better and better going forward because you get big games and tough games coming in a few weeks." Mahela Jaywardene is keen to build some momentum ahead of the knockouts
26	505043	World Cup 2011	Fernando could play - Jayawardene	Sa'adi Thawfeeq in Pallekele	March 9, 2011	#p#Mahela Jayawardene has revealed Sri Lanka have not decided on their combination for Thursday's match against Zimbabwe in Pallekele, but said having several options is proving to be a 'healthy headache' for the team. #p#"We have a lot of options in the spin and pace departments. We will employ them based on the opposition and the conditions," vice-captain Jayawardene said. "Lasith [Malinga] coming back to the team has given us more options, which is great. #p#"Dilhara [Fernando] has a good chance as it's a very bouncy wicket. That's something we will take into consideration when looking at what is the best combination going forward. [Nuwan] Kulasekara and Thisara [Perera] have bowled well given the conditions and have been picking up wickets so it will be a toss-up. So many options are a healthy headache rather than a nasty one. That's not something many captains have." #p#Sri Lanka, he said, would not underestimate Zimbabwe. "They are a very good, all-round side. We've come across them quite often and they can be a surprise package. We are not taking anything lightly; we just want to concentrate on our performances and execute a game plan." #p#Sri Lanka are one of the few teams that have not been forced to replace injured players so far this World Cup, and Jayawardene said they had taken the necessary precautions before the tournament began. "In our preparation for the World Cup we did a lot of work with fitness and monitoring the workload of some of our players who have a history with certain injuries. We looked after them and at the same time we made sure they played enough cricket. #p#"Lasith [Malinga] had an issue in the first few games, so we made sure that he is rested properly before he got back into things. But we can't control injuries so there is no point worrying about it. If someone is injured, there will be somebody to put their hands up and perform. Fortunately most of our guys are doing well." #p#Sri Lanka have had two easy victories over the Associates so far, but slipped up against Pakistan and were stopped by the rain from competing against Australia. Jayawardene said the team had not peaked yet, but the length of the tournament meant improving along the way was the key. "We have been consistent but still there is room for improvement. It's such a long tournament, it's important that we be consistent and try and get better going forward, because there are big, tough games coming up in a few weeks. The batting we can improve in terms of getting guys to bat long periods and making sure we have big partnerships."
26	505092		'Solidity of middle order has helped me and Kumar'	Mahela Jayawardene	March 10, 2011	'Chamara Silva's form is vital to Sri Lanka's chances' AFP Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: Mahela Jayawardene | Chamara Silva Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Sri Lanka #p#It's been an exciting World Cup so far. At the beginning when people asked me to name the favourites, I had told them there is no clear favourite. And now we know why! Any of the top teams can win this. There have been surprises like Ireland beating England ; we always knew there will be one or two games like that. Netherlands played couple of good games. But because of the format we knew that if the big teams play some good cricket, they will get through. #p#We played Australia last and took a lot of positives out of that game. They are a strong and competitive side and to have the game under control at the point when the rains came down was a good thing. Weather is not under our control and so there is no point worrying about it; we got a point from it and we need to concentrate on the next game. #p#We have told the youngsters to take one game at a time, not worry about what's gone and just enjoy the World Cup. We normally take a couple of days off after playing a game and regroup for the next. We try to give small goals to the players which help them a lot. #p#There have been some murmurs about our openers' form. Both have been hitting the ball well and gave us a good start in couple of games. They didn't provide us with a good one against Australia but such things are always going to happen. The only thing we want from them is to spend more time in the middle and bat longer; the runs will come automatically. #p#I am confident about the way I am batting. I started off with a hundred, didn't bat against Kenya, got a very good ball from Shoaib Akhtar and was batting well against Australia when that run-out happened. I have to make sure I make a difference in the big games. #p#The solidity of the middle order has helped me and Kumar Sangakkara bat freely at the top of the order. Thilan Samaraweera is a perfect fit at No.5 and he has a burning desire to excel at that position. He calms the nerves and settles the middle order with his solidity. #p#Chamara Silva comes next and we are happy to have him in the groove. His sister passed away at the beginning of the tournament and he had to go away. When he came back, we asked him how he was feeling and started to slowly ease him back into play. The first game he played was a tough one, against Pakistan, and though he started slowly, he started looking good by the end. His form is vital to our chances. He has loads of experience and had a great last World Cup. If he can continue batting well, it will give more freedom to Kumar and other batsmen batting higher up. We are happy to have him back in the team. The batting line-up looks good with Thilan, Silva and Angelo Mathews batting in the lower middle-order. #p#We went with a spin-heavy attack in the last game against Australia but it all depends on the conditions and the opposition. We are lucky to have bowlers with different skills, in spin and pace, and we can mix and match according to our strategy. Nuwan Kulasekara, who missed the game against Australia, is a fine, shrewd bowler who will play a big part in our campaign. It was just in that game, on that pitch, we felt it would be better to play an extra spinner. #p#We play Zimbabwe next; they are a good side and we can't be complacent. We have to remain positive and execute our plans.

AFP Enlarge Related Links News : We will peak from next game - Dilshan. Matches: Sri Lanka v Zimbabwe at Pallekele Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Sri Lanka | Zimbabwe #p#When Elton Chigumbura chose to bowl in Pallekele, to avoid his spinners having to struggle with a dew-soaked ball, little did he think his team would fail to take a wicket for 44.3 overs. But <m9>Tillakaratne Dilshan and Upul Tharanga batted forever, notching up the first double-century opening partnership in World Cup history</m9>, and <m10>their hundreds</m10> set up <m11>Sri Lanka's victory</m11>, officially securing their place in the quarter-finals. #p#<m12>The result</m12> was a foregone conclusion once <m13>Sri Lanka scored 327</m13> but there was a flutter of hope in the Zimbabwe camp <m14>when Brendan Taylor was at the forefront of the pursuit. He combined orthodoxy and innovation during an aggressive half-century</m14>, taking advantage of a wayward Sri Lankan pace attack. The hosts gathered themselves, though, and struck twice at the other end after a century opening stand. <m15>Taylor eventually departed for 80 in the 25th over</m15>, and with him ended Zimbabwe's improbable chances. #p#The struggle of Zimbabwe's batsmen was in contrast to the ease with which <m16>Dilshan and Tharanga had entertained a packed house. They started at top speed, taking 84 of the first 11 overs by playing a shot a minute, and then shifted to a lower gear, bleeding Zimbabwe steadily and so easily through the middle overs. There were regular bursts of acceleration later in the innings and a concerted push during the final ten overs.</m16> At no stage were they bothered and rarely has a bowling performance looked so toothless - <m17>Chris Mpofu's shout after striking Tharanga's pad with the first ball of the game was the only appeal against the openers.</m17> <m18>Tired shots, rather than incisive bowling, brought about the dismissal of Tharanga</m18> <m19>and then Dilshan</m19>, and more middle-order wickets fell as batsmen came, swung and pushed the total beyond 300. #p#Smart Stats. <m20>The 282-run opening partnership between Tillakaratne Dilshan and Upul Tharanga is the highest opening stand in World Cups</m20> going past the 194-run stand between Saeed Anwar and Wajahatullah Wasti in the 1999 semi-final. Tharanga has been involved in five 200-plus stands in ODIs. <m21>The record opening stand</m21> is also the second-highest stand for the opening wicket in ODIs only behind the 286 stand between Sanath Jayasuriya and Tharanga against England. It is also the fourth-highest partnership for any wicket in ODIs and the second highest in World Cups. <m22>Sri Lanka's 327</m22> is their third-highest total in a World Cup game and their tenth best in ODIs. It is also their highest total against Zimbabwe in ODIs. <m23>The 116-run stand between Brendan Taylor and Regis Chakabva is the highest opening stand for Zimbabwe against Sri Lanka</m23> in ODIs and their fifth-highest for any wicket in World Cups. Dilshan became only the second player after Feiko Kloppenburg of Netherlands <m24>to score a century</m24> and <m25>take four wickets</m25> in a World Cup game. Overall, in ODIs, Dilshan is the 11th player to achieve the feat. It is also <m26>Dilshan's first century</m26> in World Cups. <m27>The 139-run margin is Sri Lanka's fifth-largest victory margin</m27> in World Cups and the largest against Zimbabwe in World Cup games. The 398 runs aggregated by both opening pairs is the highest in an ODI surpassing the 368 runs aggregated in the match between Sri Lanka and England in 2006. <m28>Dilshan's figures of 4 for 4</m28> is the best bowling by a Sri Lankan spinner in World Cups and the tenth-best overall for a spinner in World Cup games. This was the first time in World Cups and the 22nd time overall in ODIs that both openers scored centuries in an innings. #p#<m29>Tharanga threaded the fourth ball through point with a square drive and Sri Lanka were away</m29>. For the first time in the tournament Chigumbura did not use Ray Price with the brand new ball and gave <m30>the second over to Tinashe Panyangara</m30>. <m31>It was a costly decision as Dilshan ran amok, driving the full balls, and cutting and pulling the short ones to take 18 runs off the over.</m31> #p#There was no let-up in Sri Lanka's pace during <m32>the mandatory Powerplay, off which they scored 77</m32>. <m33>Dilshan and Tharanga slashed through point, pulled through square and then drove when the length was too full, punishing everyone who bowled at them.</m33> <m34>When Price was brought on in the fifth over, Dilshan skipped down and drove him inside out through cover.</m34> #p#<m35>Not until the 12th and 13th over was there spin from both ends and then Price bowled the innings' first maiden.</m35> The spin trio of Price, Prosper Utseya and Graeme Cremer began to exercise more control over the run-rate, <m36>which dipped below six for the first time in the 19th</m36>, but they failed to take a wicket. Tharanga and Dilshan seamlessly shifted to a lower gear and focused on accumulation. #p#Zimbabwe's spinners had conceded only 76 runs off 17 overs when Chigumbura gave pace another run by bringing himself on. <m37>Dilshan slapped a wide offering through cover to move to 99</m37> and <m38>then reached his century off 95 balls</m38>, his first in World Cups. <m39>Panyangara returned and Tharanga immediately lofted over mid-off and pulled past fine leg.</m39> <m40>Sri Lanka took 30 off overs 31-33</m40>. #p#<m41>Tharanga and Dilshan broke Saeed Anwar and Wajahatullah Wasti's World Cup record</m41> of 194 for the first wicket and then became the first openers to score hundreds in the same World Cup innings. <m42>They reached 200 in 33.4 overs</m42>. During <m43>the batting Powerplay, taken in the 41st over</m43>, Tharanga's inside-out play through cover was exquisite. With the highest opening partnership in ODIs - 286 between Sanath Jayasuriya and Tharanga at Headingley 2006 - within striking distance, <m44>Tharanga holed out to deep cover, bringing Zimbabwe some relief</m44>. <m45>Dilshan followed in the next over, leaving the finishing touches to his well-rested team-mates.</m45> #p#As impressive as Sri Lanka's display was, Taylor played some of the best shots of the game. <m46>Using Malinga's pace, Taylor flicked a low full toss to the backward square-leg boundary</m46>, <m47>pushed a wide one through covers</m47> and <m48>chipped a short one over Kumar Sangakkara's head</m48>. There was only touch and timing in those shots, no power. <m49>Taylor got to his fifty off 39 balls and carried on batting aggressively.</m49> #p#<m50>Muttiah Muralitharan came on only in the 16th over</m50>, after <m51>the bowling Powerplay</m51> was completed, and <m52>in the 20th he spun a doosra on to Regis Chakabva's off stump, ending the opening stand on 116</m52>. Tatenda Taibu was bent on reverse-sweeping Murali whenever he could, and got away with it. <m53>He didn't get away with edging Angelo Mathew though, and Sangakkara dived to his right to take the catch inches off the ground.</m53> #p#<m54>Those two wickets</m54> set back Zimbabwe's chase considerably, and <m55>Taylor's dismissal</m55> was the definitive blow. <m56>On 80, he chipped a slower ball from Angelo Mathews straight to midwicket</m56> and the contest was over. <m57>Dilshan returned to torment Zimbabwe, picking up four batsmen - his finishing touches on a terrific game.</m57> <m58>And Murali, playing his final ODI in front of his home crowd, took the final wicket.</m58> #p#Match Timeline

Associated Press Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: Brendan Taylor Matches: Sri Lanka v Zimbabwe at Pallekele Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Sri Lanka | Zimbabwe #p#The non-opening Zimbabwe had opened the bowling with Ray Price's left-arm spin in every match of the tournament thus far. Captain Elton Chigumbura said before the match he felt the surface may aid seam bowlers and so today he opened with seamers Chris Mpofu and Tinashe Panyangara. <m2>Mpofu's first wasn't bad</m2> but <m3>Tillekaratne Dilshan smacked 18 off Panyangara's first</m3> and the tone was immediately set. As ever, <m4>Price came on soon enough and turned out to be the best bowler of the day, going for 46 in nine</m4>, with <m5>the innings' only maiden</m5>. #p#The dry Spell. <m6>Until Upul Tharanga skied Mpofu to cover</m6>, Zimbabwe had bowled 78.1 overs across two games - including the ten-wicket loss to New Zealand - without taking a single wicket. They then proceeded to <m7>take 6 for 26 in 20 balls</m7>, to make up for lost time. <m8>Mpofu took three in one over alone</m8>. #p#The upar cut/fly-scoop/perpendicular cut. Even ESPNcricinfo's not quite sure what to make of Brendan Taylor's 'shot'. When he first unveiled it against New Zealand it seemed an instinctive fluke and we called it the fly-scoop. Out it came today, <m9>in the fifth over against Lasith Malinga no less. The bouncer was around off-stump this time, but back Taylor leant, waited, and bunted it over the wicketkeeper as if he was putting the final dab of paint onto a masterpiece. We called it the perpendicular cut in BBB commentary but surely it most resembles Virender Sehwag's soft-drink endorsing upar cut?</m9> #p#<m10>The opener Tharanga and Dilshan may both have made hundreds and set a World Cup record</m10> but the innings of the day from an opener was Taylor's. <m11>The upar cut</m11> was a lone concession to modern-day unorthodoxy, for <m12>the 72-ball innings</m12> was built on technical purity, postcard perfect cover drives, lofts down the ground and grass-shaving sweeps off Muttiah Muralitharan. <m13>The end was tame</m13> but while it lasted it was a hand any top-flight opener would've been proud of. #p#The drop. Sri Lanka's fielding unusually touched extremes today. <m14>Lasith Malinga was generally awful, dropping Taylor on the third man boundary</m14> and letting balls slip through his hands and legs. <m15>Muralitharan dropped a sitter at long leg.</m15> <m16>In between Mahela Jayawardene plucked out a screamer at slip off Dilshan, diving to his left.</m16> <m17>But the very next ball, he just couldn't get his fingers underneath an edge from Graeme Cramer. Had he done so it would've completed Dilshan's hat-trick.</m17> #p#The atmosphere. Electric throughout as a full house swamped into the Pallekele Stadium and somehow managed to keep themselves amused through another one-sided game in the Group of Dead, Group A. Such was the demand in fact that the gates to the stadium had to be opened an hour earlier than usual in the morning to let everyone in. Give them cricket, any kind of it (involving the home side) and they will come.

AFP Enlarge Related Links News : We will peak from next game - Dilshan. Matches: Sri Lanka v Zimbabwe at Pallekele Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Sri Lanka | Zimbabwe #p#When Elton Chigumbura chose to bowl in Pallekele, to avoid his spinners having to struggle with a dew-soaked ball, little did he think his team would fail to take a wicket for 44.3 overs. But <m9>Tillakaratne Dilshan and Upul Tharanga batted forever, notching up the first double-century opening partnership in World Cup history</m9>, and <m10>their hundreds</m10> set up <m11>Sri Lanka's victory</m11>, officially securing their place in the quarter-finals. #p#<m12>The result</m12> was a foregone conclusion once <m13>Sri Lanka scored 327</m13> but there was a flutter of hope in the Zimbabwe camp <m14>when Brendan Taylor was at the forefront of the pursuit. He combined orthodoxy and innovation during an aggressive half-century</m14>, taking advantage of a wayward Sri Lankan pace attack. The hosts gathered themselves, though, and struck twice at the other end after a century opening stand. <m15>Taylor eventually departed for 80 in the 25th over</m15>, and with him ended Zimbabwe's improbable chances. #p#The struggle of Zimbabwe's batsmen was in contrast to the ease with which <m16>Dilshan and Tharanga had entertained a packed house. They started at top speed, taking 84 of the first 11 overs by playing a shot a minute, and then shifted to a lower gear, bleeding Zimbabwe steadily and so easily through the middle overs. There were regular bursts of acceleration later in the innings and a concerted push during the final ten overs.</m16> At no stage were they bothered and rarely has a bowling performance looked so toothless - <m17>Chris Mpofu's shout after striking Tharanga's pad with the first ball of the game was the only appeal against the openers.</m17> <m18>Tired shots, rather than incisive bowling, brought about the dismissal of Tharanga</m18> <m19>and then Dilshan</m19>, and more middle-order wickets fell as batsmen came, swung and pushed the total beyond 300. #p#Smart Stats. <m20>The 282-run opening partnership between Tillakaratne Dilshan and Upul Tharanga is the highest opening stand in World Cups</m20> going past the 194-run stand between Saeed Anwar and Wajahatullah Wasti in the 1999 semi-final. Tharanga has been involved in five 200-plus stands in ODIs. <m21>The record opening stand</m21> is also the second-highest stand for the opening wicket in ODIs only behind the 286 stand between Sanath Jayasuriya and Tharanga against England. It is also the fourth-highest partnership for any wicket in ODIs and the second highest in World Cups. <m22>Sri Lanka's 327</m22> is their third-highest total in a World Cup game and their tenth best in ODIs. It is also their highest total against Zimbabwe in ODIs. <m23>The 116-run stand between Brendan Taylor and Regis Chakabva is the highest opening stand for Zimbabwe against Sri Lanka</m23> in ODIs and their fifth-highest for any wicket in World Cups. Dilshan became only the second player after Feiko Kloppenburg of Netherlands <m24>to score a century</m24> and <m25>take four wickets</m25> in a World Cup game. Overall, in ODIs, Dilshan is the 11th player to achieve the feat. It is also <m26>Dilshan's first century</m26> in World Cups. <m27>The 139-run margin is Sri Lanka's fifth-largest victory margin</m27> in World Cups and the largest against Zimbabwe in World Cup games. The 398 runs aggregated by both opening pairs is the highest in an ODI surpassing the 368 runs aggregated in the match between Sri Lanka and England in 2006. <m28>Dilshan's figures of 4 for 4</m28> is the best bowling by a Sri Lankan spinner in World Cups and the tenth-best overall for a spinner in World Cup games.

26	505525	Sri Lanka v Zimbabwe, World Cup 2011, Pallekele	Chigumbura sees positives in defeat	Osman Samiuddin in Pallekele	March 10, 2011	#p#The day before this game, Elton Chigumbura couldn't stop asking for his top order, and his openers in particular, to start performing. At least seven times in a short press conference, he stressed the need for Zimbabwe to go through the first 15 overs with wickets in hand, something they had failed to do against Australia and New Zealand. #p#Chigumbura got what he wanted against Sri Lanka, probably much more than he wanted. Charles Coventry was dropped and <m1>Regis Chakabva moved up to open with Brendan Taylor. For one ball short of 20 overs, in contrasting fashion, the pair took on Sri Lanka, and even rattled them a little.</m1> Taylor especially was a sight, driving with such authority and fluidity that he looked better than the two century-making openers of the day. Chakabva held up the other end, occasionally stealing a boundary, but mostly making Taylor look even better. #p#But <m2>once the first fell</m2>, the rest crumbled into a messy heap; <m3>ten wickets for 72 in only 19 overs.</m3> It isn't much good your top-order getting runs if the rest are going to fall like that. "Chasing a bigger score is always hard," Chigumbura said. "To maintain the run-rate especially with our team was going to be difficult. But it's something we can work on. Like I said yesterday, our openers played pretty well and <m4>putting on a hundred partnership is a positive for the team</m4>. Hopefully we carry on from that and improve on those weaknesses after <m5>that first partnership</m5>." #p#<m6>For those 20 overs</m6> and <m7>the last five of Sri Lanka's innings</m7>, Zimbabwe were on some kind of level footing. But for the business ends of any game, the start and the finish, they were nowhere. The surface was probably better to bat on than the one New Zealand and Pakistan played on, but the basic lack of incisiveness in Zimbabwe's attack came through. Until <m8>Chris Mpofu dismissed a tiring, flailing Upul Tharanga in the 45th over</m8>, they had gone nearly 80 overs without a single wicket, including the ten-wicket loss to New Zealand. #p#Brendan Taylor answered his captain's call for application at the top of the order. AFP Enlarge #p#It didn't seem the kind of form - or surface - to win the toss and bowl on. "No regrets at all [on the decision to field]," Chigumbura said. The decision was made, Chigumbura said, based on the "the dew factor. With our spinners I thought it was going to be better to bowl first for our spinners to grip the ball. It was a good wicket to bat on. <m9>Dilshan and Tharanga both batted pretty well</m9> and like you saw with our batting, <m10>for the first 20 overs our opening batsmen played really well</m10>, so it was a good track to bat on. You can't really take three or four wickets first-up on that." #p#Theoretically Zimbabwe are not out of the race for the World Cup quarter-finals just yet. They will fancy their chances of beating Kenya and from the established sides in the group a schizophrenic and suddenly unsure Pakistan probably offer the widest glimpse of an upset. <m11>A 139-run defeat</m11> is as big as it seems but Chigumbura saw reasons to believe, in the attitude at least. #p#"It's a big loss but I think the approach that we took was positive," he said. "Though we were all out we were going for the score. If you wanted to play for a better score or better defeat we could've lasted 50 overs. But we were all positive going for it, so it's something we have to improve on where we went wrong today." #p#And in the bigger picture, for a side realistically aiming for a return to Test cricket sooner rather than later, experience of surfaces and conditions in India and Sri Lanka will be priceless. This was Zimbabwe's first ODI in Sri Lanka since September 2002 and the games in India their first since 2006. "Playing in these conditions your line has to be different from other continents and the way you have to bat, more straight than across. We've learnt that, but we have to apply all those things we have learnt and put it together for a good game against Pakistan."
26	505528	Sri Lanka v Zimbabwe, Group A, World Cup 2011, Pallekele	We will peak from next game - Dilshan	Sa'adi Thawfeeq in Pallekele	March 10, 2011	#p#Tillakaratne Dilshan has sent out a warning to other teams that Sri Lanka will start playing their best cricket from their game against New Zealand on March 18 onwards, and keep improving as the tournament reaches its knockout stages. Dilshan's all-round performance on Thursday - <m1>he scored a century</m1> and <m2>took four wickets</m2> - helped Sri Lanka qualify for the quarter-finals with <m3>a win over Zimbabwe</m3>, but he said it was from now on that they had to be on the top of their game. #p#"After March 18 we have to play our best cricket. We cannot afford to make mistakes with the quarter-final and semi-finals coming up," Dilshan said. "We know we have qualified but we can't take it easy for the next few matches. We have to play with 100% commitment from the New Zealand match." #p#Dilshan had gotten off to starts in three of Sri Lanka's previous four games in this World Cup, but had not kicked on to get the big score, on two occasions perishing to strokes he would not have been happy with. Against Canada in Hambantota, after reaching fifty, he hit a short and wide delivery straight to deep cover, and then against Kenya in Colombo, he seemed to be lining up for a big shot before deciding to fend a short delivery to the keeper, after making 44. #p#After those performances, <m4>Dilshan recognised the importance of him having gone on to score 144</m4> on Thursday in Pallekele. "I am really happy with my batting and bowling performance. In the first couple of matches I got the starts but I didn't capitalise and get a big one. But today [Thursday] I did that and that's why I am happy with <m5>the hundred</m5>." His innings makes him the highest scorer in the tournament so far, with 283 runs at an average of 56.60. #p#It was not just about <m6>Dilshan's batting</m6> on Thursday though. He came on to do a job with the ball, and <m7>in just three overs snapped up figures of 4 for 4</m7>, his best in one-day internationals. <m8>He was even on a hat-trick at one point</m8> and <m9>would have got it had Mahela Jayawardene held on to a tough catch from Graeme Cremer at slip.</m9> Dilshan put his success with the ball down to the fact that Sri Lanka played only one of their frontline spinners on Thursday, which meant his responsibility as a bowler increased #p#<m10>Tillakaratne Dilshan's 144</m10> in Pallekel made him the leading run-getter of the World Cup so far. AFP Enlarge #p#"We usually have two or three spinners in the line-up, but today there was only [Muttiah] Muralitharan, so I knew at some point of time I would have to bowl. I seized that chance and I hope the captain will have lots of confidence in my bowling in the future. I think I can contribute a lot with my bat as well as ball and as a wicketkeeper in this World Cup." Dilshan does also keep wickets but is not expected to unless his captain Kumar Sangakkara suffers an injury. #p#As far as <m11>missing the hat-trick was concerned</m11>, Dilshan said he was not that disappointed because <m12>Jayawardene, who dropped the catch on the hat-trick ball</m12>, <m13>had taken a stunner the previous ball</m13>. "<m14>Mahela's dropped catch</m14> can happen to anyone in the match. <m15>He created a great catch before that and made it a hat-trick ball</m15>." #p#There was another milestone mised as well: two more runs would have taken Dilshan past Aravinda de Silva's score of 145 against Kenya in 1996, giving him the highest score by a Sri Lanka batsman in World Cups. But Dilshan said he was not even aware of the statistic until after <m16>he was dismissed</m16>. #p#"It was only after I got to the dressing room that someone told me that if I had scored another one run I would have passed Aravinda's record. At that time nobody can send a message. <m17>It was the 45th over.</m17> But I am not worried about messages and I am not thinking of records. I am always playing for my team. <m18>After the 45th over I was trying to get the maximum runs for my team</m18>." #p#Although <m19>Sri Lanka won comfortably</m19>, <m20>their fielding in the first ten overs of Zimbabwe's chase</m20> was not up to the mark, and Dilshan noted the room for improvement. "At the moment we are playing really good cricket and everything is going really well for us. We can't say we are not going to make any mistakes; anybody can make mistakes sometimes while batting or on the field. We have to minimise the mistakes coming to the quarter-final and keep going for the rest of the tournament." #p#Sri Lanka's next game, against New Zealand on March 18, is not in Sri Lanka as all their other group games have been, but in Mumbai. Dilshan, though, put a positive spin on the slightly puzzling scheduling, saying playing at the Wankhede Stadium would give them an opportunity to get used to the renovated ground, where the finals of the World Cup will be held on April 2. #p#"If we qualify to play in the final, we'll play in Mumbai. It's a good opportunity to play another match there before the final. We are happy playing New Zealand in Mumbai."
27	505192	Ireland v West Indies, World Cup 2011, Group B, Mohali	Buoyant West Indies confident ahead of Ireland clash	Nagraj Gollapudi in Mohali	March 10, 2011	#p#Darren Sammy is ready for Ireland. In fact, eager could be the right word. Barely a minute had passed after William Porterfield, the Ireland captain, finished with his pre-match press briefing. The ICC spokesperson was in the middle of his announcement that Sammy was scheduled to speak half hour later. Unknown to him Sammy was already there. Unprompted, he apologised to everyone about arriving early and without any notice. A gleaming smile and a few chuckles lit up the atmosphere. #p#In the last month the West Indies have been through some rough times right from the build-up phase. Adrian Barath and Carlton Baugh picked up injuries during the warm-up stage and had to go back home. Then came a bigger shock, one that Sammy calls the turning point, when Dwayne Bravo buckled his knee against South Africa in their first match and was out of the World Cup. The agony was exacerbated by the seven-wicket loss in the same match. But in the next two matches, it seemed West Indies had bounced back with consecutive wins, against the Netherlands followed by the decimation of Bangladesh. The victory in Dhaka was the fastest result in the tournament but even before the players could plan any celebrations, angry local fans transformed themselves into party poopers and hurled stones at the West Indies team bus. It was Chris Gayle who had made the news public through at tweet and summed up the nerves best, "kiss teeth" Next morning the drama intensified when the ICC chief executive Haroon Lorgat suggested the incident was cursory. Ottis Gibson, the West Indies coach, reacted furiously once he landed in Mohali. #p#Suddenly cricket took a backseat. But today Sammy cleverly slid the attention back to the game. "Something happened there...." Sammy started with a smile, and left the sentence hanging briefly, asked if the furore following the stone-pelting in Bangladesh distracted his team. "It is behind us," he finished to sum up his thoughts on the matter. #p#Darren Sammy says West Indies are fully focussed on the task at hand Getty Images Enlarge #p#If anything the mood in the West Indies camp was buoyant. Batsmen and bowlers teased each other while going through the drills while the wise pair of Gibson and Richie Richardson kept a close watch, making sure there was a purpose and the players did not lose focus on the eve of an important clash, against one the most spirited contestants in the tournament - Ireland. The Irish have progressed fast since the last time both teams clashed in an international competition - the World Twenty20 in the Caribbean last year - in a group match which West Indies won. #p#Sammy is wary of the team that shocked England in the most thrilling clash of the World Cup so far and gave a fright to India few days later. They now are in fray for a knockout berth, similar to the West Indies. "It is a team we never take for granted," the West Indies captain said. "We have a lot of respect for them. They are a team that is improving constantly which shows their cricket is moving forward. We are definitely not taking them lightly. We have seen what they are capable of doing." #p#If he had praise for the opponent, he also showed faith in his own men. "Last two games have shown that if we execute our plans anything is possible," Sammy said. According to him the West Indies remained confident about making the quarter-finals stage because all players were thinking as one. And that bonding would keep them positive and hungry. "The one thing is we have always had a good camaraderie. The past few weeks have been kind of up and down but we have stuck together as a team. We know what we are here for. All the guys have been managing the distractions quite well. The guys are really focussed and we know we have a job at hand," Sammy said. #p#Yet, West Indies are prone to be inconsistent. In the past their batsmen have failed to bring the required intensity to the contest, making it difficult for an already thin bowling attack. It was evident in the South Africa match, where after a good start the West Indies batting went into meltdown. A match that they should've won was lost. But against the Netherlands and then Bangladesh the West Indies flourished as they played joyously and won. "Against South Africa we knew where we went wrong. We were in a good position, we created opportunities where we could've taken a grip over the game but we did not. It is important that when we play against higher-ranked teams and we are in a position where we could affect a result in our favour. It is about maximising the chances presented in the game," Sammy pointed out. #p#After Ireland, the West Indies are slotted to face England and India. Hence tomorrow's match has assumed a bigger significance. "Consistency is very important going forward. So far we have managed two wins, convincing wins and we will be riding on them. We will remember all the things we did in those games, take the positives and carry them forward to the next game," Sammy said. Already Sammy is itching to have a go.
27	505209	West Indies v Ireland, Group B, World Cup 2011, Mohali	Determined Ireland target another upset	The Preview by Siddhartha Talya	March 10, 2011	#p#Match Facts March 11, Mohali Start time 09.30 (0400 GMT) #p#Ed Joyce is yet to make an impact Associated Press Enlarge Related Links News : Buoyant West Indies confident ahead of Ireland clash Players/Officials: Ed Joyce | Kemar Roach Matches: Ireland v West Indies at Mohali Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Ireland | West Indies #p#The Big Picture #p#Their ability to compete with and challenge top teams apart, Ireland will bank on another factor ahead of a crucial clash against West Indies in Mohali on Friday. One bound to bring back sweet memories for the Irish and bitter ones for their opponents - history. What was expected to be a routine hammering for the minnows in 1969 turned out to be a shocking win as Ireland shot out the travelling West Indians for 25. Thirty-five years later, in another tour game, one that featured five West Indies players and four Irishmen who are part of the current squads, Ireland pulled off an upset again, chasing down 293 against Brian Lara's side. #p#With 13 professionals in their 15-man squad and a stunning win over England, things have looked up for Ireland this World Cup; a side determined for an encore. West Indies' demolition of a Bangladesh side that was expected to challenge them at home, preceded by a dominating performance against Netherlands, has helped them put behind a dispiriting loss to South Africa. Can their present do the same to some unsavoury recollections with the Irish? #p#In a keenly-contested Group where the fight for a berth in the quarter-finals is of greater intensity than the other, Friday's fixture will have a significant bearing on who goes through to the knockouts from this half. A win for West Indies will be a consolidation - a preparation for bigger tests that await them against India and England. A win for Ireland will put them in an excellent position to realise their pre-tournament objective of making it to the next stage, with a game against Netherlands, whom they'll expect to beat, in hand. #p#Form guide (completed matches, most recent first) West Indies : WWLLL Ireland : LWLWL #p#Watch out for... Ed Joyce : His return to Ireland ahead of the World Cup was a major boost, but the impact is yet to be felt. Forcing the pace has been a problem, two starts have been squandered and there's been one out-and-out failure when batting first. A player reputed for his solidity in the top and middle orders, Joyce is relied on to drop anchor. For that, he needs to spend long enough at the crease. #p#Kemar Roach : He's been West Indies' most promising pace prospect in years, and weaker teams that have come his way this tournament have been comfortably brushed aside. Ireland may be weaker on paper but their batting line-up is infused with plenty of grit and spunk, and is likely to offer more resistance against his fiery pace and accuracy. But on a track expected to favour seamers more than some others have this tournament, that ability to resist will be tested. #p#Pitch and conditions #p#"Being a non-India match, some grass has been left on the pitch, giving it a greenish tinge," Daljit Singh, the curator at the PCA Stadium, has said. "The first hour will help fast bowlers, but the batsmen can prosper with time as South Africa showed (scoring 330 against Netherlands) in the previous match." It was cloudy in Mohali even in the afternoon on Thursday, and if Friday's no different, fast bowlers will be kept interested for much longer than the first hour. #p#Team news #p#West Indies went in with two spinners in their previous game against Bangladesh. The seemingly favourable conditions for seamers in Mohali may just tempt them to replace a spinner with a seamer. Ravi Rampaul may get a look-in. #p#West Indies (possible): 1 Devon Smith, 2 Chris Gayle, 3 Darren Bravo, 4 Ramnaresh Sarwan, 5 Shivnarine Chanderpaul, 6 Kieron Pollard, 7 Devon Thomas (wk), 8 Darren Sammy (capt), 9 Sulieman Benn, 10 Ravi Rampaul, 11 Kemar Roach. #p#Trent Johnston was the best of Ireland's bowlers against India but picked up an injury after five overs and picking up two wickets. It will be a major blow for Ireland if he misses out on Friday, as it'll deprive them an experienced player with all-round abilities. In the event of his absence, Nigel Jones, a medium-pacer and a lower-middle order batsman, could be picked. #p#Ireland (possible): 1 William Porterfield, 2 Paul Stirling, 3 Ed Joyce, 4 Niall O'Brien (wk), 5 Andrew White, 6 Kevin O'Brien, 7 Alex Cusack, 8 John Mooney, 9 Nigel Jones/Trent Johnston, 10 George Dockrell, 11 Boyd Rankin. #p#Stats and trivia #p#Those two surprise wins in tour games aside, Ireland have faced West Indies thrice in ODIs and lost twice, their latest defeat as recent as April 2010. One game as washed out. #p#Left-arm spinners Sulieman Benn and George Dockrell have both picked up 25 wickets in ODIs, though the Irishman has done it in fewer games - 19 compared to 22 - at a better average and economy rate. Their opponents for the most part, though, have differed considerably in strength. #p#Quotes #p#"We have a lot of respect for them. They are a team that is improving constantly which shows their cricket is moving forward. We are definitely not taking them lightly. We have seen what they are capable of doing." Darren Sammy says the right things ahead of a crucial clash.
27	505211	Ireland v West Indies, World Cup 2011, Group B, Mohali	Ireland sweat on Johnston fitness	Nagraj Gollapudi in Mohali	March 10, 2011	#p#Ireland still do not know if Trent Johnston, their main fast bowler, will play against West Indies as they wait anxiously on his fitness. Johnston was one of the best bowlers in the tight loss against India last week in Bangalore, but a knee injury forced him off the field after delivering five overs in which he had taken two wickets. "He did a few laps of the ground, a few sprints and bowled a couple of overs, although it wasn't full pelt. But in the last over he ran in hard. We will see how reacts in the morning and make a call," William Porterfield, Ireland captain said. #p#Porterfield said that he had not spoken to Johnston after the nets as the bowler was on the physio's table, but remained optimistic. "Bowling 10 overs won't be a problem for him it seems. Standing on the park for 50 overs may be a problem. So we will wait and see how he shapes up tomorrow," Porterfield said. #p#If Johnston were to sit out it would be huge blow for Ireland, who need to win against West Indies to keep their quarter-finals hopes alive. Johnston has taken two wickets in each of Ireland's three previous matches and is their highest wicket-taker. His accuracy and seaming ability will make him a dangerous bowler on the Mohali pitch, which is on the greener side. #p#Porterfield is aware of the importance of Ireland's next few games. "We have three games left and we need to win at least two of them so every game is a massive one." #p#Trent Johnston went down injured during Ireland's match against India in Bangalore Getty Images Enlarge #p#Bowling aside, if Ireland have to survive their batsmen need to put up a good fight. Barring Porterfield, none of the other specialist batsmen like Ed Joyce, Paul Stirling, Niall O'Brien have got a fifty. This could be a golden opportunity for somebody like Joyce, who has only 52 runs from three matches so far, to stand up and deliver, but Porterfield does not think a dramatic change from their performance in previous games is necessary. "We just have to go out there and play the way we have played in the last three games," #p#Porterfield knows West Indies are coming into the match on the back of consecutive wins and that they are bound to derive motivation from their rousing win against Bangladesh in Dhaka where the trio of Kemar Roach, Sulieman Benn and Darren Sammy destroyed the Bangladesh batting in 18 overs. Roach would fancy taking the new ball early morning to do an encore tomorrow. But Porterfield is not nervous. "They have a lot of variations in their bowling, but we need to focus on what we are doing right." #p#Porterfield said Ireland had come far from the last time both sides met during the World Twenty20 in the Caribbean. "[It] wasn't a great performance on the day a couple of years ago in the Caribbean. But we were still a pretty confident side back then. We have done a lot of preparation but we have also grown in experience and stature since then. It has been a long time cricketing-wise. Our side is more experience and lot more confident in our ability."

Features : Pollard makes the difference Players/Officials: Ed Joyce | Kieron Pollard | Devon Smith Matches: Ireland v West Indies at Mohali Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Ireland | West Indies #p#<m11>West Indies opener Devon Smith made a maiden century</m11> but his effort was overshadowed by Kieron Pollard, who bludgeoned a limited Ireland attack all around Mohali to muscle his side to a tall total. Pollard's effort helped to quell the criticism over his lack of performances at the international level, and <m12>gave West Indies their third win in four matches</m12>, putting them in prime position for a quarter-final spot. #p#A fluent Ed Joyce steered Ireland's sprightly reply but they lacked the spark needed to chase down the substantial score, though for the fourth match in a row they showed they aren't out of their depth against top teams. They kept fighting even when hopes of a victory were lost, reducing <m13>the margin of defeat to 44 runs</m13> and ensuring that their net run-rate didn't take too big a hit. #p#The decision to replace the injured Chris Gayle with bowling allrounder Andre Russell meant West Indies had a long tail, and no batsman of note below No. 5. That meant Ireland would have been the happier side <m14>when West Indies crawled to 142 for 3 by the 35th over.</m14> The batsmen gambled by taking <m15>the batting Powerplay</m15> then; a wicket at that stage could have scuppered the innings, but Ireland couldn't make the vital breakthrough and were helpless as the power of Pollard helped ransack <m16>55 runs in five overs </m16>to shift the balance of the game. #p#<m17>Ireland had two opportunities to remove Pollard in the Powerplay</m17>: <m18>John Mooney narrowly missed a direct hit from square leg when Pollard had given up hope of making his ground in the 37th over</m18>, and <m19>Gary Wilson shelled a catch at long-on</m19> after hurtling across to get to a skier in the next over. #p#<m20>Over the next 45 minutes Pollard made them regret those misses with his now familiar brand of hitting, mainly muscling boundaries in the arc between long-on and midwicket</m20>. <m21>Boyd Rankin, Ireland's quickest, was brought in to handcuff Pollard, but his short ball was walloped to midwicket and an attempted yorker was pummeled down the ground.</m21> Rankin was rattled by the ferocity of the second hit, muttering to himself as his fractional mistake was punished. #p#<m22>A drive to midwicket in the 42nd over brought up Pollard's half-century off 35 balls - he celebrated by kissing an arm band bearing the injured allrounder Dwayne Bravo's number - but he was just warming up.</m22> The wickets tumbled at the other end, but there was no stopping <m23>Pollard, who capped a frenzy of hitting with 20 runs of an O'Brien over</m23>, which included <m24>a monstrous one-handed six that easily sailed over deep midwicket.</m24> #p#<m25>O'Brien had taken four wickets for the first time in his one-day career</m25>, but the Pollard assault ruined his figures. Pollard was also in line for the second quickest World Cup hundred -after O'Brien's epic against England last month - <m26>but fell attempting a six over long-off</m26>. #p#The pyrotechnics at the end made up for a dull start to the match in front of a nearly empty stadium when the West Indies openers treated the dibbly-dobbly attack with undue caution. <m27>There were only six fours in the first 15 overs on a track</m27> that, despite plenty of grass, afforded little movement for the seamers. #p#<m28>West Indies were dawdling at 3.5 runs per over when O'Brien struck in the 25th, getting Chanderpaul first</m28>, and <m29>Darren Bravo for a duck three balls later</m29>. <m30>Smith persevered and he stepped up his strike-rate in the Powerplay with a series of fours, reaching his hundred in the 39th over.</m30> It didn't thrill the watchers, but for a side which has only managed four centuries in their last 28 matches, it was an important innings. #p#Soon after, <m31>Kevin O'Brien struck twice in an over for the second time</m31>, though that didn't stop the runs. Puzzlingly, Ireland used their best bowler, left-arm spinner George Dockrell, for only three overs. #p#<m32>Ireland's chase got off to a terrible start as Paul Stirling's poor World Cup continued, dismissed in the second over.</m32> <m33>Joyce walked in and caressed his first two deliveries for four</m33> and <m34>Ireland sprinted to 35 for 0 in five</m34>, before <m35>Darren Sammy reeled off three maidens in a row</m35> and, combining with the pacy and accurate debutant Russell, created <m36>the pressure that led to William Porterfield's dismissal</m36>. #p#<m37>Joyce and Niall O'Brien steadied Ireland, adding 44 trouble-free runs</m37> before <m38>Niall played down the wrong line to Sulieman Benn</m38>. <m39>Joyce and Wilson then forged the biggest partnership of the innings to keep Ireland afloat</m39>, but just <m40>as Wilson picked up the pace with a huge six and two reverse-swept fours</m40>, <m41>Joyce was dismissed</m41>. <m42>Kevin O'Brien fell to a spectacular diving catch from Pollard and with that Ireland's hopes were washed away.</m42> #p#<m43>A controversial lbw decision by umpire Asoka de Silva, which wasn't reversed on referral, ended Wilson's stay in the 42nd over</m43>, but by then Ireland were hurtling towards <m44>their third defeat</m44>, and now need two wins to qualify for the next stage. #p#Match Timeline

ESPNcricinfo Ltd Enlarge Related Links News : Ireland slip at crucial moments. Players/Officials: Chris Gayle Matches: Ireland v West Indies at Mohali Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Ireland | West Indies #p#Nanny moment of the day #p#Thank heavens for Chris Gayle. This man can frustrate by not playing to his full potential and he can make you laugh with his original wit. He is an entertainer. Just before the national anthems were to be played in the morning Gayle realised the mascot accompanying him - all of two feet tall - was wailing for his mother, clearly unnerved by the big occasion. It was an extraordinary situation, one the organisers were not ready for and which raised anxiety levels with start time minutes away. But why worry when Gayle is around. As soon as he realised the issue he put his hands on the boy's shoulders, whispered a few kind words and watched as a big smile lit up the boy's face. #p#Missed chance of the day #p#<m1>Kieron Pollard tapped softly to leg off a legside delivery from Kevin O'Brien and set off for a single realising John Mooney was standing a little deep at square leg. Devon Smith refused to oblige, though, and Pollard - on 13 at the time - had to suddenly turned back to return to the crease but slipped in the process. That gave Mooney enough time to set himself up for the throw from an angle where he could have probably only seen one stump. Eventually he missed by a whisker but Pollard had in any case given up and walked back to safety.</m1> #p#Drop of the day #p#<m2>Next over Pollard went for a premeditated shot, trying to clear Andre Botha's fuller-length delivery on his legs over deep midwicket. The resultant top edge flew high and straight over the bowler's head. For a moment it seemed Gary Wilson, who had rushed in from long-on would catch it but, having lined himself nicely under the line of the falling ball, fumbled and the ball bounced out of his hands.</m2> <m3>Pollard was then on 19</m3> and went on to add 75 runs, effectively the difference between the two sides. Did Ireland drop the ticket to the quarter-finals there and then? #p#Spell of the day #p#<m4>8-3-21-1 by Darren Sammy</m4>. <m5>His first three overs were maidens.</m5> Pitching consistently on the button just short of length, he maintained a tight straight line that offered no width and kept the batsman rooted to the crease. It was a critical phase in the middle overs, when Ireland's progress was stalled. #p#Catch of the day #p#<m6>Kevin O'Brien hit flat and straight as Darren Sammy pitched short. The slow pace of the delivery meant O'Brien couldn't get the desired power behind the stroke but he probably felt he was safe as Pollard was standing inches inside the rope at long-on. But the West Indian had different thoughts as soon as he realised O'Brien had not got the momentum; he rushed out of the blocks like a long jumper in full stride and then threw himself as far as he could on the green turf. Even as he slid he kept his head high to watch the ball land into his outstretched hands - hands the size of baseball mitts. His reaction was a mix of ecstasy and some disbelief. It was easily one of the best catches this World Cup.</m6> #p#The Venus Williams moment #p#<m7>It was a ball from Sulieman Benn that straightened and hit Niall O'Brien's off stump.</m7> Cue Benn's reaction - a mixture of grunt and shriek that evoked - to this writer at least - images of Venus Williams celebrating a tight point won against one of the Russian girls.

Players/Officials: Kieron Pollard | Devon Smith Matches: Ireland v West Indies at Mohali Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Ireland | West Indies #p#Kieron Pollard saved West Indies' blushes after Ireland pushed them all the way with another whole-hearted performance in Mohali. In 31 previous ODI innings, Pollard had a highest score of 62 - which was one of only two half-centuries in this format - and his average stay at the crease was a mere 20 deliveries per innings. #p#From West Indies' point of view, Pollard could not have chosen a better time to get his highest in ODIs. <m2>His 94 from only 55 balls</m2> was the difference between the two teams. Leave aside his contribution, and West Indies' run-rate for the innings was 4.43; Ireland's innings run-rate was 4.71. #p#For much of the run-chase, Ireland were ahead of West Indies' total at the same stage. <m3>After 35 overs, Ireland were 157 for 3</m3>, compared to <m4>West Indies' 142 for 3</m4> - 15 runs to the good, same number of wickets in hand. #p#From there, things took a sudden turn as Pollard turned it up a couple of gears, while Ireland lost a couple of key wickets - including <m5>Gary Wilson's to a shocking umpiring decision by Asoka de Silva</m5> - and completely lost their momentum. After the 35th, West Indies had seven overs when they scored ten or more runs; Ireland only had one such over. #p#The way the two teams used the batting Powerplay was also key: West Indies's sequence from those overs was 12, 12, 10, 12, 9. Ireland, on the other hand, took <m6>their Powerplay</m6> when they'd already lost nine wickets, and most runs they managed from one of those five overs was nine. #p#West Indies' and Ireland's innings First 35 overs Last 15 overs West Indies score 142 for 3 133 for 7 Ireland score 157 for 3 74 for 7 West Indies 4s/ 6s 12/ 1 12/ 5 Ireland 4s/ 6s 16/ 1 8/ 0 West Indies and Ireland in the batting Powerplay Score 4s/ 6s Dot balls West Indies 55 for 0 6/ 2 7 Ireland 28 for 2 4/ 0 14 #p#More stats from the match. <m7>Pollard's knock</m7> is the second-fastest among innings in this World Cup which have lasted at least 50 balls.

In Focus: Technology in cricket Audio/Video: Boycott: 'Umpires at fault, not the DRS'. Players/Officials: Asoka de Silva | William Porterfield | Gary Wilson Matches: Ireland v West Indies at Mohali Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Ireland | West Indies #p#Umpiring in the World Cup has run into fresh controversy with Ireland captain William Porterfield strongly criticising <m2>Asoka de Silva's decision to give Gary Wilson out lbw despite replays showing the batsman had offered a shot to a delivery that replays clearly indicated had hit him outside the line.</m2> Porterfield's comments - unusually sharp for a team captain - came after a match which, he said, turned on that decision. #p#"I am still trying to understand it myself. The feedback we have got so far is that <m3>the ball hit him outside the line and the umpire judged him [to be] not playing a shot.</m3> I don't know how many people agree with that," Porterfield said after <m4>Ireland's 44-run defeat against West Indies</m4>. #p#<m5>The ball in question, delivered by West Indies captain Darren Sammy, pitched outside the off stump and cut in to hit the outside of Wilson's front pad. Wilson was trying to nudge it but failed but the Sri Lankan official thought he was offering no shot and raised his finger instantly. A surprised Wilson asked for a review. Third umpire Bruce Oxenford told de Silva that the ball had hit outside off and would, according to HawkEye, go on to hit the outside of the off stump. Replays on the big screen made that clear as also the fact that Wilson was actually trying to play the shot. Disappointed and confused, Wilson asked de Silva to refer the review this time. It was an extraordinary moment, which bordered on the comical, as de Silva went back to Oxenford once again. In the end, de Silva stuck to his stand and Wilson charged out, furiously shaking his head.</m5> #p#"If you see the replay on the big screen he could have still been able to reverse his decision from there. It was clearly seen he was playing the shot. (And) even though he [de Silva] judged that (wrongly) in the first place he saw the replays on the big screen," Porterfield said. He said that he did not have much time to discuss the issue with Wilson, who was not "in a great state of mind" when he came off the ground. "The word we are getting at the minute is the umpire went back upstairs to check if he hit the ball before the impact on the pad and if it was pad first, or bat first. Surely if you are asking if it was pad first or bat first, you know he is playing a shot. In my opinion they got it wrong." #p#Asked if the DRS was proving to be a nuisance rather than a help, Porterfield said he would not blame the reviews per se. "I would like to say it (DRS) was working but if you get a decision like that then I don't know. When you have all the technology, it is supposed to eradicate the mistakes and for me that did not happen this time." #p#Interestingly, Porterfield - speaking at the post-match press conference - had to stop briefly as Phil Simmons, the Ireland coach, walked in to have a few private words with a team official, who in turn relayed the message to Porterfield. The exchange, the media was told, was "off the record" #p#Porterfield admitted that <m6>Wilson's wicket</m6> was the turning point in Ireland's chase. <m7>Wilson had showed a wise head in the company of Ed Joyce</m7>, <m8>sharing a vital 91-run partnership for the fourth wicket</m8>. <m9>After Joyce departed</m9> Wilson took the onus on him and was playing fluently. Ireland needed 77 from 51 balls and <m10>the batting Powerplay</m10> was yet to be taken <m11>when Wilson was ruled out</m11>. "<m12>It was the pivotal moment in the game. It was not one of the things that cost us the game as there were other things we did</m12>," Porterfield said. "But it was a pretty crucial decision. He was going well. If we had taken the Powerplay we never know especially with Cusy [Alex Cusack] and John boy [Mooney] to come there." #p#One man who was more than happy <m13>to see the back of Wilson</m13> was Sammy. "I was happy that we got him out. That was the main focus for us, he back in the pavilion," he said. #p#But at the time of the incident, Sammy was intensely chatting to Wilson after de Silva's original decision. Asked if he saw Wilson's point, Sammy said personally he would not have argued with the umpire. "Umpires have been in charge ever since I started playing cricket. He did what he had to do," Sammy said. So what was he was making Wilson aware of? "I personally tried to tell him you know what, at the end of the day, the umpire said you are out so don't hang around because you don't really make an issue and get fined. We learned as a team that if the umpire says you are out, unless he tells you to hold on, you walk. You can always give your feedback in the captain's report." #p#Incidentally, Ireland were fined. But for another crime. Apparently they had bowled an over short and as a consequence Porterfield was penalised 20% of his match fee while the rest of the team had to take a 10% cut.

With an agile field providing ample support both men bowled a tight line and a perfect length. #p#Surprisingly the <m4>West Indies opening pair of Devon Smith and Shivnaraine Chanderpaul</m4> seemed like they were carrying putters instead of bats in hand as they carefully avoided playing any big strokes. Their circumspection only helped Ireland who cashed in. <m5>After 15 overs West Indies had not lost a wicket but a score of just 50 seemed a tad too slow.</m5> #p#Surprisingly the greenish tinge on the pitch had predicted a lot of seam movement and some early wickets for the fast bowlers. The perceived dawn raid by the fast men never came. Far from being dejected, the Ireland bowlers kept on leveraging the advantage. <m6>After 24 overs West Indies were on a far from promising 89</m6>. <m7>Next over Kevin O'Brien picked up two wickets.</m7> By the time the ball was replaced <m8>Ireland seemed in a dominant position at 138 for 3</m8>. #p#To get out of the hole they had dug themselves in, <m9>the pair of Smith and Kieron Pollard</m9> opted for <m10>the batting Powerplay</m10> immediately. And that is where Ireland faltered for the first time. <m11>George Dockrell, the left-arm spinner, had been introduced past the 30-over mark, but he had already stamped his authority by dismissing Ramnaresh Sarwan in his second over.</m11> <m12>In the following over he kept Pollard under check, giving only five runs.</m12> #p#<m13>Gary Wilson kept Ireland afloat but departed at a crucial time</m13>. Getty Images Enlarge #p#But for some unknown and unexplained reason he was removed. Thereafter Pollard established himself and snatched the game away from Ireland - <m14>57 runs came in those five overs when the field was in</m14>. <m15>West Indies smacked 133 runs off the final 15 overs.</m15> Dockrell remained busy on the ropes, fetching the ball instead of delivering it. #p#"I have no complaints for the boys. They bowled pretty well. Coming out <m16>in the first 15 overs I know we did not pick up any wickets but they were going at less than three [an over].</m16> That was a great effort. We picked up momentum there. We picked wickets at crucial times. But <m17>Kieron Pollard came in</m17> and played a great knock and it is hard to defend when he plays like that. We knew what power they had in the middle order and just had to try and contain them. You also have to give credit to Devon Smith the way he played. He did not find it easy to start with but he caught up coming forward in the middle overs," William Porterfield, the Ireland captain said. #p#He reckoned Ireland were still in the contest while they discussed the gameplan for the chase. "When we came out at half-time we it was a par score and very, very chaseable," he said. <m18>At the halfway stage Ed Joyce and Wilson had just started their union.</m18> <m19>Joyce, who had a sum of 52 runs in the previous three matches, had got off to the most fluent starts with two graceful cover drives as soon as he walked in.</m19> He continued to regale the senses with his wristy drives. Wilson was an able partner and both men steadily built a platform. Their settled minds caused distress for Darren Sammy, who was busy changing fields and swapping bowlers. #p#<m20>Even when Joyce left, bowled round the legs by Andre Russell</m20>, Wilson had immediately moved into a commanding position to take control. But just like he had taken the pressure off Joyce, he needed a man to stand by him. <m21>Kevin O'Brien disappointed and went for the big shots straightway and vanished quickly.</m21> Ireland could not bring the spirit of their Bangalore evenings to Mohali. Luck deserted the Irish today as <m22>Wilson perished to a questionable umpiring decision.</m22> #p#"We got ourselves into a pretty good position going <m23>into the last ten overs</m23>. The wicket changed a lot more than we maybe expected. It kept low and got slightly harder. We lost a few wickets at pretty crucial times. <m24>Niall and Ed partnership started the rebuilding</m24> and <m25>then Gary came and along with Ed they were going going pretty strongly</m25> till <m26>we lost a couple of wickets in the 40th over</m26> which delayed <m27>the batting Powerplay</m27> slightly which kind of set us back," was Porterfield's analysis.
27	505730	Ireland v West Indies, Group B, World Cup 2011, Mohali	Pollard shows West Indies a glimpse of the future	Nagraj Gollapudi in Mohali	March 11, 2011	#p#Kieron Pollard walked in today wearing a floppy hat. He switched to a helmet as soon as he heard big Boyd Rankin would be ready for him first-up but really Pollard need not have bothered - the way he batted today, it was the opposition that needed protection as he played the innings that will probably define his career. #p#His initial blast helped set a momentum lacking <m1>in the first 35 overs</m1>, a period when the West Indies top order wandered aimlessly. <m2>Pollard took 14 deliveries before playing his first big shot - a six with a neat flick of the wrists off Kevin O'Brien</m2>, no stranger to big hitting and the owner of the fastest World Cup century. <m3>Four balls later O'Brien fed Pollard the delivery the West Indian has built his million-dollar image on - pitched on length, Pollard cleared his front foot and smacked it over the bowler's head high into the stands.</m3> Strangely, like moths to a flame, the Irish bowlers tried attracting Pollard's attention with short balls. He hammered them with all his might and in no time <m4>he had reached his fifty</m4>. Even after the field had spread he knew he could create more chances <m5>in the final ten overs</m5>. The variations did not hurt him; in fact he didn't always go hell for leather. <m6>O'Brien bowled a wide delivery outside off, which Pollard steered past the third-man ropes.</m6> Sweet. #p#"Going into bat I was under a bit of pressure after a bit of a slow start," he said. "It was just a matter of backing myself which I am accustomed to doing. I was taking my chances and it came good." #p#With Chris Gayle missing, Pollard's role today was even more important. This was only the fifth time he was batting at No. 5, where he has now scored two of his three half-centuries. Batting higher up gives him time to settle; he gets more time to understand the bowler, the field setting and the pitch. Once in he can then pick the moment, the bowler and the spot where he would like to hit. It's not that he curbs his attacking instincts; he just sharpens it further. #p#Dwayne Bravo's exit from the World Cup has put Pollard in a position of enforcer and finisher. Among the world's top Twenty20 players, he's been grooming himself for the twin roles for a few years now. In a Champions League match against New South Wales in 2009, on a flat deck in Hyderabad, Trinidad & Tobago needed 51 off the final four overs. In one over Pollard - who'd started off slowly - hit Moises Henriques for 27 to turn the tables. #p#Kieron Pollard believes that this innings could be a stepping stone for him. AFP Enlarge #p#There isn't much that has changed in the last two years in Pollard the batsman. If anything he has evolved in his mind. The context does not matter to Pollard, just as it doesn't to Virender Sehwag or never did to Adam Gilchrist. Bowl these men a ball in their areas and they will punish you. Pollard doesn't have the same array of shots but he is not entirely handicapped. He hates allowing the bowler to dictate terms, yet at the same time he challenges the bowler to come at him. At times the bowler tries hard and Pollard flattens him with his power batting. #p#It's not all physical power; Pollard has started excelling in the mindgames too. He sets up the duel, adding a bit of verbal to whatever he's doing with bat or ball, and generally has a lack of fear that intimidates the opponent and creates doubts in his mind. That's all the chink he needs. #p#Today Ireland suffered those doubts. "You scratch your head a few times in a team meeting. He is a pretty special talent," William Porterfield, the Ireland captain, said. "He played at a crucial stage as well where they had to score quick runs and he got them into a good position." #p#Though he missed a maiden century, Pollard acknowledged the significance of the innings. "It is a stepping stone for me. I hope I can use this to go on and play better innings, and more frequently, for West Indies because the press is saying, and everyone is saying, Pollard hasn't really done anything in international cricket," he said. "There is no better stage than a World Cup to go forward." #p#Deep down Pollard must know the conflict is internal - he earned his reputation in the Twenty20 fields. If he has to prosper in the longer formats, he needs to come up more often with such performances. He could do with support from his captain Darren Sammy, who sat next to Pollard during the media briefing, wearing a contemplative look as Pollard spoke on his willingness to bat at any position the team wants. #p#West Indies need to have a re-think. The light is fast dimming on Shivnarine Chanderpaul and to an extent, on Ramnaresh Sarwan. Pollard has the arsenal and the hunger to become a good middle-order batsman. He needs the breaks.
28	505166	Bangladesh v England, World Cup 2011, Group B, Chittagong	Bangladesh seek rebirth of spirit	The Preview by Andrew Miller	March 10, 2011	#p#Match Facts March 11, Chittagong Start time 2.30pm (0830 GMT) #p#Jonathan Trott and Ian Bell are back in Bangladesh, just over a year since England's last ODI in the country Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: Ravi Bopara | Kevin Pietersen Matches: Bangladesh v England at Chittagong Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: England #p#The Big Picture This time last week, England's return to Chittagong was being viewed with the sort of FA Cup-style angst that accompanied Arsenal on their recent trip to Leyton Orient. On paper it was clearly a mismatch, with England having emerged victorious in all but one of their 22 previous fixtures, in all three formats of the game. However, in light of their calamitous three-wicket defeat against Ireland, the contest was being earmarked as a make-or-break moment in England's campaign. Another slip-up here, and the quarter-finals would surely be out of reach. #p#That, however, was before two extraordinary results redressed the shift towards Minnow Power in a remarkably unpredictable Group B. First came Bangladesh's capitulation to 58 all out at the hands of West Indies in Dhaka, as a game that could have hoisted them right into the reckoning for the knock-outs instead sent the team's morale spiralling, with the nation's mood following suit amid dark and reprehensible scenes outside the stadium. #p#Then, two days later, came England's incredible comeback against South Africa in Chennai, as the team somehow found the will to defend a limp total of 171, with all ten of South Africa's wickets tumbling for 102 in a thrilling six-run victory. The net effect of those two results has been to draw much of the sting from this Chittagong contest. It's certainly not out of the question for Bangladesh to progress to the next stage, especially with Netherlands among their remaining opponents. But right when it most matters, their bubble of optimism has been cruelly pricked, while at the same time, the fear of embarrassment that might have undermined England's approach has been significantly eased by their dispatching of one of the form teams of the tournament. #p#Nevertheless, these two teams know each other inside-out, with the first half of 2010 including four Tests and six ODIs, split home and away - and the shorter the format, the smaller the gulf between the teams. Bangladesh could and should have claimed the second ODI in Dhaka 12 months ago, only for a nerveless Eoin Morgan to seal a two-wicket victory with his maiden England century. Then at Bristol in July, the Tigers finally pounced, with Shafiul Islam's last-over dismissal securing an epic five-run victory. #p#The perverse logic of England's campaign also helps to fuel the prospect of an upset. At some stage, surely, they are going to have to break the cycle of underachievement whenever they've been burdened with the favourites' tag, but having been given extraordinarily close shaves by Canada in a warm-up match and then by Netherlands in their Nagpur opener, the Ireland defeat was an accident waiting to happen. Thrice bitten, four times shy? You'd assume they'd have to learn sometime. #p#Following that abominable effort against West Indies, Bangladesh will doubtless feel liberated with their expectations back at rock-bottom. The intervening days have been devoted to speculation about Shakib's position as captain, with a media furore accompanying a photo apparently showing him gesturing to the crowd during the post-match presentations at Mirpur. At times such as these, the safest place is often the middle of a cricket pitch. A decent start and a pumped-up crowd, and who knows what could be possible. #p#Form guide (completed matches, most recent first) Bangladesh LWLWW England WLTWL #p#Watch out for... England have had a rough time with injuries in the past few days, with Kevin Pietersen's hernia proving too much for the player to deal with, and Stuart Broad's side strain forcing him home early for the second time this winter. But the undeniable bonus is the return of Eoin Morgan , arguably the most innovative one-day batsman in the world game at present, and a man around whom England had built all of the strategies that have been so conspicuously absent from their suck-it-and-see approach to date. The broken finger he sustained in Australia has healed more quickly than anticipated, and he had been back in the nets with Middlesex before his SOS from Andy Flower. The aforementioned Dhaka century was a masterful example of how to finish a one-day innings. He's ready to start out again. #p#A calm 70 against India set the tone for Bangladesh's World Cup campaign, a violent 44 made the difference in a tight contest against Ireland. But never has Tamim Iqbal's importance to the Bangladeshi cause been so starkly demonstrated than during that debacle against West Indies. From the moment he chopped Kemar Roach to second slip in the first over of the match, the atmosphere was sucked clean out of the Shere-e-Bangla stadium, and with it the belief of all his team-mates. Against England, his role can only be amplified. He has smacked the small matter of three hundreds, two eighties and a pair of breezy fifties in his 11 matches to date, and by the end of the Tests in England, the bowlers' strategy was simply to wait for the hurricane to blow itself out. While he's still at the crease, Strauss and his men know they can't relax for an instant. #p#Team news So many permutations for England to consider, with a new opening batsman needed to take over from Pietersen, and a replacement bowler needed to fill in for Stuart Broad. The one given is that Morgan will revert to his favourite No. 5 position, where he and Ravi Bopara could form a potent combination in the latter stages of an innings. Earlier in the week, Ian Bell was talking like a man who'd been told to renew his first-wicket alliance with Andrew Strauss, although Matt Prior could yet be asked to take up that challenge once again. There is some speculation about England playing three spinners, with James Tredwell a potential addition alongside Michael Yardy and Graeme Swann. But Ajmal Shahzad, who claimed Tamim for a duck when England last played an ODI in Chittagong, is the likelier replacement for Broad. #p#England (probable) 1 Andrew Strauss (capt), 2 Ian Bell, 3 Jonathan Trott, 4 Ravi Bopara, 5 Eoin Morgan, 6 Matt Prior (wk), 7 Tim Bresnan, 8 Michael Yardy, 9 Graeme Swann, 10 Ajmal Shahzad, 11 James Anderson. #p#After a result such as the one they endured last week, the temptation might be to throw the baby out with the bathwater. However, Bangladesh have limited room for wholesale changes, and besides, the players who got their team into this mess ought to be the first to have to front up and get them out again. The one potential change is Mohammad Ashraful for Mahmudullah. Though Ashraful was picked primarily as a batsman, his allsorts spin bowling has proven to be the far stronger of his two suits to date. Mahmudullah, who is an offspinning allrounder, has a solid record against England including two Test fifties. #p#Bangladesh (possible) 1 Tamim Iqbal, 2 Imrul Kayes, 3 Junaid Siddique, 4 Raqibul Hasan, 5 Mushfiqur Rahim (wk), 6 Shakib Al Hasan (capt), 7 Mahmudullah, 8 Naeem Islam, 9 Abdur Razzak, 10 Rubel Hossain, 11 Shafiul Islam. #p#Pitch and conditions The weather has been dry and hot, though not unbearably so. The pitch promises to be a typical Chittagong strip of tarmac - dry and flat, with a touch of turn and low bounce. It was the livelier of the two surfaces on England's tour in 2009-10, though that is not saying much. #p#Stats and trivia England and Bangladesh have only faced each other once in previous World Cups - at Bridgetown in 2007 , when England ground to an unconvincing four-wicket win. #p#Tamim Iqbal has scored 730 runs at 48.66 in his 11 matches against England , including a run of six half-centuries in seven Test innings. His highest score against England, 125, came in his first match against them, the first ODI in Dhaka in February 2010. #p#Andrew Strauss has never played an ODI in Bangladesh, having been rested for last year's tour. He scored 154 in his last match against them, at Edgbaston in July 2010. #p#Quotes "The boys will be a bit tense, but we know if we play our best cricket, we can beat any side. They are confident enough to do the right things." Shakib Al Hasan expects an improved performance from his team. #p#"It's been great to be involved in some thrilling games. Personally I would have liked them to be a bit easier, I'd probably have a bit more hair on my head at this stage of the tournament. But we have shown a lot of character in a couple of those games certainly, and we want these last two games to be less close, to be honest." Andrew Strauss is hoping for a quieter match this time around
28	505469	Bangladesh v England, World Cup 2011, Group B, Chittagong	Contrasting talismen prepare for battle	Sidharth Monga in Chittagong	March 10, 2011	Andrew Strauss has been pivotal to England's batting this tournament AFP Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: Andrew Strauss | Tamim Iqbal Matches: Bangladesh v England at Chittagong Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Bangladesh | England #p#Andrew Strauss and Tamim Iqbal are as different as two characters and batsmen can be. Strauss, always well prepared, almost general-like, relies on taking emotion out of it when he goes out to bat or lead the side. He doesn't force you to the edge of your seats; in fact he makes you sit back further, his presence is reassuring. Tamim is not that easy on the watcher. He relies on the eye and the adrenalin. "Watch me," he seems to say every time he goes to bat. He is the loudest presence in team gatherings, be it nets sessions or matches or off the field. He is cool with the attention he gets; he knows he deserves it. #p#In another world, they could perhaps have been perfectly complementing opening partners; on Friday they remain crucial to their own sides' fortunes in their won different way. The two have one thing in common, though. They love playing each other. Strauss averages 99 in seven ODIs against Bangladesh at a strike-rate of 106, which are both a massive improvement on his overall statistics, 36 and 81 respectively. Two of his three 150-plus scores have come against them. In ODIs, Tamim's figures go up, not that drastically: he averages 32 and strikes at 105 runs per 100 balls against England, as opposed to 30 and 80 respectively. It is still a considerable show of affection for the English attack, especially when you see his Test record against England, an average of 63 and two of his four hundreds. #p#It is hardly any surprise, though, that Strauss should do well against Bangladesh. Their attack is based more on containment getting wickets than wickets getting containment. For accumulators, for workers of singles, for batsmen who don't panic or get overly restless after four-five low-scoring overs, this attack doesn't pose that much of a challenge. Plus his being a left-hand batsman negates Bangladesh's left-arm spinner a bit, something Strauss himself acknowledges. #p#On the other hand, Tamim preys on unsettled bowlers. And England, skilful as their attack might be, are not the most consistent bowling unit. They are a bit like Indian attack who are irresistible when they are good, but uninspiring when bad. Tamim takes his chances, and tries to lay into them early. In Tests, more than in ODIs, it has worked, except that the batsmen following him haven't made full use of the starts Tamim has given them against England. #p#In the week after the embarrassment against West Indies, Bangladesh - the team and the country - have looked to Tamim even more than they usually do. It's not always just the runs that he scores. When Tamim does well, he lifts the whole team up. The rest of the batsmen become more confident when he does well. #p#And in the last week, Tamim seems to have taken the extra responsibility to try and bring the team out of the shock of 58 all out. Two days ago, he took them all out to play golf and fish, away from the media attention, away from former players' criticism, away from thinking about the disaster last week. He has been cheerful at the nets sessions, and has had the air of a man who knows he has the ability to bring a turnaround. #p#"Very dangerous player," Strauss says of Tamim. "We know clearly he takes the game to the opposition. He has done well against England in the past. I think we know a little bit more about him as a player now, but we are going to have to make sure we get our plans right straightaway from ball one, otherwise he will get off and running." #p#Strauss himself doesn't make too much of his record against Bangladesh, mostly because "I haven't played against them in Bangladesh, so that's going to be a different scenario for me" Apart from that, Strauss also knows his side hasn't been too good with banana peels this tournament. He helped them out after the stumble against Netherlands, but Ireland proved to be too slippery. On the evidence of the matches so far, Strauss knows his side can lose to Bangladesh, more so now that they are without Kevin Pietersen and Stuart Broad. #p#Strauss has decided on his opening partner, but is keeping his cards close to his chest. What is not a secret is that Strauss will want to do the job himself, add to his dominance of Bangladesh, and just make sure there are no more stutters before they qualify for the quarter-finals. As the captain of the side, he will also have to plan how to keep Tamim quiet.

In reply, however, and in dew-laden conditions that made the ball tricky to grip - particularly for their cantankerous spinner, Graeme Swann - <m15>Bangladesh were on cruise control at 155 for 3 in the 31st over</m15>, before <m16>a calamitous run-out gifted their opponents a way back into the game.</m16> #p#<m17>The man who had the game in the palm of his hand was the eventual - and rightful - Man of the Match Imrul Kayes, the less-vaunted of Bangladesh's opening batsman, who slipstreamed Tamim Iqbal during a captivating 38 from 26 balls that put Bangladesh firmly ahead of the run-rate, before settling down to play the holding role with a chanceless 100-ball 60</m17>. #p#Chanceless, that is, except for his sketchy running between the wickets. <m18>For it was his ill-advised decision to take a second run to deep square leg</m18> that <m19>ended a fourth-wicket stand of 72 with Shakib Al Hasan</m19> that looked to have broken the back of England's resistance. <m20>In the next five overs, as Bresnan and Paul Collingwood applied the emergency brake, Bangladesh were limited to seven singles</m20> before <m21>Shakib - gasping to lift the tempo after a doughty 58-ball innings - aimed a loose sweep at Swann and was bowled for 32.</m21> #p#<m22>Mushfiqur Rahim had been virtually strokeless since the run-out, with two runs from 18 deliveries</m22> before the re-introduction of Ajmal Shahzad persuaded him to drive expansively through the covers. But <m23>one ball later he edged a beauty on off stump through to Matt Prior</m23>, and <m24>before another run had been added, Shahzad produced another superb delivery to take out Naeem Islam's off stump for a duck.</m24> #p#It was a near-replica of the delivery <m25>that had earlier sent Raqibul Hasan on his way in the same manner</m25>, and <m26>with eventual figures of 3 for 43, Shahzad was England's most successful bowler of the day</m26>. In between whiles, however, his line had been all over the shop - a performance that too many of his team-mates had been willing to emulate, not least James Anderson, who had borne the brunt of Tamim's early onslaught, and later served up <m27>a dreadful nine-ball first over of the batting Powerplay</m27> - including <m28>five wides first-ball</m28> - to give Bangladesh real belief in the closing stages. #p#That belief had been ignited by the swinging blade of <m29>Shafiul, who turned a bad day for Swann into a dreadful one by leathering his final over for 16</m29>, including <m30>the only six of the day, over wide long-on</m30>. Up until that point, Swann had been more preoccupied with the wet and slippery ball, with Andrew Strauss forced to intervene during a heated row with umpire Daryl Harper, but those blows brought <m31>the requirement down to 39 from 48 balls</m31>, and brought an abrupt halt to the flow of disgruntled fans who were trooping out of the stadium. #p#This was the day that Bangladesh had been rehearsing for all through 2010. They got to know England's cricketers and strategies through the course of back-to-back series at home and away, and having ended their run of 20 consecutive defeats with a tight victory at Bristol in their last-but-one encounter in July, they knew they had what it takes to spring a surprise. But, having collapsed in a heap to be bowled out for 58 in their last World Cup fixture against West Indies, the chance to start from the position of rank outsiders seemed to suit their purposes every bit as much as the favourites' tag unsettled their opponents. #p#Smart Stats. <m32>Bangladesh's two-wicket win</m32> is only their second against England in 15 ODIs. It is also their fourth win over a Test-playing team in World Cups. The target of 226 chased by Bangladesh is the highest successfully chased one in ODIs in Chittagong. The previous best was 222 for 9 by Bangladesh against Zimbabwe in 2009. <m33>The 58-run stand between Mahmudullah and Shafiul Islam</m33> for the ninth wicket is the third highest for Bangladesh in ODIs. <m34>Eoin Morgan scored his first fifty in World Cups</m34>. He now has 154 runs from ten innings at an average of 15.40. In ODIs overall, he averages nearly 39 with four hundreds and 11 fifties. <m35>Ajmal Shahzad's haul of 3 for 43</m35> is his third-best in ODIs and his best performance in World Cups. <m36>The two-wicket win</m36> is the fourth in World Cups and the third such win to come against England. #p#With the honourable exception of the fit-again Morgan and the unflappable Trott, England simply did not look comfortable at any stage of the day. After losing the toss and being asked to set the agenda, <m37>they shipped three tame wickets in the space of their first 17 overs</m37>, as they dribbled along to <m38>53 for 3</m38>, and though <m39>Trott was admirable in grinding out a 99-ball 67</m39>, <m40>it was Morgan's departure for 63 to a fine catch by Kayes at backward square</m40> that derailed their ambitions of a 250-plus total. <m41>Their batting Powerplay</m41> once again proved problematic, with <m42>33 runs and two wickets coming in five overs</m42>, and from <m43>162 for 3 with 11.3 overs remaining</m43>, <m44>England were bowled out for 225 with two balls of their innings remaining</m44>. #p#<m45>The left-arm spin of Abdur Razzak was especially impressive. It was he who stunted England's ambitions with his first-ball removal of Matt Prior (who produced one of the doziest dismissals of the tournament to date, when he set off for a single with the ball already nestled in Mushfiqur's gloves)</m45> and he did not concede a single boundary until <m46>Ravi Bopara larruped the third ball of his final over through the covers.</m46> Even then, <m47>Razzak had the last laugh, as two balls later Bopara tried the same trick and picked out Naeem Islam in the covers.</m47> #p#It was Razzak's earlier spell that set the tone, however, as he and Naeem squeezed all ambition out of England's top-order in a boa-like alliance that resulted in 19 singles and nothing else between overs 7 and 16. <m48>Strauss reclaimed his status as the tournament's leading run-scorer in the course of his 31-ball 18</m48>, but the fluency that had been the hallmark of his previous performances was nowhere to be seen as he eventually took on a cut shot that was too close to his body, and <m49>skidded a fast edge to Junaid Siddique at slip.</m49> <m50>And then Ian Bell, nominally England's best player of spin, produced a timid aberration of an innings, which ended with a flaccid flick to short midwicket off Mahmudullah.</m50> #p#England's own trump spinner couldn't come close to matching the efforts of Bangladesh's quartet. Right from his first over, Swann was troubled by the dew-sodden ball and struggled to locate the flight, line and length that had proved so devastating in a similar situation against South Africa last week. England regained a small measure of control when the umpires agreed to a ball-change after 21 overs, and <m51>Swann was instantly in the thick of things with a tidy fourth over that went for two runs.</m51> However, <m52>the more notable aspect of the over was Swann's petulance when called for a leg-side wide that might have brushed Shakib's pad.</m52> Aside from the extra run, it was a sign that England were getting very seriously rattled. #p#In the final analysis, however, there could be no quibbling with the result. The only reason that England were even given a chance of victory was that both sides knew of Bangladesh's tendency to collapse under pressure. Sure enough, the choke when it came was dramatic and could have been game-changing, but thanks to <m53>the guts of Shafiul and Mahmudullah</m53>, justice was served in the end. #p#Last week Bangladesh were being showered with brickbats - literally - after a spineless surrender in Dhaka. This evening those same players will be garlanded by a jubilant nation, and with a match against Netherlands still lying in wait, they now have a real chance to propel themselves to the quarter-finals. England, meanwhile, must ride the rollercoaster for the sixth match in succession. Another slip-up, and this time it really will be the end. #p#Match Timeline
28	505648	Bangladesh v England, World Cup 2011, Chittagong	Rahim's presence of mind	Sidharth Monga in Chittagong	March 11, 2011	Mushfiqur Rahim: alert behind the wickets. Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Matches: Bangladesh v England at Chittagong Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Bangladesh | England #p#The review of the tournament. Not. It will take something to beat this one as the poorest review of the World Cup, even if you were to make allowance for the fact that <m1>it was Daryl Harper whose decision was challenged. It was in the second over of the day when Rubel Hossain beat Andrew Strauss on the pull. After a long deliberation, Bangladesh went for the review, but apart from the fielders, everybody at the ground knew it pitched way outside leg and was bouncing over the stumps.</m1> The rest was okay. #p#Presence of mind. Mushfiqur Rahim might have dropped Eoin Morgan today, but <m2>his stumping of Matt Prior was a superb example of alertness. Prior had overbalanced as Abdur Razzak bowled wide down the leg side, and Mushfiqur had whipped the bails off fast enough, but when he saw Prior was making no attempt to get back to the crease, Mushfiqur took the whole stump out, just in case. Just as well that he did that, for the replays showed Prior was safe in the first instance.</m2> One keeper was at the top of his game then, the other wasn't. #p#The tease. <m3>In the 25th over of England's innings, Eoin Morgan called Jonathan Trott for a tight single, and TV replays showed it was touch and go even after many replays. The bat seemed to be on the line, but the time it took to make the decision had the crowd resigned to the fact that it was not conclusively out. And then when the verdict came out on the big screen, they yelled in joy, because for a split second the screen said only "out" Only for the "not" to appear soon, and end their joy.</m3> #p#The contest. It is no secret that Andrew Strauss loves to cut and pull. Once the spinners came on pretty early in the England innings, an interesting contest was on. Naeem Islam maintained the immaculate in-between length, and Strauss still kept trying to cut. First attempt: <m4>Naeem gets the line right, Strauss rocks back, cuts off the middle-stump line, finds point.</m4> Second attempt: <m5>he gets slight width, creates his length by going deep into the crease, and cuts it fine of backward point.</m5> Third attempt: <m6>again not too short, and no room, Strauss is beaten, but the ball misses the top of middle.</m6> Fourth attempt: <m7>Strauss gets the width but can't place it square enough, and gets a single to deep cover.</m7> Fifth attempt: <m8>again Strauss manufactures the length, but fatally so, as the ball hurries onto him and the edge is pouched at slip.</m8> Fair to say Naeem had earned himself a send-off after playing so well on Strauss's strength. #p#The grey area. Hardly a day goes by when DRS doesn't introduce us to a new shade between black and white. This one wasn't as grey and grave as what Asoka de Silva showed us in the West Indies-Ireland game, but is still worth a nerdy thought. <m9>Graeme Swann and Matt Prior went for a catch down the leg side, but Daryl Harper called the delivery a wide. Everybody except for the umpire knew this wasn't a wide, but they also knew the ball had hit the pad. Andrew Strauss later said they didn't want to review it because while it would have overturned the wide call, it would have cost them a review. Why cost a side a review when the umpire is actually admitting to have made a mistake?</m9>

Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: Mahmudullah | Shafiul Islam Matches: Bangladesh v England at Chittagong Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Bangladesh | England #p#Bulu makes sure the photographers and cameramen are provided cables, internet and all that sort of stuff during matches in Bangladesh. That's his official duty. What endears him to travelling journalists, though, is that, out of hospitality and generosity, he makes sure the reporters get water when water and shade from sun are at a premium during the teams' training sessions. Every time he sees you at the ground, he asks you if you have had your meal. If you haven't, he does something about it. He does the same for the Bangladesh players too. He loves his team. #p#Bulu wasn't his jovial self tonight, however. Bangladesh were going down; it wasn't a meek surrender like the one against West Indies, but they were fighting and going down nonetheless. <m2>At 169 for 8</m2>, they were down for the count. But in the next 56 deliveries, they not only beat the count, they waded in with counter-blows too. Moments after <m3>Mahmudullah had driven Tim Bresnan for the match-winning four</m3>, Bulu came back to full life. He went on a victory lap. The whole groundstaff followed him. The crowd, the faithful who had stayed to the bitter end, ran towards the front rows. Bulu jumped boundary boards and hugged the photographers. He came up and hugged us in the press box. Bulu is just one of the millions who will be behaving this way tonight up and down the country, hugging delighted strangers on the street. #p#Sport's ability to uplift can never be overstated. These were the scenes this World Cup desperately needed. These were the scenes Bangladesh needed after last week's embarrassment. These were the scenes the team representing some of the most passionate fans in the world needed. The country that opened its arms to the World Cup needed this kind of backing from its team too. #p#Matches, though, are not won by passionate fans, although they play their part at times. Matches are not won because countries need it. Matches are won by deserving teams, and tonight Bangladesh were nothing if not deserving. #p#Just imagine the kind of pressure this young team was under. They had just been bowled out for 58, their lowest-ever total. They had former players on their backs. They also knew that their passionate followers were no different to many Indian and Pakistani fans. They knew their houses could be attacked if they lost. They would have heard authorities trying to sell the theory that the stones thrown at the West Indies bus were actually meant for the Bangladesh bus, as if in a way, it was the done thing. #p#Keeping all that in mind, and also Bangladesh's position in the points table in a home World Cup where they should be coming close to making the quarter-finals, if not actually doing so, this has to be one of Bangladesh's most important victories of all time. Before the World Cup started, Mashrafe Mortaza was at the Bangladesh nets. He was discussing the team's chances with a few journalists, and made a very pertinent observation. The bigger sides, he said, can manage to win through one-man shows, but for Bangladesh to win, they would need contributions from a larger group of players. Up until this game, those words have come true: except for the game against Ireland, where the bowlers all chipped in, Bangladesh just hadn't been able to put together a cluster of meaningful performances. #p#Today, however, they were vintage Bangladesh - the good Bangladesh that is. None of their bowlers bowled badly. There was no weak link. How James Anderson would have wished to say the same of England. They weren't at their best in the field, but <m4>Mushfiqur Rahim showed amazing presence of mind to stump Matt Prior.</m4> Even when England revived with <m5>a strong stand between Eoin Morgan and Jonathan Trott</m5>, Bangladesh didn't look lost. Shakib Al Hasan was proactive. He saw Morgan was having little trouble with spin, and brought Rubel Hossain back. Mushfiqur might not have held onto the edge he produced first ball, but Bangladesh were on the ball mentally, unlike in the game against India. #p#When <m6>the Batting Powerplay</m6> was called, Shakib took the responsibility himself. Tactically he might not be the best leader, but Shakib has a big heart. With him was the most experienced bowler in the side, Abdur Razzak. Between them they knew their fields well, and bowled exactly what they wanted to. But that was the easy part. Getting their bowling to operate as a unit has been the basis of Bangladesh's improved fortunes in recent months. #p#It's the batsmen who have disappointed more often. Tonight, however, they showed they had learned their lesson. It was a massive improvement. Except for Tamim Iqbal, who has licence to play extravagantly, nobody went for the adventurous shots. The running between the wickets, like the fielding, wasn't great, but the batsmen were not melting in the heat, they genuinely wanted to outlast the tough times. <m7>Even when three wickets fell in a hurry after Tamim's start</m7>, you could sense this was different from their batting efforts against Ireland and West Indies. #p#Even if they had lost tonight, Bangladesh could have held their heads high. They had chosen some seriously good deliveries to get out to - particularly those bowled by Ajmal Shahzad. But all the same, holding their heads high and accepting the valiant losses is not good enough anymore. More is expected of Bangladesh now. That more includes winning in pressure situations too. In <m8>Shafiul Islam and Mahmudullah</m8>, they found that more tonight. #p#When they wake up tomorrow, two days before their game against Netherlands, Bangladesh will realise having one such night is not enough anymore. Victories such as these merely increase the expectation from supporters such as Bulu. But they will also realise that if they refuse to give up more often, like they did tonight, they will have more such nights. Two more in quick succession will be welcome in this World Cup.
28	505738	Bangladesh v England, World Cup, Group B, Chittagong	Shakib savours 'huge victory'	Sidharth Monga in Chittagong	March 11, 2011	#p#Shakib Al Hasan couldn't keep his emotion in check <m1>after it was all over</m1>. He and his side have been through a lot over the last week, and they desperately needed <m2>a win</m2>. The fashion that desperately needed win came in, following twists and turns every step of the way, would have left the toughest of men exhausted, and Shakib is not one of the best at hiding his feelings, be it about his critics or underperforming or unfit players. Or be it after a special win. #p#"<m3>It's not a normal win</m3>," Shakib said. "Obviously if you look at the situation, and the whole scenario of Bangladesh, <m4>it is a huge victory</m4> for us. And for the whole nation I think. Not really [an emotional win], although I became a little bit emotional at one stage. Some of the boys showed their character, how tough they are, how hard they can work. So that paid off." #p#It started with all their bowlers coming together and putting on a special show to <m5>restrict England to 225</m5>. Then the batsmen cut out the mistakes of the past, put their heads down, and didn't go for the easy option of playing flashy shots camouflaged as an attempt to counterattack. Shakib said they have been trying to bring that element into their game without really losing out on the intent. "We knew that if we have to win games, we have to score runs, so we are always score runs. Yes, you can say that we are a bit more careful in our shot selection." #p#Emotion filled the stadium after <m6>Bangladesh secured their narrow victory</m6>. Getty Images Enlarge #p#Yet England came back superbly with some excellent bowling in the middle overs to leave <m7>Bangladesh 169 for 8</m7>. Some poor running from Bangladesh didn't help, either, and Shakib sees room for improvement. "At one stage, <m8>when me and Imrul [Kayes, Man of the Match for his 60] were batting</m8>, I thought we were going really well," he said. "There were some silly mistakes, like <m9>the two run-outs</m9> that could have cost us the game. <m10>My wicket was crucial too. It wasn't the time to play that shot.</m10> Hopefully we will learn from those mistakes. One thing we can learn is, whoever gets in should score big runs. Not 30s and 40s." #p#That said, Shakib admitted to having given up hope even though Mahmudullah and Shafiul Islam hadn't. "I thought we had lost the game," Shakib said. "<m11>When Riyad hit the winning shot</m11>, I still couldn't believe <m12>we had won the game</m12>. It took me some time to realise that, yes, we had won. I was lying down on the physio bed and watching the game. I Was having a chat with Tamim [Iqbal] and [Abdur] Razzak how badly we all played. We were just discussing our game, and having a chat." #p#Shakib added <m13>the win</m13> reiterated his belief in the team, and that the positive noises before the game came out of genuine confidence in the side's ability of coming back. "Yes, I always have the belief in my team," he said. "We have really good guys who are honest about their work, they can work really hard, day in, day out. If you have a bunch of guys like we have, we will always have the belief we can come back from any situation."
28	505740	Bangladesh v England, World Cup, Group B, Chittagong	Dew dampens England's spirits	Sidharth Monga in Chittagong	March 11, 2011	#p#Andrew Strauss pinpointed the evening dew in Chittagong as a factor that severely hampered England as they slipped to <m1>a two-wicket defeat</m1> but refused to blame his team's loss on the conditions. In the first half of Bangladesh's chase the dampness caused major problems, especially to Graeme Swann, and meant England had a lot of ground to claw back. #p#Although Strauss said that these were not win-toss-win-match conditions, he also believe it wasn't right that the spinner's role was effected so heavily. "Something [is] not quite right when a spinner can't grip the ball in these conditions, in these parts of the world, where spin plays such an important role." #p#As a result of the dew, England couldn't use Swann, the only spinner in the side, exactly the way they would have wanted to. "There was a 20-over period when it was very very bad," Strauss said. "Obviously Graeme couldn't grip the ball. That was hard work for us. It wasn't the reason we lost the game, I don't think, but certainly there was quite considerable dew there." #p#With the ball getting wet, Swann got into an argument with umpire Daryl Harper, who refused to have the ball changed as often as Swann wanted. <m2>Including the mandatory change at 34 overs</m2>, the ball was switched three times according to Strauss. Swann was later fined 10 percent of his match fee for violating the ICC's Code of Conduct. He was deemed to have breached article 2.1.4, which relates to "Using language or a gesture that is obscene, offensive or insulting during an international match." #p#"Graeme was obviously very frustrated that he couldn't grip the ball," Strauss said. "He felt he had a big role to play in the game. For a period we had to take him off, until later on when he could grip it. It was frustrating for him, it was frustrating for all of us that the ball got as wet as it did. That happens, that's the conditions we encounter." #p#Graeme Swann became very animated with Daryl Harper over the damp ball. Getty Images Enlarge #p#At one point the exhange Swann was threatening to boil over in his frustration and Strauss had to step in. "Graeme was asking to change the ball. I wasn't there, I don't know what was said between the two of them," Strauss said. "Once the exchange happened, I told Graeme to calm down and get on with it, and he did do so." #p#Strauss knew, though, that dew wasn't why England lost their second group match of a rollercoaster campaign. "<m3>Losing three wickets early</m3> certainly didn't help us," he said. "It was a pretty low, slow, stodgy wicket this afternoon. We needed wickets in hand to get to 240-250, which would have been a very good score. #p#"As it was, Eoin Morgan played exceptionally well I thought, and obviously Jonathan Trott stuck in there. We thought it was a par score, we thought we could defend it, and we got ourselves into a great performance to defend it. In the end we weren't able to take those last two wickets, which is desperately disappointing for us." #p#However, Strauss did make a pertinent observation about the dew. "One thing I would say is, it feels slightly strange to have the first ever day-nighter at a certain ground in a World Cup. So perhaps a lesson to be learned there." That obviously hasn't been a consideration in the tournament: the teams in Group A are playing at venues in Sri Lanka that are hosting their first matches, day-night or otherwise.
28	505741	Bangladesh v England, World Cup, Group B, Chittagong	The rollercoaster dives again	Sidharth Monga in Chittagong	March 11, 2011	<m1>Ajmal Shahzad took three wickets</m1> to put England on the brink but they could not seal victory. Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: James Anderson | Ajmal Shahzad | Andrew Strauss | Graeme Swann Matches: Bangladesh v England at Chittagong Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Bangladesh | England #p#After England had produced yet another thriller, this time <m2>a two-wicket loss to Bangladesh</m2>, Andrew Strauss was asked how England could conceivably win the World Cup after having lost to the co-hosts and Ireland. The question makes sense, for England have lost two of the nailbiters that they were in a very good position to win; they have tied a game they should have at various points lost, won and lost; and they have won two games where they had played themselves into losing situations. #p#Strauss paused before answering. He looked for the right words. Then he said: "We still believe we can. We have put in some very inconsistent performances. We still haven't had a game where our batting and bowling fire at the same time, but we need to do it pretty quickly now. We have got to have to do it in the last game against the West Indies." Not quite Steve Waugh's simple-we-have-to-win-every-match from the 1999 World Cup, but the closest a non-dramatic captain such as Strauss can get to it. #p#Critics will lay into England, and not unfairly either. <m3>They gave away 23 runs in wides</m3> in a defence of 225, James Anderson and Ajmal Shahzad bowled rubbish at the start, Anderson bowled rubbish at the end, too, and their batsmen didn't capitalise on <m4>the 109-run fourth-wicket stand between Eoin Morgan and Jonathan Trott</m4> that helped them recover from a poor start. #p#Still there has been a lot to recommend England in this tournament. And it's not just the knack of producing close games, something if you told Strauss now, he wouldn't find amusing. They have been the most perplexing side in the event so far, losing as they have to Ireland and Bangladesh, but beating as they did South Africa from a hopeless position. #p#Yet, except for the Ireland match, there hasn't been a game where they haven't made a comeback, ranging from notable to the remarkable. That is a trait you wouldn't associate with the English teams of the past, to make comebacks on such a regular basis, and not always from expected quarters. In the game against India - a chase of 338 - England not only put themselves into a winning position, but also tied the game from a losing position they had contrived to subsequently find themselves in. They haven't won as often as to inspire confidence, but at least they have the knowledge they have the people to put them back into the contests. #p#In Chittagong, after a slightly under-par score and a horrible start with the new ball - <m5>Bangladesh were 50 for 0 in the eighth over</m5> - they did a lot right. <m6>Shahzad produced three near unplayable deliveries to get his wickets</m6>, <m7>Tim Bresnan found a way through Tamim Iqbal with some extra pace and skid</m7>, <m8>Anderson produced a smart run-out</m8>, and <m9>Graeme Swann took out two despite the dew</m9>. #p#That they didn't seal the deal was "desperately disappointing", as Strauss put it, but he is not talking from wonderland when he says their performance hasn't "dropped off" "I don't think we are necessarily dropping off," he said. "We beat South Africa in the last game, and we did some good things in this game, but not enough to win it. Our performance hasn't dropped off. It has just been inconsistent, which is not something we want to be making a habit of, and clearly we need consistency from now on if we want to progress in the tournament." #p#They have also been fun to watch because going by formbook and traditional wisdom, they have no business competing at a World Cup. They have too many old-fashioned nudgers to survive in the hard-hitting, high-scoring subcontinent, they have had too many injuries, they have had too long a tour leading into the tournament, and have therefore not been at their freshest. In other words, they have ticked off almost all the boxes Pakistan usually tick when they decide to confound everybody and win a big tournament. "World Cups are funny things," Strauss said, now knowing that the next loss will be his side's last in this World Cup. "You can gain confidence just at the right moment, and get a real run of form just when you need it." #p#Yes, England have been fun to watch and all that, but right now they need access to that Pakistan-like space. With Pakistan winning their first three games to move towards the quarter-finals, before their slip-up against New Zealamd, we could do with a team that just about scrapes through in the early rounds, and then finds a "run of form just when you need it" Knowing how England did just that in the World Twenty20 last year, it's still not quite impossible.
28	506235	Bangladesh v England, World Cup, Group B, Chittagong	Swann defiant despite ICC fine	ESPNcricinfo staff	March 14, 2011	#p#Graeme Swann has apologised for his behaviour during <m1>England's two-wicket defeat against Bangladesh at Chittagong</m1> on Friday, but still believes the ICC was wrong to fine him 10% of his match fee, as he described the decision to play a day/night match in such dew-heavy conditions as "ludicrous" #p#On a low and spin-friendly surface, Swann's offbreaks were expected to be one of England's key weapons as they set about defending a below-par total of 225. However, on a ground that was hosting its first day/night fixture, it soon became clear that the early-evening dew would be a significant factor, with the wet conditions leading to three ball-changes in the course of Bangladesh's innings. #p#"I was wrong to swear and lose my temper during <m2>England's defeat against Bangladesh</m2> and I apologised straightaway to umpire Daryl Harper," Swann wrote in his column in The Sun. "But I think it was ludicrous to play a day/night match in the World Cup that was so heavily influenced by the dew. The ball was so wet it was like trying to bowl with a bar of soap." #p#Swann's frustration was apparent right from the start of his spell as he regularly stopped midway through his run-up, and at one stage he was heard swearing over the stump microphone as he served up a long-hop that was cut through point. "My frustration boiled over on Friday evening and I was trying to get the ball changed," he said. "It was changed three times in total but it should have been changed every two or three overs. It felt like playing football with both hands tied behind my back. #p#Graeme Swann became very animated with Daryl Harper over the damp ball. Getty Images Enlarge #p#"To be caught swearing by the stump mic was very disappointing," he added. "I don't condone bad language on the field, especially if it is directed near the umpire. Of course, the dew wasn't the umpires' fault but every time the replacement rolled across the outfield, it became drenched. I was muttering things to myself under my breath that were far worse and I'm glad they weren't picked up. Andrew Strauss told me to calm down, which was fair enough. I apologised to Daryl, saying, 'Sorry, that was out of line'." #p#Despite admitting he was in the wrong for his outburst, Swann was adamant that the ICC's sanction was unnecessary. "My punishment was to be docked 10 percent of my match fee but I shouldn't be fined at all," he said. "When you have venues where the dew is heavy, day/night cricket shouldn't be played there. At some grounds, spin bowlers might as well not play if they have to bowl at night." #p#England's failure to overcome Bangladesh has left their World Cup fate dangling by a thread. They need to beat West Indies in their final Group B fixture in Chennai on Thursday to stand any chance of going through to the quarter-finals, and even then they will need at least one of their three main rivals for fourth place - Bangladesh, West Indies and South Africa - to lose their remaining matches. #p#"Following England in this World Cup is a bit like following Newcastle United - you never know what you're going to get," said Swann. One minute we're beating South Africa, the next we're losing to Ireland and Bangladesh. We have no chance unless we sort out our consistency, and although it has been a long, hard winter, we need to ask ourselves some questions if we can't pull it out the bag for the World Cup."

AFP Enlarge Related Links Matches: India v South Africa at Nagpur Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: India | South Africa #p#Match Facts March 12, Nagpur Start time 2.30pm (0900 GMT) #p#The Big Picture #p#India haven't lost a game yet but haven't escaped the darts from the critics. Why hasn't Harbhajan Singh taken wickets? Why Piyush Chawla? Why not R Ashwin? Why are the batsmen fumbling? Why do the fielders always fumble? Why is Zaheer Khan finding no support from other seamers? Why do they never bowl yorkers? #p#South Africa have lost one game but that loss threw up the same old question. Why do they choke? The two pre-tournament favourites face each other on a batting track where conventional wisdom would dictate that the team with better bowling and fielding should prevail. However, on their day, both teams are inherently strong enough to beat any logic. #p#Both teams have kept the team-sheet under wraps. Perhaps they really haven't yet decided. The news from the South African camp offers hints but there is nothing conclusive. Imran Tahir is a doubtful starter but he is not ruled out. AB de Villiers' back is better but it's not sure whether he will keep. If he keeps, Morne van Wyk might lose his spot and they may toy with bringing Lonwabo Tsotsobe in. Johan Botha might replace Tahir. And so it goes on. The logic is easy to understand: It's a batting pitch, so why not push AB to keep and play an extra bowler? If they hadn't choked against England, that decision would have been far easier to make. #p#India have their own puzzles to solve. MS Dhoni talked about going in with three seamers but he also said Ashwin might play. Barring Zaheer, India's seamers haven't really eased their captain's headaches. Sreesanth was poor in the first game, Munaf Patel has looked fine but there is no guarantee that he won't bleed runs if the batsmen take to him, and Ashish Nehra is yet to regain full fitness. Nehra was Dhoni's go-to man under pressure but suddenly, in the middle of a mundane home ODI series against New Zealand in November 2010, his form gave away and he is yet to recapture it. The Ashwin-Chawla debate has been analysed to death and it will be interesting to see what unfolds tomorrow. #p#Form guide (completed matches, most recent first) South Africa LWWWW India WWTWL #p#Watch out for... #p#Virender Sehwag has gone relatively quiet after the first game but he can be expected to fire on a big stage. He has been over-aggressive in a couple of games but against South Africa he is likely to return to his pre-tournament mood of trying to play as many overs as possible. #p#JP Duminy will be crucial for South Africa if they decide to go in with an extra bowler. In the recent few games, especially in the home series against India, he showed that he can shoulder the responsibility of leading the middle order. He might well be at the forefront when South Africa take their batting Powerplay and his battle against his nemesis Harbhajan could well be the key. #p#Team news How the teams arrive at the final playing XI will give us an insight into their state of mind. Will South Africa attack with an extra bowler? Will India play an extra spinner? #p#India (probable): 1 Virender Sehwag, 2 Sachin Tendulkar, 3 Gautam Gambhir, 4 Virat Kohli, 5 Yuvraj Singh, 6 MS Dhoni (wk/capt), 7 Yusuf Pathan, 8 Harbhajan Singh, 9 Zaheer Khan, 10 Ashish Nehra/Piyush Chawla/R Ashwin, 11 Munaf Patel #p#South Africa (possible): 1 Graeme Smith (capt), 2 Hashim Amla, 3 Jacques Kallis, 4 AB de Villiers (wk), 5 JP Duminy, 6 Faf du Plessis, 7 Morne van Wyk/ Johan Botha, 8 Robin Peterson, 9 Dale Steyn, 10 Morne Morkel, 11 Lonwabo Tsotsobe #p#Pitch and conditions As Graeme Smith said, they've been rolling it for four days. It will be hot and dry and dew is not expected to be a factor. Smith made it clear that the toss would have minimal effect. #p#Stats and trivia Imran Tahir is the only South African bowler to take four or more wickets twice in a World Cup game #p#Sachin Tendulkar has been out lbw 38 times in ODIs. Only Sanath Jayasuriya (47), and Inzamam-ul-Haq (39) have been dismissed more times. #p#Quotes "I don't think this is the be all and end all of the World Cup. This part is about qualifying and then going into the knockouts with some confidence. I hope it is another really good game for the World Cup.." Graeme Smith puts the game in perspective. #p#"If I have two bowlers who are giving 70 runs from 20 overs, I would be quite happy with them even if they don't take wickets because ultimately the pressure turns on the batsmen to score runs in today's format... Harbhajan is doing his job and if the batsmen are not willing to take risks, he is stopping the run-scoring opportunities and breaking the momentum." MS Dhoni backs his lead spinner.
29	505687	India v South Africa, Group B, World Cup 2011, Nagpur	Dhoni wants top-order to bat longer	Sharda Ugra in Nagpur	March 11, 2011	#p#For all the fuss around India's bowlers during this World Cup - normal service could well be resumed within 24 hours - there's another slightly underwritten set of numbers from its first four matches. These numbers come from the unlikeliest of sources: India's top order, from the prime batting positions in the short game, numbers one to three. #p#India may not have lost a game in this World Cup so far but its opening stands have read: 69, 46, 9, 69. Both Virender Sehwag and Sachin Tendulkar have scored hundreds in this Cup - Sehwag reminding Dhaka and the world that a 200 could come any time and Tendulkar following it up with a measured construction of an innings in Bangalore. Yet in the two 'gimme' games that followed - versus Ireland and Netherlands - neither of the openers nor the No. 3 Gautam Gambhir have built from reasonable starts and none of them have crossed 40. Between them, Tendulkar (38, 27), Sehwag (5, 39) and Gambhir (10, 28) have spent significant time at the crease, but have not gone on to dominate. #p#In a tournament that was supposed to be about big-hitting batsmen on wickets that were belters, outfields that were small and opposition that was tiny, these are underwhelming returns. MS Dhoni believes that it is the start from the trio that will enable India's explosive middle order a chance to play their A-game, which will be needed in what will be India's most revealing match of the World Cup so far: against South Africa in Nagpur. #p#In his pre-match pow-wow at the VCA stadium, Dhoni said the team was hoping its top order comes through in the rest of the competition: "If we have slightly longer partnerships at the top, the explosive power of our middle and lower-middle order can be used more in the positive way." Read as: if the top three get runs, then Virat Kohli, Yuvraj Singh, Dhoni and Yusuf Pathan will be able to do more than fire-fight like they did against Ireland and Netherlands. #p#MS Dhoni has said that bigger partnerships at the top would help India's cause AFP Enlarge #p#"If our openers can play as long as possible, it will be good for us... what we have seen is that if both Sachin and Viru get going, it gets very difficult to stop them," Dhoni said. And that gives India the launch pad with which to build those innings that will give their unthreatening attack enough to bowl with. He was quick to add that even though "we have not got very big [opening] partnerships" what was important, was "the way we have got the runs" #p#The struggle against the two Associate teams has given the batsmen who followed the chance to test themselves under pressure, but the top order now needs to give the team the legs to bat through the rest of the competition. #p#Dhoni said India's batting relied heavily on momentum. "So if we get off to a good start from either momentum point of view or time-period point of view, our lower order can really cash in." In a slightly roundabout way, he was referring to the importance of the top order doing something emphatic against the South Africans: either scoring at a rapid rate or occupying enough overs to give the hitters who follow a chance to crank straight into turbo mode. For the first time, Dhoni looked fatigued on the eve of a World Cup match day. His normally jutting-chin-square-shoulder self slouched over the mike, the tedium of fronting the press evident, even though his replies still came with the full range: from considerate detailing to cutting snub. #p#The batting, he believed, had gained much from its wobbly performance over four matches: India had set totals and it had chased. It had played on run-heavy wickets and then slow tracks. "We have got fair exposure as to what we may get in the coming games depending on the venue. The first four games have been good for us to get into the groove and be ready for the next leg of the tournament." #p#With India's quarter-final slot as good as assured, Dhoni said meeting slightly tougher opposition two games before the knockout was a blessing of sorts and gave the team the "liberty of having two extra games" on the side. We will see. #p#What the Indians need right now, is to get that elusive momentum going. There will be no better time for India's top order to jump-start it than against South Africa on Saturday.
29	505705	India v South Africa, Group B, World Cup 2011, Nagpur	Smith banks on aggressive bowling line-up	Firdose Moonda in Nagpur	March 11, 2011	#p#Graeme Smith may have anticipated walking into a wind tunnel for his pre-match press conference at the VCA Stadium. With Group B's headline clash, between South Africa and India, just a few hours away, the media conjured up a gale force of questions, many of them not about the upcoming game. It began as a breeze, with a few small chats about bowling options, got gustier once the line of questioning changed to mindset, and then the hurricane arrived. "This team usually arrive as favourites and end up being branded chokers, how do you stay sane?" #p#The reporter meant little malice, but it was just the type of question that had the possibility to annoy Smith. But he was stronger than that. The smile stayed on his face as he answered. "The sanity in the squad is keeping all the outside influences out," Smith said. "We've been able to put a decent perspective on things in the group." #p#It's the angle that Smith and his team are viewing things from that refused to allow him to be swayed by the sentiment that the loss against England has left them in crisis, not necessarily as far as qualifying for the knockouts goes, but mentally. Smith said that it has not. "I'd like to think that our confidence and strength within the group is more powerful than one result." #p#What that one result seems to have done is given the team the confidence to face the graves of all their past stumbles that the critics have dug up. "Our past is our past and we can't hide from it. There is no point in trying to hide from the perception [that we struggle under pressure], the current group of players have to challenge the perception." #p#Even if it means that until they win a major tournament, they will be challenging that perception every time they step onto a cricket field, it's something they are willing to do. The challenge starts again against India, who South Africa beat 3-2 in an ODI series at home before this World Cup, and at a venue where they have enjoyed success, albeit in a Test match, just a year ago. #p#Dale Steyn is one of the many wicket-taking options that Graeme Smith says South Africa have Getty Images Enlarge #p#"I think I've spent a month of my life in Nagpur now, so we know it pretty well," Smith joked before turning to the more serious matter of the value that familiarity of the opposition will add. Although the Indian ODI squad in South Africa was without Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir and Sachin Tendulkar, Smith feels that South Africa have seen enough of them to feel comfortable that they have adequate first-hand knowledge of India. "We know each other quite well having spent the whole summer playing against each other. It's going to be a wonderful occasion and we're looking forward to it." #p#The Indian batting line-up, in particular the three who missed the series in South Africa, will be drooling at the sight of the Nagpur pitch, devoid of grass and promising runs. What they have to come up against is a South African attack that has conceded less than 230 in all three outings in the tournament so far. Besides being disciplined, they've been dangerous and have bowled out all three sides they have come up against. "As a bowling unit, we've been very strong and our unpredictability stands us in good stead," Smith said. #p#It's the element of surprise that makes them so different to the seam-heavy attacks of the past and the fact that all bowlers are now wicket-takers that makes them a tricky attack to plan to. While Dhoni said he was happy for his bowlers to concede sparsely and not take wickets some of the time, Smith feels it's the attacking intent which has proved a good form of defence for them. "We feel it's the best way to curb run-rate and to control the game. We've got a lot of wicket-taking options in our line-up, which is what we wanted." #p#With legspinner Imran Tahir a doubtful starter, South Africa may bring back left-armer Lonwabo Tsotsobe, who has not played a game in the tournament yet. He was the leading wicket-taker in the series against India, with 13 scalps and in batsmen-friendly conditions, the extra seamer could be a better option than the extra batsman. #p#With the bowling options appearing limitless, and the batting strong, South Africa seem to have few worries ahead of the big match. Smith wasn't allowed to breathe in the fresh air outside the media cauldron, or even just a sigh of relief, before being asked about his own nemesis, Zaheer Khan, who has the better of him in five out of 13 ODIs. "He is a quality bowler but I have worked on a few things with Duncan [Fletcher] and hopefully it will pay off."
29	505745	India v South Africa, Group B, World Cup 2011, Nagpur	Can India peak at the right time?	Sharda Ugra in Nagpur	March 12, 2011	Yuvraj Singh's performances have been one of the few high points in India's World Cup campaign so far Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: MS Dhoni | Yuvraj Singh Matches: India v South Africa at Nagpur Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: India | South Africa #p#What is to be made of India's World Cup so far? Is it about a stuttering four-match performance or rather the prelude to what will be a thoughtfully timed assault on the tougher stages of the competition? Is the very idea expectation or just an excuse? #p#Australia are the only other side who have not lost a game in this World Cup, so MS Dhoni's men are at least getting the results right. After raining runs in Dhaka, though, India's performance against England further dented their bowling's already dented reputation, and the batting was made to look all too mortal against the Associates. Results or not, the loudest favourite for the World Cup have been unable to do what champions are expected to - dominate chunks of play, send out a message, create an aura. #p#Many believe, and the idea is endorsed by Dhoni, that during this stage of a long event what India is looking for is not a full display of their talent but "momentum", "intensity", and "improvement" So that when the knock-out games arrive, the team can crank it up together. It is why India are playing like this through the tournament. They don't want to "peak too early", they are playing "within" themselves, they are saving it all up for the big matches against the big teams. #p#On Saturday in Nagpur, India's World Cup theory will have to come closer to establishing its truth versus South Africa, a big team, a big game. The outcome may determine little other than where the two teams may finish in their group but the quality of the cricket by both teams will reveal more than mere words about peaking can. Dhoni said on Friday that India's last two tough league games was the right build-up heading into the knockout stages of the competition. "You want to get a bit of momentum on your side - even though it's a fresh start every day, slowly the intensity will go up. You have to be at your best right from now on." #p#At every stage Dhoni has believed that India's best form is going to coincide with the second half of the Cup. At every stage he defends his men and explains how an unconvincing performance on the outside actually plays its part inside the larger plan. That for everything negative that may be written or hollered about over television, the team finds and feeds off a "positive" #p#That India's uneven batting performances may be of benefit because India have worked through all their options, chasing and defending, on flat tracks and slow, low turners. That average starts by the top three in three of the four games have meant the middle-order hitters have gotten a workout under pressure. #p#That running between wickets can be explained because India's best players rarely played together last year due to injuries. That the fielding wasn't going to get better, but at least they didn't drop catches. That squeezing the runs out in ODIs was equal to taking wickets because it lured batsmen into errors and increased the confidence of the bowlers. #p#It can be a reassuring argument because it keeps the team's confidence bubbling, observers respectfully daunted by the unforeseen, and the fans' dreams alive. History proves that peaking in long competitions may be unpredictable, but it happens far too often in sport to ignore: in the 1982 football World Cup, a luminous Brazil were knocked out and the Italians, who had squeaked through the league stage, won the title. Last year eventual champions Spain lost to Switzerland in their group game. In tennis' Grand Slam events, leading players often begin rusty and below par, raising their games in a fifth deciding set and then producing their best in the last few rounds. Cricket has Pakistan in 1992, Australia in 1999. Champions seem to instinctively know when to keep something in reserve and when to uncork it. #p#Yet to believe that the Indian team would not be looking for "form" or "touch" in the World Cup event is to believe that form does not exist. As the World Cup has trundled on, the Indians looking for form are many, but those visibly finding it on the field over the last few games, are few. Teams do not have a switch that can be thrown when it is time to peak. Dhoni said he judges his team's progress through a few signs: on-field performance and intensity. "Intensity really matters. It's about body language, the way with which you are fielding, the amount of effort you are putting into it, how are you are actually helping each other." He said he had seen the signs in his team. "Hopefully as the tournament progress we should be improving a lot over a period of time." #p#India has demonstrated both on-field performances and intensity only in patches: a few partnerships, Yuvraj Singh's presence, Yusuf Pathan's late assault over Ireland, and the sudden spurt in the field, only after Zaheer Khan removed Ian Bell and Andrew Strauss, to break England's methodical run-chase in Bangalore. #p#Identifying a cricket team heading towards a timely peak is hard, however. Athletes and swimmers can carefully calibrate how to do so through training and by using the stopwatch. Teams are totally different beasts, distinct individual skills interlocked in collective pursuit; cricket particularly so. For this complicated choreography to come together at the same time, for teams to peak, says Heath Matthews, "it boils down to team dynamic and the internal ethos." #p#As the World Cup has trundled on, the Indians looking for form are many, but those visibly finding it on the field over the last few games, are few. Teams do not have a switch that can be thrown when it is time to peak #p#The sports performance director at the Centre for Sports Medicine in Mumbai's KD Ambani Hospital, Matthews has worked with teams and athletes in both South Africa and India. In team sports, he says, it is the senior players who dictate the dynamic, through form and from it to morale and belief. In a long event like the World Cup, "when the seniors absorb the pressure and the expectation, it frees up the younger players, energises them, helps them make key plays that can affect matches." #p#It is what Zaheer's bowling could do to the rest of his tribe, how Yuvraj's form could work for Virat Kohli or that of the openers for Gautam Gambhir. For a team collective to peak, a number of central figures in the side, like its senior leaders, need to peak at the same time. Like Imran Khan did at the 1992 World Cup through leadership that unlocked Inzamam ul Haq, or the Ranatunga-De Silva duo in 1996, or Shane Warne in 1999. It may be what Dhoni is trying to do, by giving Piyush Chawla his support. #p#Matthews, a South African himself, says Saturday's match gives India a chance to "check the levels of their intensity" It works the same way on the other side of the fence too. South Africa also wants to hit the right tempo, captain Graeme Smith saying on Friday that a formula was yet to be found. "Everyone in sport is trying to work out what the right method is. Some teams seem to get it right - who knows what the reason is?" #p#The length of the World Cup has made finding the right answers even more difficult. The South Africans have spent more than a month in India and played only three games, a schedule Smith called, "weird" So far, he said, it had been, "a bit of a stop-start for us with the long breaks" The sudden clutch of South Africa's three matches over 11 days would actually help. "Hopefully we qualify well for the quarter-finals and then we are ready to go." He means take off. #p#What both India and South Africa want to control now is momentum, which will help them hit the peak when they most need to. In physics, momentum is mass times velocity. In this World Cup, it means the weight of performance that will set in motion a force that even the most immovable objects in cricket cannot stop. In this World Cup, only one team will ever have it, only one team will ever peak.
29	505755	India v South Africa, Group B, World Cup 2011, Nagpur	Bowling depth gives South Africa options	Firdose Moonda in Nagpur	March 12, 2011	Imran Tahir is South Africa's leading wicket-taker in the World Cup Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: Johan Botha | Imran Tahir | Robin Peterson Matches: India v South Africa at Nagpur Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: South Africa #p#Johan Botha and Robin Peterson and have always been very handy cards to have in South Africa's pocket. They typically perform the holding role, controlling the mid-sections of an innings and taking wickets when needed. Both can also bat a bit. Usually though, only one of them has played at a time and most of the time that has been Botha. They tended not to operate as a pair, one being a left-arm spinner and one an offspinner. #p#Then the joker came along in the form of Imran Tahir, and suddenly the spinners formed a complete pack. Tahir did for them what the right colour scarf does for someone's eyes. Peterson and Botha, already good spinners in their own right, somehow seemed to be spurred on by his presence, and their own wicket-taking abilities grew. Tahir has emerged as the leader and those who follow him, including the part timers, JP Duminy and Faf du Plessis, have been able to bowl around him with much more success than South Africa has ever had with spinners before. #p#The reality, however, is that the joker has to disappear for ten days and there is a very, real possibility that those ten days have already started, and that he will not feature in the game against India. The challenge for the other spinners, and the bowling attack as a whole, will therefore be to make sure their house of cards doesn't collapse in his absence. Much will depend on the combinations that are selected for the two matches that Tahir does not play in. It's unlikely that anyone can replace him as the joker but the king, queen and jack have to be able to devise a plan to make up for what South Africa will lose by not having him. #p#"Now that Imran is out for ten days, they will more than likely play both Johan Botha and Robin Peterson," Paul Adams, the former South Africa left-arm spinner, told ESPNCricinfo. It would mean a confidence-boosting recall for Botha, who was left out of the last two matches, after opening the bowling against the West Indies. Before Tahir arrived, Botha was South Africa's premier limited-overs spinner and although he was never as attacking as Tahir, he brought his own brand of aggression. #p#His chief role, as Graeme Smith once outlined, was to control the middle of an innings. It was something Botha had made his own and it has worked for him since South Africa beat Australia in home and away series in the 2008/9 season. At times, it may have been formulaic, with most opposition knowing when to expect Botha to come on, knowing that they would have to work harder for their runs in that period and knowing that he may snag a couple of wickets, but it was a formula that worked. #p#Botha's job changed with the opening act of South Africa's World Cup, when he was made to open the bowling. "Botha was used because of number of left-handers in the West Indies team," Adams said. "It's a sign that South Africa are selecting their attack according to who they are playing." It's that specific selection for the opposition that resulted in Botha missing out on the last two matches, if the logic follows, and because South Africa needed an extra batsman and a backup wicket-keeper, Morne van Wyk, both times. Botha is widely regarded as South Africa's captain-elect, but the new thinking means that not even the man next in line for the throne is assured of a spot in the starting eleven. #p#Peterson's journey has not been as clear cut as Botha's. Usually a fringe player in the side, having been around for almost nine years and only playing in 43 ODIs, his critics believed his job was more to carry drinks than responsibility. In this World Cup, however, he has not only pressed the mute button on them but thrown the remote control away, featuring in all three games and been given the most strategic job of the competition so far - opening the bowling against England. Peterson was the most important part of Smith's trap that was set up for Kevin Pietersen. The plan worked in more than ways than one and at the end of his first spell, Peterson had figures that read 4-2-4-3. #p#In the games against West Indies and England, it was Tahir who was the highest wicket-taker with four scalps, usually getting a crucial breakthrough in the middle order and then helping to mop up the tail. "Imran has been used particularly to strike at different stages of the game, in the powerplays and at the back end when the batsmen are wanting to more attacking. With his variation and difficulty to read, he becomes more effective in taking wickets then," Adams said. Without that, the striking job has to be done by someone else. #p#This is where the bowlers that have gone unnoticed at this tournament may come back into play in a big way. The quicks, Dale Steyn and Morne Morkel, who have been outshone by the spinners, have an opportunity to show they are still here, on a surface that should favour them, especially Steyn and his reverse swing. It could even open the door for Lonwabo Tsotsobe, who was the leading wicket-taker in the home series against India over the summer, and who has yet to have a run in this tournament. #p#It could well be a case of normal service resuming for the South African attack in Nagpur - with the seam bowlers opening and looking to create early breakthroughs. "Robbie also brings a wicket-taking option in those middle overs," Adams said, a statement that illustrates that the spinners may be back to the task of controlling the innings from a certain point. It will again, have to be carefully thought out, but being the usual way that they go about things, it may not seem so. With the number of options South Africa have it's something that speaks about the strength of their attack that that they can "build a specific plan with each game they play."

India's defeat means they aren't yet entirely certain of making the last eight, though they should still make it barring a miracle. There's a small chance of their being eliminated if the following results happen: England beat West Indies, who in turn beat India; Bangladesh win both their remaining games, while South Africa beat Ireland. In such a scenario, South Africa, Bangladesh and West Indies will be ahead of India on points, while England will be level with them. That'll bring net run rates into play, and it's here that India have a reasonably comfortable cushion - their NRR of 0.768 is well ahead of England's 0.013. India will have to lose their match by about 95 runs, and England will have to win by about the same margin for their run rate to move ahead of India's. For South Africa, the win has considerably eased the pressure on them. A defeat would have left them with two must-win games - including a potentially tricky one against Bangladesh in Mirpur - but this result against India means they'll have to mess it up really badly from here to not make it to the quarter-finals. All they need is a win in either of their last two games, against Ireland and Bangladesh. #p#<m37>Things got tighter in the 43rd over when Harbhajan slipped a quick delivery down the leg side, past the advancing Duminy, and though Dhoni fumbled the take, he recovered to finish the stumping.</m37> <m38>India tightened the screws further when Munaf Patel trapped Morne van Wyk lbw in the 44th over</m38>, <m39>just moments after Gambhir dropped van Wyk at deep midwicket</m39>. #p#<m40>In the 48th over, Botha swiped Munaf through midwicket and crashed a six over the straight boundary to push South Africa ahead</m40> <m41>but fell off the next ball, miscuing a slower one over cover where Suresh Raina, the substitute fielder, took a tough catch.</m41> <m42>Zaheer gave away just four runs in the 49th over</m42> but <m43>Petersen settled the issue in the final one.</m43> #p#India lost the game in a manic self-destructive display in <m44>the batting Powerplay</m44> that <m45>they took in the 39th over</m45>. <m46>India were strolling at 253 for 1</m46> but <m47>lost four wickets for 30 runs in the Powerplay</m47> and <m48>their last nine for 29 to collapse to 296</m48>. #p#In a sweet moment of redemption, it was the pair of Dale Steyn and Morne Morkel, who bled runs with the new ball, who did the damage during this manic phase. <m49>Sachin Tendulkar fell to an across-the-line hoick, his first ugly shot of the day, in the 40th over to Morne Morkel.</m49> <m50>Steyn had a double strike in the next over: Gambhir backed outside leg and scooped a slower one to mid-off</m50> and <m51>Yusuf Pathan blasted to cover</m51>. Things got worse <m52>when Yuvraj Singh swung a full toss to long-on off the final delivery of the Powerplay</m52>, and <m53>it turned chaotic when Virat Kohli gave a tame return catch to Peterson</m53>. In the space of a few minutes, the game had spiraled out of India's control and returned to balance. <m54>Steyn even went on to complete a five-for</m54>, something that was scarcely believable when he was leaking runs with the new ball, when he cleaned up the tail. #p#Until that stunning phase of play, it was all India. Until then, even 375 seemed a possibility. If Virender Sehwag pumped in the adrenalin, Tendulkar oozed class. There was not a single shot that looked risky and yet he played all the shots, even a hooked six, a shot that he doesn't play too often these days. <m55>Tendulkar faced just 20 balls in the first ten overs but had raced away to 35</m55>, and <m56>his fifty came off 33 balls.</m56> <m57>It was in the eighth over, from Morkel, that he really got going with an awesome thump through the covers, which was followed by a gorgeous straight drive.</m57> Like always, he held his pose even as Morkel was down on the mat. It was a moment that perfectly caught the one-sided battle. #p#<m58>When Steyn fired a bouncer in the 10th over, Tendulkar unfurled a stylish hook to deposit it beyond the backward square-leg boundary.</m58> <m59>When Jacques Kallis bowled a slower one, Tendulkar glided forward and across to whip the off cutter past mid-on.</m59> Unlike Sehwag, who kept backing away to the leg to try hit everything to the off, <m60>and fell in the process</m60>, Tendulkar played the spinners as per the demands of the ball but of course on his own terms. <m61>It should have been his night but cruelly it was his shot that triggered a stunning implosion</m61>, which proved the difference in the end. #p#Match Timeline

Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Matches: India v South Africa at Nagpur Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: India | South Africa #p#Potential handover of the day #p#It was at least an hour before they had to put their boxing gloves on when Gary Kirsten, in red and blue, and Corrie van Zyl, in green and white, led their squads on to the field for the warm ups. Before they got down to business, the pair met in the middle to exchange pleasantries. Rather than just a quick handshake the two chatted for a brief moment, perhaps with van Zyl adding the words: "This lot are yours after this," to Kirsten. Both will step down from their respective positions after the tournament with Kirsten the favourite to take over as South Africa coach. #p#Kamran Akmal moment of the day #p#It would have been a dream start for South Africa: Virender Sehwag out in the second over for four. <m1>It could have been a reality when the India opener edged a Morne Morkel delivery. The ball flew to wicketkeeper Morne van Wyk's right, but the gloveman did not even flinch. He may not have seen it at all, because he made no attempt to get to it. Graeme Smith, at first slip, rightly thought it was van Wyk's catch and didn't make any attempt of his own</m1>, leaving the whole incident looking remarkably similar to the moment when Ross Taylor's edge was allowed to fly between Kamran Akmal and Younis Khan in Pallekele. The cost that time was 131 runs. This time, <m2>it was 69 more runs from Sehwag's bat</m2> <m3>before he was dismissed</m3>. #p#The first for Faf #p#With no Imran Tahir to turn to, <m4>Graeme Smith tossed the ball to Francois du Plessis, his part time legspinner. He filled in Tahir's suddenly big boots very quickly, with a wicket in his first over.</m4> And who and how. <m5>A rampaging Sehwag was bowled by du Plessis, who fired one in and got the batsman to edge onto leg stump.</m5> <m6>A 142-run partnership that looked like it had knocked all the air out of South Africa was broken</m6>. Surely now, he doesn't deserve the nickname Faf - a colloquial verb for hanging around doing nothing. No faffing around for him, now. #p#The no-ball #p#After 787 legal deliveries in the tournament, spanning just over three matches, <m7>South Africa bowled their first no-ball in the fourth over. Morne Morkel, who has had a history of no-ball problems in the past, overstepped while bowling to Sachin Tendulkar. The ball was angled towards third man, destined for four before Kallis cut it off on the boundary.</m7> <m8>The resultant free hit only cost an extra one.</m8> #p#The moment of deluge #p#It wasn't <m9>Tendulkar's wicket</m9> or <m10>the fall of Gautam Gambhir</m10>, or <m11>even Yusuf Pathan</m11> that gave the glimpse of <m12>India's 9 for 29 impending doom</m12>. It was when <m13>Yuvraj Singh, the team's Cup crisis man, went</m13> that the alarm bells began to ring. <m14>A meaty six off Johan Botha promised much</m14>, but <m15>an over later a full toss from Jacques Kallis was clumsily holed into Botha's hands down the ground.</m15> <m16>Within 16 runs, India had lost four wickets.</m16> Oops, cometh the choke. #p#The grand-daddy of the field #p#India's fielding has come under fierce criticism for not being as agile or as eager as other teams but there was a general improvement in this match. Although we saw Harbhajan Singh and Ashish Nehra put their bodies on the line it was the man with the oldest legs on the field, Sachin Tendulkar, whose fielding display really caught the eye. Tendulkar was a sharp and accurate and even when it looked like he would be beaten, he wasn't. <m17>With Jacques Kallis playing the reverse-sweep off Harbhajan, Tendulkar was beaten at short third man twice</m17> but <m18>the third time he got down and made sure he only gave away one.</m18> #p#The 2.5 metre jinx #p#No matter what MS Dhoni does, he can't escape the DRS system and its 2.5 metre rule. <m19>The first referral India asked for in this match was an lbw appeal that Zaheer Khan had against Jacques Kallis. The on-field call was not out but replays showed that the ball pitched in line and would have gone on to hit off stump. But the catch? Kallis was more than 2.5 metres in front of the stumps at the point of impact and that meant that the ball had to be hitting some part of middle in order for him to be out. The on-field call was upheld and Dhoni's bugbear bit him again.</m19>
29	505890	India v South Africa, Group B, World Cup 2011, Nagpur	A dramatic collapse and other records	Madhusudhan Ramakrishnan	March 12, 2011	South Africa's steady progress was in sharp contrast to India's aggressive start and rapid collapse. ESPNcricinfo Ltd Enlarge Related Links Report : South Africa prevail in the battle of nerves. Matches: India v South Africa at Nagpur Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: India | South Africa #p#In a tense finish, <m1>South Africa held their nerve to win by three wickets</m1> on a pitch that got a lot slower as the game went on. South Africa paced their innings superbly, maintaining a required run-rate of close to eight. <m2>With 13 runs required off the final over, MS Dhoni opted to go with Ashish Nehra.</m2> <m3>Robin Peterson hit two fours and a six to give South Africa a nail-biting win.</m3> #p#Perhaps, the most notable feature of the match was the contrast in batting approach of both the teams. While <m4>India started in an extremely aggressive manner and reached 87 for 0 in the first ten overs</m4>, <m5>South Africa were far more sedate, scoring just 43 for 1 in the same period.</m5> <m6>India continued to score quickly, reaching 267 in the 40th over</m6> before <m7>Tendulkar was dismissed</m7>. <m8>South Africa, despite scoring at a much lower rate, kept pace with the required run rate and reached the 200-run mark in the 39th over.</m8> However, <m9>in the last ten overs, India suffered a collapse losing nine wickets for 29 runs</m9>. The worm for the Indian innings clearly shows the clutter of wickets at the end which <m10>kept the score down to 296</m10>, a far more achievable target. South Africa though, maintained wickets in hand throughout and this proved most crucial as <m11>they got past the line with two balls to spare</m11>. The table below shows how the teams were placed at various stages of the innings. #p#India and South Africa at various stages of the innings Team Overa 1-10 Overs 11-20 Overs 21-30 Overs 31-40 Overs 41-50 India 87/0 68/1 42/0 71/1 28/8 South Africa 43/1 46/0 55/1 74/1 82/4 #p#In India's innings, <m12>Dale Steyn's spell of 5 for 50</m12> <m13>kept the score down to 296</m13> after 370 looked possible at one point. <m14>Zaheer Khan responded well in the second innings, conceding just 43 runs in his ten overs and bowling 35 dot balls in the process.</m14> However, the rest of the bowlers conceded more than six runs per over which proved critical in the end. #p#Quite a few batting records were set in a high-scoring game, and are listed below. #p#Opening pair comes good. <m15>Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag, one of the most successful opening pairs</m15> in ODIs, had previously aggregated just 54 runs in five matches against South Africa. <m16>Their 142-run stand in this match</m16> is the third-highest opening partnership for India in World Cups and the second-highest for this pair behind the 153 against Sri Lanka in Johannesburg in 2003. Tendulkar has been involved in three of the five century opening stands for India in World Cups. #p#Electric start. <m17>At the end of ten overs, India had reached 87 without loss.</m17> This is the highest score in the first ten overs in the 2011 World Cup. The previous best was the 82 scored by India against Netherlands in Delhi. In World Cup matches since 1999, the most runs scored in the first ten overs is 119, by West Indies against Canada in the 2003 World Cup. The highest for India in the same period is 88 against Pakistan in 2003. #p#Top three make fifty-plus scores. <m18>With Sehwag, Tendulkar and Gautam Gambhir scoring over 50</m18>, the match became only the third instance of the top three batsmen scoring over fifty in an innings in a World Cup match. The previous two occasions came in the 1975 World Cup. #p#India's incredible collapse. <m19>After the second wicket fell with the score on 267</m19>, <m20>India lost their last eight wickets for 29 runs</m20> <m21>collapsing to 296 all out</m21>. There have been only three occasions in ODIs when teams have lost their last eight wickets for less than 29 runs. The lowest is 17 runs, by Zimbabwe against Sri Lanka in 2004. #p#Tendulkar adds to impressive numbers. <m22>Tendulkar scored his sixth century</m22> and his 19th fifty-plus score in World Cups, both records for any player in World Cups. He also became the first player to score 2000 runs in ODIs against South Africa. #p#Smith's woes against Zaheer continue. <m23>Graeme Smith was dismissed by Zaheer for the sixth time</m23> in ODIs to add to his six dismissals in Tests. He has now been dismissed 13 times by Zaheer overall (including Twenty-20 internationals). James Anderson is next, having dismissed Smith eight times overall. #p#Other key stats from the game: #p#<m24>Dale Steyn's 5 for 50</m24> is his best bowling performance in ODIs and <m25>the sixth five-wicket haul by a South African bowler in World Cups</m25>. The target of 297 is the highest successfully chased score by South Africa in a World Cup game. Their previous best of 253 also came against India in the 1999 World Cup. <m26>Tendulkar's century</m26> was his 13th in an ODI defeat, the most for any player. He is followed by Chris Gayle, who has nine centuries in defeats. <m27>The 52 runs scored by South Africa in their batting Powerplay</m27> is their second-highest in the tournament. The highest by any team is 70, by Pakistan against Kenya. This is the fourth occasion that a team winning the toss in a day-night match in Nagpur has gone on to <m28>lose the game</m28>.

AFP Enlarge Related Links Report : South Africa prevail in the battle of nerves. Players/Officials: MS Dhoni | Graeme Smith Matches: India v South Africa at Nagpur Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: India | South Africa #p#It could be a moment that decides a match, sometimes a collection of moments, whether they follow in sequence or not. This time, it was two five-over long phases that made the difference - the two batting Powerplays that undid India and redid South Africa and <m3>in the end conspired to produce the result</m3>. #p#The batting Powerplay has proved a puzzle for most teams, not knowing whether to take it when the going is good and they have a chance at acceleration or when they are being bogged down and need to find a way out. South Africa used it in a situation similar to the latter, when they needed to wrestle the match away. <m4>It was at the start of the 37th over of their chase and the difference between runs required and balls remaining was 40, and the required rate was almost nine runs to the over.</m4> #p#To allow the chase to get further away from them would have left too much ground to be made up later on. Even though <m5>India had just run Jacques Kallis out</m5> and the pendulum and swung back in their favour, South Africa decided it was time to tussle for the advantage. It required careful calculation but they judged it well, after analysing their own batting and the bowling options that India had left at their disposal. #p#The middle order after JP Duminy is relatively untested, with Faf du Plessis, Morne van Wyk, Johan Botha and Robin Peterson only playing a role in the disastrous chase in Chennai last Sunday. de Villiers and Duminy were the last experienced pair and Graeme Smith decided they would be best placed to take advantage of the fact that Zaheer Khan was almost bowled out. "We had discussed it tactically and we knew that Zaheer had been their best bowler in the Powerplays. After he bowled his two in the middle, we thought it was a good time to take it and it worked out well," Smith said. #p#<m6>Zaheer was used for two of the Powerplay overs</m6> but <m7>South Africa still managed to score 52 runs for the loss of just de Villiers in that period.</m7> <m8>They brought the required rate down to eight by the end of the 41st over.</m8> It was a combination of luck, with <m9>de Villiers inside-edging for four in the first over</m9>, and aggressive intent, with Duminy, new at the crease, but aware of what he needed to do and able to pick the lines and lengths fluently. #p#<m10>When the Poweplay ended,</m10> Duminy had to escort the lower middle order through to the end. <m11>He ended up perishing in the cause</m11> but du Plessis and Botha were able to handle it on their own. It's likely they wouldn't have been able to if it wasn't for the work done in <m12>the Powerplay,</m12>. It's also unlikely that the chase would have been on if it wasn't for damage South Africa's bowlers did during <m13>the India's batting Powerplay</m13>. #p#<m14>India were cruising on 253 for 1</m14>, <m15>Sachin Tendulkar and Gautam Gambhir were both comfortable and starting to build a mountain for South Africa to climb</m15>. In anticipation of that Everest, India were determined to get to the summit as quickly as possible and decided to use <m16>the Powerplay</m16> as their cable car to the top. "Often in Powerplays, you look to get a par-plus score," MS Dhoni said. He explained that India were hoping to add some bonus runs in that period, especially because they had wickets in hand, and it ended up having the opposite effect. "You look for those extra 25-30 runs and then you end up 40 runs short." #p#India's desperation in <m17>the Powerplay</m17> was evident, with <m18>Gambhir's urgency to return for a second run off the second ball Dale Steyn bowled; it would have had Tendulkar run out if there was a direct hit.</m18> <m19>He managed back-to-back boundaries off Morne Morkel</m19> but <m20>when Tendulkar attempted the same, he was dismissed</m20>. Steyn used the slower ball well and Kallis the full ball - each time they asked a question of the India batsmen, the answer was one of them holing out. <m21>Yusuf Pathan and Yuvraj Singh gave their wickets away</m21> and <m22>in total India's Powerplay resulted in a score of 30 for 4</m22>. #p#<m23>That was all part of their grander collapse, 29 for 9</m23>, <m24>with five of those wickets going Steyn's way</m24>. The domino effect started with what happened in <m25>the Powerplay</m25> and instead of India aiming to regroup after that, they persisted in their pursuit of glory and crashed. "<m26>The Powerplay</m26> was the turning point," Dhoni admitted. #p#What may get overlooked is why India wanted to lash out in <m27>the Powerplay</m27> the way they did. They had been frustrated from after the first drinks break, because of a special spell by recalled offspinner Botha. With <m28>the score on 137 for 1 after 16 overs</m28>, the situation could so easily have got out of hand and the bushfire India had started could have burnt the entire forest down. #p#It was time for Botha, the senior spinner, the man who has been credited with being able to steer a cricket match in the direction he wants it to go, and he got into the driver's seat immediately. <m29>He should have had a wicket in his first over when Virender Sehwag was dropped by van Wyk</m29>. In the 15-over period where he bowled with Peterson, du Plessis, Steyn and Kallis at the other end, 66 runs were conceded. #p#It was a deliberate effort by Smith to create the situation where Botha could do that. "I didn't want to expose the two frontline spinners in <m30>the Powerplay</m30> because I wanted him [Botha] to control the middle overs. He bowled well in that period for us when we were getting taken to the cleaners." Botha did not feature in the Powerplays, but his performance around them was enough to script what would happen in <m31>that five-over phase where South Africa won the game</m31>.
29	505901	India v South Africa, Group B, World Cup 2011, Nagpur	Smith hails South Africa's determination	Firdose Moonda in Nagpur	March 12, 2011	#p#Five years ago, to the day, South Africa successfully chased 434 to beat Australia at the Wanderers. It was a historic win, featuring the highest run-chase in ODI cricket. It was a day to remember and when Graeme Smith was in the field against India on Saturday afternoon in Nagpur, memories of that game came back to him for all the wrong reasons. #p#"On the bus this morning the team manager said to me it was the anniversary of the 438 game and at one stage I was having nightmares about chasing that," Smith said. <m1>Virender Sehwag and Sachin Tendulkar were doing to the South African attack worse</m1> than what Adam Gilchrist and Simon Katich did that day in 2006. <m2>After 15 overs of that match, Australia were 96 without loss. India reached that point after 11.2 overs and they showed no signs of stopping.</m2> #p#While South Africa had a stunned home crowd to deal with in Johannesburg, in Nagpur they had a boisterous Indian crowd, spurring on every run. "We were on the backend of a massive beating," Smith said. "The noise out there was really intense." Control was slipping from Smith's hands and he didn't know what to do to rein in the run flow. Two overs later, he did the only thing he thought might work and called for a time out. #p#<m3>Robin Peterson had an lbw appeal against Sachin Tendulkar, which was clearly missing leg, but Smith asked for the review, not because he thought it was out, but because he felt the team needed a break.</m3> "It was really to bring the guys in together. <m4>The way Sachin and Viru were playing</m4>, it was difficult to connect and regroup." #p#The South African middle order stepped up at the right time. Associated Press Enlarge #p#The team got into a huddle immediately and Smith began instructing. "I said to them: let's show some composure and focus our heads and maybe we can make up the 30-40 runs extra that we've given away." For the next 15 balls little changed but then the tide started turning. Johan Botha's ability to turn the game around was on display, and even though the wickets didn't come for at least another 20 overs the advantage began shifting. #p#In the end, Smith was pleased to report that South Africa felt as though they had "beat our targets by miles," during the innings break. <m5>Dale Steyn, Man of the Match for his 5 for 50</m5>, said that after the blitzkrieg South Africa would have been happy with keeping India to 340. "They kept putting up those projected scores and I kept thinking what is going on here," he said. #p#Steyn has had a particularly successful run in Nagpur, where he took 7 for 51 in a Test match last year and engineered the Indian collapse during <m6>the batting Powerplay</m6> on Saturday. Smith said the way his bowlers "just hung in there and pounced at the end," was what pleased him the most about their effort in the field. #p#There may have been some thoughts of South Africa being on too much of a high after their stunning comeback with the ball to focus on their task with the bat, but Smith said the positive vibes pushed them on. "We were on a bit of a momentum shift. We spoke a lot about partnerships and how we wanted to play." #p#Although the pitch was "not as free-flowing" as the Indian opening pair had made it look, South Africa stuck to the task. <m7>Jacques Kallis and Hashim Amla laid the foundation</m7>, before AB de Villiers put the team on track to get over the line. Still, the untested middle order had to play their part and Smith was glad that their role ended up being vital. "This is massive for them and they would have gained a lot of confidence from this." #p#It ended up not being as difficult a task as the 434 they had to hunt down five years ago, but the conditions in Nagpur were tough to deal with. Smith said South Africa were careful not to be overawed and wanted to start building a legacy of being competitive in big games and pressure situations. "So many people talk about the privilege of playing in India and it is a privilege. But I also told the team that this is where a team of our quality deserves to play. We wanted to earn respect today and we did that with the way we played and the way we came back."

Getty Images Enlarge Related Links News : MS Dhoni hits out at batsmen. Report : South Africa prevail in the battle of nerves. Players/Officials: MS Dhoni | Dale Steyn Matches: India v South Africa at Nagpur Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: India #p#Imagine that India's World Cup campaign is an upside-down cake. What else could you say about their cricket in Nagpur on Saturday, other than it overturned? #p#All that had seemed to work so far in their previous four group games - solidity in the middle order, the ability to calculate risks and plan innings - fell apart. #p#All that had regularly fallen apart or just imploded - the threat of the bowlers, the zest of the fielders - was suddenly looking the real deal. #p#Any respectable baker knows that if the recipe of the upside-down cake is not followed to utter precision, if the temperature is not absolutely spot on, that cake will not respond like normal ones and become stodgy, or just not rise and turn into porridge. That cake and its best parts will end up burnt and bitter. In Nagpur on Saturday, India failed to be precise, they heated themselves at the wrong time and were well and truly burnt. <m2>Defeat at the hands of South Africa by three wickets in Nagpur</m2>. Their dinner will taste of ashes. #p#The match was what it was meant to be: a contest between the World Cup's two strongest contenders who had just spent the better part of the southern hemisphere summer banging heads. When they met again in Nagpur, in India's biggest game of this World Cup so far, the head-banging continued. It was a riveting contest, filled with incident, individuals falling and rising within the space of a few overs, teams rising and falling and rising within hours. #p#Beaten by England when they should have won, triumphant in Nagpur when they could have lost, South Africa have risen. India, who have talked about raising their tempo, finding their rhythm, gaining momentum, <m3>have fallen</m3>. They were tripped not by the familiar frailties that had come up against the weaker teams, but against a newer, more threatening anxiety. That when India are up against one of the best and most varied bowling attacks in the World Cup, their strongest suit could suddenly go shabby. #p#<m4>Nine for 29</m4> are not numbers that the Indians will be allowed to forget for the rest of this campaign. <m5>Captain MS Dhoni, frozen and furious on the other end for more than half an hour of his 12 not out</m5>, will never want to remember it. <m6>Nine for 29</m6> is a coded message sent out by the Indian batsmen to all other frontline teams in the World Cup to take a close look at India's flaws. That the fortress could be breached. #p#The real irony is that India's batsmen were not bombed out by the short ball; Morne Morkel had to be taken off after seven overs, <m7>Dale Steyn's first spell went for 24 off three</m7>. <m8>After his seventh over he had conceded 46.</m8> Yet it is how <m9>he finished his overs - 5 for 50</m9> that counted. <m10>His wicket-taking spell - 16 balls, four runs, five wickets</m10> - reads so implausible that the only time Steyn could possibly repeat it is if he was asked to bowl to Canada Under-19s. Steyn on the scent can in any case be a menace on two legs. Steyn in that mood, bowling to batsmen whose calculation and planning has melted into mush, becomes what Nagpur was. The theatre of the absurd. Those lovely idioms about well begun being half done have never been more untrue at the hands of the Indian batting, which began exceptionally well but ended up in a heap. #p#The aftershock of <m11>the nine for 29</m11> will erase the memory of few aspects of India's game that were actually good today. The impact of one repeatedly annihilated the memory of the other. <m12>The two century stands between Tendulkar (whose 99th international 100 is already buried under the rubble) and Sehwag</m12> and <m13>then Tendulkar and Gambhir</m13> had the audience and the team dreaming of 370. After being indistinct in the first few games, the top three had batted like top three must and did what they were meant to do. They had gobbled up the overs and sent the run-rate into orbit. What they had done, unintentionally of course, was make those that followed them assume that the rest was going to be easy. #p#The South African bowlers, led in the middle overs by the parsimonious Johan Botha, started to take the pace off the ball, the pitch began to slow down further and the batsmen who followed the top three were struggling with timing. #p#<m14>Both Gambhir and Tendulkar were out when trying to push the pace,</m14> the batsmen who followed them believed that in <m15>the Power Plays</m15> demanded mayhem. They wanted to inflict it on the bowlers but ended up dispensing it on their team. A methodical response to the situation rather than flailing at full tosses or trying to hit the ball out of the ground would at least have seen India through the 50 overs. Eight more balls, maybe eight more runs. Small steps, significant meanings. #p#Dhoni's shuffling of the batting order - Yusuf Pathan before Yuvraj Singh, Virat Kohli at No. 7 - had been greeted with many a raised eyebrow, but the captain was backed by evidence from previous games, that his batsmen could independently work out the calculations of setting a total. The <m16>nine for 29</m16> that will sting Indians even harder in the week before their last group match, because when South Africa came in to bat, the Indian bowlers and fielders laid siege to the target of 297 with an energy and a spirit not found in previous games. When up against qualify opposition, Harbhajan lifted his game. <m17>Zaheer Khan conceded four off the penultimate over</m17>. <m18>Off the last over, the South Africans were left with 13 to get</m18>. India in the field had pushed as hard as they could. India with the bat tried to push too much. Everything turned upside down.
29	505909	India v South Africa, Group B, World Cup 2011, Nagpur	MS Dhoni hits out at batsmen	Sharda Ugra in Nagpur	March 12, 2011	#p#After India's implosion in Nagpur, MS Dhoni came into the captains' press conference and hit the first question out of the room, into the black sky of Jamtha and all over the headlines. <m1>India had just lost their first World Cup match to South Africa by five wickets</m1> and Dhoni criticised his batsmen who had made it happen. The team would have been helped greatly had they curbed not their enthusiasm but certainly their instincts today. #p#<m2>India lost nine wickets for 29</m2> <m3>to be bowled out for 296</m3>, when they were on course for something far bigger. The batsmen "don't need to play for the spectators - they love sixes and fours in India but at the end of the day....," Dhoni said. He spoke calmly, his agitation emerging mostly from his words. #p#The team, Dhoni said, always talked about a par score on every ground on which it played an ODI and responding to changing on-field situations. India were never able to do that in Nagpur, <m4>losing four for 30 in the batting Powerplay</m4>. "When you have 270 -280 on board, you go out there and what you want to do is play big shots and crowds always want those big shots. But different people have different roles and responsibilities. You need to bat 50 overs at least. Especially if you've lost two-three wickets in the first 35 overs, you should be able to bat 50 overs." He then added one of the more obvious truths in the game that had escaped the batsmen. "If you play 50 overs," Dhoni said several times in his 10-minute conference, "you get more runs." #p#<m5>The first two partnerships added 267</m5>, and it was the breadth of the platform that got the rest of the Indian batsmen going, given the fact that the team knew that 320 was thought of as a par score in Nagpur. "If you want a par score, you then start looking at 350 or 360 and you end up with 40 runs less." #p#Batting apart, despite some improvement in India's fielding, South Africa were still better. AFP Enlarge #p#Dhoni also said the Indians had struggled to defend their total of 296 because of the size of the VCA stadium affecting the Indians, and the differing standards of fielding between the sides. "I think with one of the bigest grounds in India here, we were tested by South Africa's fast running between the wickets. Most of the fielders got targeted and it won't be the case in some of the grounds which are not very big. #p#"Fielding was also the difference between the two sides. They fielded brilliantly even though we got off to a good start and had dominated our innings until the 35th or 38th over. But maybe the 15 runs they saved gave them a massive advantage." #p#Dhoni said he had called for <m6>the batting Powerplay</m6> (when India began to lose wickets) in order to try and use the last ten overs of the innings. "We wanted to use <m7>the batting Powerplay</m7> as well as the slog overs after that. If you can do that you carry momentum from <m8>the five overs</m8>, and sometimes you can score 100 runs in those ten overs." #p#The result, he said, was more than a disappointment. "It's a big learning curve," Dhoni said. "If you see the England v South Africa match, it just reminds you, that a game doesn't get over till it's over."
29	505943			Nikhil Chouguley		Choice of game. A World Cup match featuring two of the best cricketing nations in the world was just too good an opportunity to miss. Besides Nagpur being my hometown, the chance to see some spice between Zaheer Khan and Graeme Smith, and the prospects of watching Virender Sehwag "braai" Dale Steyn or vice versa made attending this game a no-brainer. #p# Mum's cooking and the oranges made this 5000 miles trip from Edinburgh to Nagpur all the more worthwhile. #p# Team supported. I like rooting for the underdog, even if it sometimes means supporting a team playing against India. However today there was no such moral dilemma, it was India all the way. During the course of the 2010 football World Cup, I developed an affinity for the South African football team, however their cricket team do not surface anywhere on my radar of compassion. #p# World Cup prediction. Being an eternal optimist, I am willing to forgive India's insipid performance over the last five matches. I think they are trying not to peak too early and are saving their best for the final. It's an open tournament, but I still believe India have in it in them to go all the way and lift the trophy. #p# Key performer. <m1>For the first 40 overs Sachin Tendulkar was simply awesome; he cut, drove and pulled the game away from South Africa</m1>. However, <m2>it was his hoick against the line that started the infamous Indian implosion</m2>. #p# <m3>At 296 all out</m3>, Fort Nagpur had fallen, and all India were left with was a dirty moat with four ducks splattered across it. Steyn the hunter and destroyer-in-chief, being responsible for the carnage. #p# One thing I'd have changed. Until you arrive at the cricket stadium, you scarcely realise that India was hosting the cricket World Cup. The razzmatazz and IPL-glammed-up-image of Indian cricket is in stark contrast to the apologetic ICC World Cup poster that greets you at the airport arrivals hall. #p# I want India to change this and welcome the world to its party. Also, I would have liked to have seen more "Saffas" in the stadium. #p# Accessories. A vuvuzela, bought in Johannesburg, but today turned against its parent nation, sunglasses, a camera and some ear plugs to shut out the din and gather my own thoughts, were the accessories that got me through the day. #p# Face-off I relished. The battle of swashbuckling Sehwag v supersonic Steyn didn't disappoint, and <m4>Zaheer's dismissal of Smith</m4> also panned out as expected. #p# Wow moment. I loved the star power and beauty of India's movie actresses, Ms Deepika Padukone and Ms Bipasha Basu to name but a few, however when the star dust settles, you realise that Bollywood has once again successfully gate-crashed cricket's party. #p# There was also a fly-over the VCA stadium by an IL 76 fighter plane from the Indian Air Force which drew a massive cheer from the crowd, and made me think there would be no airhostesses on that plane for the cricket ball to rise high and steal a kiss from touché Nikhil 1 Sidhu 0. #p# Close encounter. Virat Kohli was my man for all close encounters; missed catches, missed run outs and misfields. Unfortunately he didn't miss the bowler <m5>when he was caught and bowled by Robin Peterson</m5>. The chap did redeem himself in the field <m6>when he pulled off a stunning catch to help get rid of AB de Villiers</m6> and bring India back in the match. #p# Shot of the day. There were two shots that stood out: <m7>the first one was of Tendulkar against Morne Morkel, which can be best described as a forehand cross-court shot hit on the up.</m7> Unlike tennis, this stroke sounded like a gunshot when it hit the bat and sped off like a tracer bullet while the man retained his elegant poise. Ah! Poetry in motion. #p# <m8>The second was from de Villiers reverse-sweeping Zaheer off the stumps. You have to stand, admire and applaud either the fortune or the skill of this man who plays the kind of cricket I like - fearless.</m8> #p# Crowd meter. The stands were packed to capacity. The 40,000 spectators were buzzing, heaving with anticipation at the start and Sehwag didn't disappoint them. On the whole it was a very knowledgeable crowd which applauded good cricket even from the opposition. #p# However the crowds in Nagpur certainly need to seriously improve their chanting skills, with so many languages, songs and film dialogues to choose from, I am sure we can do better than shouting "Sachin-Sachin" even when he is not on the field. #p# Entertainment. In terms of music, "Papa Americano" was a super-catchy foot-thumping number, however, as Americans don't do cricket, this song seemed a bit out of place. Unsurprisingly the DJ decided to show off his highly evolved sense of international pop music, but in the process forgot to play some Marathi chart toppers. #p# The regional flavour was provided by the Indian drummers in blue clothes, and some chaps playing the Tutari, a Marathi version of the bugle which sounded the arrival of the Maratha warriors. #p# The DJ's use of "Waka Waka" was really well-timed when <m9>Steyn was blowing away the Indian tail with his yorkers</m9>. #p# Banner of the day. One girl offered to become Virat Kohli's wife through and another told her that the cricket stadium was not a matrimonial website. <m10>Another banner talked about Smith being Zaheer's bunny, and voila two overs later that prediction came true</m10>. #p# ODIs v Twenty20. I like ODIs as well as Twenty20s and see mutual synergies between them, rather than competition for survival of one at the cost of the other. #p# Marks out of 10. 9. It would have been 10 had the end result gone my team's way.
29	505991	World Cup 2011	The World Cup's new best friend	Sambit Bal	March 13, 2011	Games involving England have been the most entertaining so far thanks to their schizophrenic performances. Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Features : South Africa flourish, England struggle. Analysis : The Powerplay conundrum stumps Pakistan. Matches: India v South Africa at Nagpur. Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup #p#The main course is yet to be laid out but, despite the tournament retreating to obscurity for the major part of the past few weeks, the World Cup is well on its way to fulfilling one of its prime objectives. Already it has shown that there is life in one-day cricket. The crowds had never really turned away but, as the lure of Twenty20 has grown, the hum about the tiredness of one-day cricket has got louder. After all, there is only so much cricket that cricket can take. #p#The World Cup is indebted in large measure to England who, through a strange mixture of incompetence and indomitable spirit, have provided the best illustration of the ebb and flow and the variety one-day cricket can produce. In the five-matches involving them, we have seen almost the entire range: high-scoring heists, a heart-stopping tie, low-scoring thrillers, upsets, dramatic collapses, super defending, spectacular hitting, and last-gasp meltdowns. There is no telling where they will finish in this tournament but they are already worthy of a bonus for keeping the World Cup turning. #p#Add to that another star: the batting Powerplay. When it was first instituted it brought scepticism among those concerned about the already lopsided balance between the bat and the ball. It was feared that five more overs with field restrictions, that too at the choosing of the batting side, would lead to further mayhem against bowlers already short-changed by flat pitches, shrinking boundaries and meatier bats. What it has instead created is a period of play when anything can happen. #p#Ireland used it spectacularly in their game against England to mount the unlikeliest of victory charges and, against India last night, South Africa timed it perfectly to tame the asking rate to the territory of the manageable. But no way has the batting Powerplay been a one-way street. Indeed, <m1>as India demonstrated so dramatically during their self-induced combustion on Saturday, the batting Powerplay can be the most treacherous banana skin for the team calling for it.</m1> With the opportunity of runs, it also brings the threat of wickets. #p#But more than runs and wickets, it has brought strategy back to a period of the one-day game that had tended to drift along predictably, with fielders hanging back and batsmen churning out mechanical singles. More than anything else, it has imposed attacking cricket on both teams. #p#The batting Powerplay is different from the bowling Powerplays, both mandatory and optional, in two fundamental ways. The bowling Powerplays, invariably taken at a stretch, allow the batsmen to ease into a rhythm. In this World Cup particularly, opening batsmen have shown no particular haste. The starts have mostly been calculated and gradual, based on preservation rather than all-out acceleration. But the batting Powerplay, because it is so brief, and because it is often initiated by the batting side with the sole purpose of propelling the run-rate, obliges the batsmen to go over through the infield. Sometimes it can be dangerously disruptive. #p#England, coasting in their chase of 338 against India with such ease that it prompted the Bangalore fans to start leaving, found this out the hard way. Ian Bell, batting serenely till them and beginning to cramp, decided to launch Zaheer Khan into the night sky but ended merely lobbing the ball within the circle. Zaheer, who would have never bowled that over had the Powerplay not been taken, next produced the ball of the match to nail Strauss, playing his greatest one-day innings, and with two more catches in the infield England surrendered four wickets in those overs for 25 runs, before managing to tie the match. #p#<m2>India themselves had fluffed their own Powerplay earlier in the day by managing only 32</m2> at <m3>the cost of Sachin Tendulkar's wicket</m2> which restricted them to 338. At one point, a total of 360 had seemed plausible. #p#India's manhattan from the game against South Africa highlights the dangers of the Powerplay for the batting side. ESPNcricinfo Ltd Enlarge #p#It is a reasonable assumption that, for it to be counted as good, a batting Powerplay must yield 50 runs. It would count as super for the batting side to achieve without losing a wicket. But the quick look at the numbers tells us the 50-run mark has been breached in only eight of the 43 instances of the batting Powerplay, and, barring South Africa against India, each of this has been achieved against the non-Test playing nations (which currently includes Zimbabwe). #p#Equally revealingly, there have been only eight instances of a team going through the batting Powerplay without losing a wicket, and on 19 occasions, teams have lost two or more wickets, and seven times three or more. #p#Different teams have adopted different strategies. Pakistan have been delaying theirs till almost the very end, and this has worked for them apart from their loss against New Zealand. They stand second in the list of batting Powerplay run-rates (9.82, which is behind South Africa's 10.18) and No.1 in terms of having lost three wickets during these periods. #p#It's a policy England seem to have embraced after the Powerplay malfunction against India. This implies batting on without disrupting normal rhythm until the last five overs, when everything must go anyway. But this works on the principle that the team must have at least two batsmen capable of making the most of it. And overall, England have the worst batting Powerplay numbers among the top nations, with a run-rate of 6.40 at the cost of 12 wickets, the highest any team has lost during batting Powerplays. #p#India, whose sole gameplan revolves around batting their opponents out of the game, have tended to launch the final assault around the 35th over to coincide with the mandatory change of the ball. However, only once in five games, when they scored 48 without losing a wicket against Bangladesh, has this gone to plan. #p#There are lessons from these for both batting and bowling captains. India have seen it from both sides already. There was no other way for them to get back into the game against England apart from the Powerplay wickets; it was the same for South Africa when India were 267 for 1 in 40 overs in Nagpur. #p#If anything, the batting Powerplays have shown the value of posting fielders in the ring and denying the strolled single. And for batting teams, it is not merely the passport to easy runs for it can, equally swiftly, derail the innings beyond recovery. #p#Why batting sides are not more flexible about it is hard to fathom. <m4>India's score stood at 128 for no loss</m4> at end of the bowling Powerplays on Saturday, with <m5>both Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag in sublime ball-hitting zones</m5>. But did India even consider opting to extend the field restrictions to allow them to carry on the same way for five overs? As it turned out, the next five overs produced only 27 runs as Tendulkar and Sehwag adjusted to the changes in the field, and Tendulkar had to make another adjustment when <m6>the Powerplay was eventually taken 39th over</m6>, and <m7>promptly lost his wicket</m7>. #p#But while the batting Powerplay may not always be a blessing for the batting teams, it is quite so for the one-day game.
30	505823	Canada v New Zealand, World Cup 2011, Group A, Mumbai	New Zealand confident despite Vettori absence	The Preview by Andrew McGlashan	March 12, 2011	#p#Match Facts March 13, Mumbai Start time 9.30am (0400 GMT) #p#Ross Taylor will lead New Zealand in the absence of Daniel Vettori AFP Enlarge Related Links News : Vettori to miss Canada game Players/Officials: Harvir Baidwan | John Davison | Jesse Ryder | Ross Taylor | Daniel Vettori | Luke Woodcock Matches: Canada v New Zealand at Mumbai Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Canada | New Zealand #p#The Big Picture #p#There are formalities, then there's the major Test nations qualifying for the quarter-finals from Group A. While the numbers are crunched in the other side of the tournament there is precious little nail-biting going on in this group. New Zealand could have had a few difficult moments in progressing given their poor form heading into the World Cup, but they already stand on six points after the impressive victory over Pakistan. #p#This match against Canada shouldn't cause them to lose much sleep even though their captain Daniel Vettori will be missing with a knee injury. His absence for one match is a minor problem compared to him being ruled out of the tournament which was a concern when he went down in the field against Pakistan. It was important for New Zealand to dispatch a leading team in the qualification to build confidence and there were many positive signs, from Ross Taylor's powerful century to the incisive new-ball bowling. As has often been said, New Zealand raise their game in World Cups. #p#Still, there are issues within the team - mainly in the consistency of the top order. Taylor's innings was magnificent, albeit against awful bowling, but it can't be one-off for New Zealand. They also need more from Jamie How, Scott Styris and James Franklin to spread the workload. #p#To be fair to Canada they have had their moments this tournament and New Zealand need to show them respect. Their new-ball attack of Henry Osinde and Harvir Baidwan can create problems with early movement; Baidwan was mighty impressive Pakistan. Rizwan Cheema has promised more than he has delivered, but Canada's middle order was calm in their successful chase against Kenya. In this match, though, coming out with respectability should be considered a success. #p#Form guide (completed matches, most recent first) Canada : WLLLL New Zealand : WWLWW #p#Watch out for... #p#Nathan McCullum has quietly developed in a very useful player for New Zealand, both with his offspin and lower-order batting. In the absence of Vettori he'll have a senior role to play in the bowling attack, which will be valuable practice in case he is needed at important stages later in the tournament. The team will hope his batting down the list isn't required to provide too much, but he showed with his effort against Australia that he can build an innings and his striking power can also add the finishing touches in the closing overs. #p#Hanvir Baidwan has been consistent during the tournament with nine wickets at 20.22 and an economy rate of just over five-an-over. He caught Pakistan by surprise with three scalps and also took two against Kenya to help set up victory. New Zealand's top order is an inconsistent beast and it'll need to be careful not to take Baidwan lightly especially if there is any movement early on. #p#Team news #p#Having won the basement battle against fellow Associates Kenya there seems little reason for Canada to change a winning side. John Davison returned for that match, but in the middle order, and he'll be keen to produce a performance before the tournament is finished at the expense of a team he has a good record against. #p#Canada (probable) 1 Ruvindu Gunasekera, 2 Rizwan Cheema, 3 Zubin Surkari, 4 Ashish Bagai (wk), 5 Jimmy Hansra, 6 Tyson Gordon, 7 John Davison, 8 Harvir Baidwan, 9 Parth Desai, 10 Henry Osinde, 11 Balaji Rao #p#Vettori will be missing with his injured knee which could mean an outing for Luke Woodcock, the left-arm spinner, or a recall for fast bowler Hamish Bennett. Meanwhile, Jesse Ryder is recovering from the stomach bug that forced him to miss the Pakistan match and could replace the struggling Jamie How. #p#New Zealand (probable) 1 Martin Guptill, 2 Brendon McCullum (wk), 3 Jesse Ryder, 4 Ross Taylor (capt), 5 Scott Styris, 6 James Franklin, 7 Nathan McCullum, 8 Jacob Oram, 9 Luke Woodcock, 10 Kyle Mills, 11 Tim Southee #p#Pitch and conditions #p#This is Mumbai's first game of the tournament - the venue will also host the final on April 2 - so it will be interesting to assess the pitch conditions. The morning start suggests there could be some help for the seamers and Ross Taylor noted the extra grass on the net surfaces. #p#Stats and trivia #p#The two teams have previously met twice in World Cups, in 2003 when New Zealand won by five wickets and again in 2007 when they claimed a 114-run victory. #p#However, in both matches John Davison has made his mark with 75 off 62 balls in Benoni and 52 off 31 in Gros Islet. #p#Quotes #p#"I think it's more with rugby. It's not the same with cricket. The public doesn't have the same expectations as we have as players." Ross Taylor admits the World Cup probably hasn't grabbed the interest back home #p#"We are getting better and better with each game, the performances if you have noticed are getting better and better with each game."

Ross Taylor, their stand-in captain, believes if his team are assertive Canada are bound to crumble in Mumbai where the renovated Wankhede Stadium, the venue for the final next month, is staging its first game of the tournament. #p#"We know that if we can put the so called minnows under pressure earlier on, we can try to dominate from there," Taylor, who is covering for the injured Daniel Vettori, said confidently. "But we have to try and restrict them. We know the result should be a win," #p#Taylor also ruled out New Zealand playing with the specific intention of bettering their net run-rate in order to strengthen their standing in terms of who they may face in the quarter-finals. "Net run rate may play a part but the focus is to win the next two games whether chasing or batting first," he said. "Playing Canada you don't start doing things differently compared to playing against India for example. You've got to do good preparation." #p#Taylor is leading New Zealand on the back of his thunderous, unbeaten 131 against Pakistan which included brutal assault in the final overs where New Zealand ransacked 112 runs from the final six overs. Kyle Mills and Tim Southee then bowled aggressively to demolish the Pakistan batting top order so maintaining that momentum is the key for New Zealand going forward. #p#"We know we are a good side," Taylor said. "We believe in each other to put up good performances. The confidence in the camp is getting higher. Once you are on a roll and in cricket if there is some momentum going you get a bit of confidence from the momentum and you start playing better." #p#His counterpart, Ashish Bagai, will expect nothing less from his own team either after they scored a convincing victory against an out-of-sorts Kenya in Delhi. That win came after demoralising losses in the first three matches. "We are getting better and better with each game, the performances if you have noticed is getting better and better," Bagai said. #p#But Canada have had some tough few weeks. At the outset they had singled out the contests against Zimbabwe and Kenya to earn points. However, the brittleness of the batting was exposed against Zimbabwe where, chasing 298, Canada's top six fell for 66. Bagai likened their team appearing the World Cup as turning up to the Olympics once every four years without enough quality preparation and didn't want to be too harsh on his batsmen, but admitted mistakes had been made. #p#"In the first three games, and even the practices games, it was disappointing for us with the bat," he said. "We talked about having some self-belief for the guys coming in, getting to another level. Yes, we have a few young guys up the order who are struggling. But I still feel that senior guys like me, John [Davison] and Rizwan [Cheema] have to take some responsibility. We did not do that. Hopefully, the last two games, we can use the last game as a confidence booster for us." #p#Davison, Canada's most senior batsman, needs to stand up for his team. He began the tournament with consecutive ducks before being left out and on his return he was moved into the middle order agains Kenya where he came in for the final moments. Canada have played New Zealand at the last two World Cups in South Africa and West Indies and, on both occasions, Davison has hit sparkling fifties - the first one in 2003 was the third fastest at the time. The time has come for Davison to refresh those memories and create a new mark.

With New Zealand's two most devastating batsmen at the crease, <m31>the batting Powerplay</m31> was called for immediately afterwards, but <m32>Brendon McCullum was its first victim when he slapped Baidwan straight to Ruvindu Gunasekara at extra cover.</m32> #p#<m33>Though Rao picked up two wickets in the remaining overs</m33>, <m34>including that of Taylor</m34> for a 44-ball 74 that included four mighty sixes in the space of a single over, Canada completely unravelled in the field as the score went stratospheric. <m35>A whopping 74 runs came from the batting Powerplay</m35>, and <m36>122 from the last 10 overs</m36>, <m37>including 31 from the final over of the innings</m37> during which Rizwan Cheema was removed from the attack for his second beamer of the innings. #p#The signs were ominous for Canada when <m38>Ruvindu Gunasekara slashed at the first ball of Kyle Mills' second over and Taylor timed his leap to perfection at first slip to pluck the ball out of the air one handed</m38>. The boundary had still not been reached when, two overs later, <m39>Zubin Surkari hung his bat out limply at another Mills outswinger to offer Taylor his second catch.</m39> #p#<m40>Canada were 4 for 2</m40> and sinking fast, but <m41>Bagai and Hiral Patel wasted no time in launching a spirited fightback</m41>. Their effort was no doubt helped by a premature end to Mills' spell when he pulled up lame one ball after <m42>he had dismissed Surkari</m42>, <m43>clutching at his left knee in some pain and leaving the field straightaway.</m43> #p#Smart Stats. <m44>New Zealand's total of 358</m44> is their second highest in World Cups behind the 363 they made against Canada in 2007. They have six scores above 300 in World Cups. <m45>Brendon McCullum's century</m45> is his first in World Cups and his third overall in ODIs. His previous highest in World Cups was 76 against Zimbabwe in Ahmedabad. <m46>New Zealand scored 74 runs in the batting Powerplay</m46>, the most by any team in this World Cup. Pakistan are second, with 70 runs against Kenya. Ross Taylor's strike rate is the third highest for a New Zealand batsman for a fifty-plus score in World Cups. <m47>The 12 sixes hit in New Zealand's innings</m47> is the second highest for them in an innings in World Cups. The overall record is 18, jointly held by India and South Africa. Rizwan Cheema's economy rate of 13.24 is the fourth highest among all bowlers who have bowled at least four overs in an innings in a World Cup match. <m48>The 125-run stand between Ashish Bagai and Jimmy Hansra</m48> is the third highest for Canada for the third wicket in ODIs and the second highest in World Cups. <m49>Bagai's 84</m49> is his 16th fifty in ODIs and his highest score in a World Cup match. He has scored two hundreds and 16 fifties at an average of 38.44 in ODIs. <m50>Canada's 261</m50> is their highest total in World Cups, going past the 249 they made against New Zealand in 2007. #p#<m51>After a nerveless, shotless start to his innings Patel took Tim Southee on in stirring fashion, targeting the off side in a series of imperious thumps.</m51> <m52>He reached a fluent 31</m52> <m53>but was then undone by a well-directed bouncer from Jacob Oram that cramped him for room, a thin edge nestling safely in Brendon McCullum's gloves.</m53> #p#<m54>Their partnership had stretched to 46 at a good rate before it was broken</m54>, and Bagai's contribution had been steady, composed accumulation. <m55>He went into the 30s with a classy loft over cover off Nathan McCullum</m55> and <m56>continued in much the same gear in Hansra's company</m56>. #p#<m57>The pair added 125 for the fourth wicket, a partnership dominated by ones and twos but punctuated by a couple of strong shots whenever a bad ball was bowled.</m57> Though there was no chance it could result in a win, there was still the achievement that it was Canada's second-highest against a Test-playing nation, beaten only by Geoff Barnett and Ian Billcliff's 177-run stand against Bangladesh at the 2007 World Cup. #p#<m58>Bagai went to fifty by spanking a full toss from Kane Williamson to the cover boundary</m58>, but the searing heat of the Mumbai afternoon after he'd also kept wicket for the first half of the game began to take its toll. <m59>As cramps set in Bagai began to hit out in search of a century, but perished when a flashing drive resulted only in a thin edge behind.</m59> #p#<m60>It was cramp that did for Hansra too, and he retired on 53</m60> - <m61>his second half-century</m61> in successive games - soon after <m62>the batting Powerplay was taken in the 41st over</m62>. The match had long ceased to be a contest by that stage, the situation typified by <m63>Davison's amateurish run-out</m63>, but Canada's lower order did at least throw the bat around and <m64>Hansra returned to the crease after rehydrating to ensure they batted out the full 50 overs</m64>. #p#They can at least take some comfort in the way they have improved as a team in the course of this tournament. For their part, <m65>the win</m65> means New Zealand now top the Group A points table. #p#Match Timeline
30	506035	Canada v New Zealand, World Cup 2011, Group A, Mumbai	Davison woes and DRS questions	Nagraj Gollapudi at the Wankhede Stadium	March 13, 2011	<m1>Hiral Patel became yet another victim to the poor use of the DRS.</m1> AFP Enlarge Related Links Matches: Canada v New Zealand at Mumbai Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Canada | New Zealand #p#Drop of the day. <m2>Kane Williamson had just made his first run of the World Cup when he faced a simple off-break, delivered wide of the crease from around the stumps by John Davison. Erroneously, Williamson spooned a simple return catch to the bowler. But Davison, on the follow-through, messed up an easy chance as he tried catching it with upright hands. The habit of doing fielding drill with the baseball mitts at times can be a deterrent as Davison proved today. It was a schoolboy error going for the unorthodox technique when he could have taken the offering with straight hands.</m2> #p#If-only moment. <m3>Rizwan Cheema lined himself up at wide long-on trying to deflect Ross Taylor's third six in the most expensive over in the day by Harvir Baidwan (Taylor took 28 runs hitting four sixes and one four). Cheema rubbed his palms at the back of his trousers in anticipation as the ball was on the descent. Suddenly he realised the ball could fly over the ropes. So in a last-minute improvisation he arched back, took the catch, but unfortunately lost his balance as he skipped over the ropes. He did jerk the ball back, but his feet had already touched the ropes.</m3> <m4>Taylor was on 47</m4>, <m5>eventually making 74</m5>. Matches turn on moments like that. <m6>New Zealand were 210 for 4</m6>. The story might have had a different narrative, but then... #p#The DRS moment. <m7>Hiral Patel went for a wild pull against a short-pitched delivery from Jacob Oram on the off stump. At a distance it seemed it was a hit-and-a-miss shot. But Brendon McCullum, standing behind the stumps, and Oram appealed. The umpire disagreed. New Zealand asked for a review as they were confident they heard a noise. In the absence of Hot Spot or a Snickometer, the question was how could Steve Davies (the third umpire) ascertain if the noise heard was actually ball hitting bat. Davies went on to rule Patel out.</m7> One wonders how. #p#Catch of the day. <m8>Ross Taylor's ridiculous one-handed effort to interrupt a thick edge from Ruvindu Gunasekera, which was flying towards the third man, until the New Zealand captain decided to raise his hand.</m8> #p#Can-you-believe-it moment. <m9>Clearly time has come for Davison to call it a day. That is no exaggeration if you consider the way Davison ran himself out, deciding to walk back casually once he had deflected a Jacob Oram yorker, which had trickled down to the short-fine leg. Showing no urgency to finish the run Davison started ambling initially before deciding to walk the final ten yards. Reacting to the batsman's lethargy an alert Brendon McCullum lobbed a perfect throw to knock the stumps off. It was a shocking display by the tournament's oldest cricketer, who showed little respect towards the opponent and the game.</m9> Innings Dot balls 4s 6s PP1 PP2 PP3 Last 10 overs NB/Wides New Zealand 153 35 12 53/1 42/0(11-15) 74/2(37-41) 122/3 1/7 Canada 167 25 3 40/2 21/1(11-15) 37/2(41-45) 77/4 1/9
30	506057	Canada v New Zealand, World Cup 2011, Group A, Mumbai	Canada forget fielding basics	Nagraj Gollapudi in Mumbai	March 13, 2011	#p#Ashish Bagai showed grit, determination, patience and character trying to add respect to Canada's pursuit of a massive target. Unfortunately cramps and a mounting asking rate took their toll on Canada's captain. It was sad that Bagai missed out on a becoming the first centurion for Canada in this World Cup on a day they made their highest score against a Test-playing country. It was a sore miss. But looking at the broader picture, Bagai will be more disappointed at the rubbish fielding on display when New Zealand's batsmen built their domination. All those qualities Bagai brought to his batting, Canada's fielders neglected. It only cast them in poor light. #p#The frustrating part was the errors were mostly to do with the basics of fielding: positioning, lining up, being pro-active, backing up to throws, holding catches with soft hands, improvising... the list of things Canada's fielders failed in doing was longer than the longest boundary at the Wankhede. Take for example <m1>Henry Osinde, who was standing at short fine-leg when Brendon McCullum, on 71, swept Balaji Rao and tried going for a single. Osinde, a tall man no doubt, failed to cleanly collect the ball initially because he had failed to take a start. Then when McCullum was casual in returning to the crease, the Canadian failed to throw back the ball or worse go for a direct hit.</m1> Fielding coaches like Mike Young have always drilled this into a fielder: when the doubt exists whether or not to throw at the stumps, do so. It only builds an aggressive mindset. #p#It was just not the ground fielding. <m2>Even straightforward catches like Zubin Sarkari, failing to latch on to a low catch from Jesse Ryder</m2>, <m3>John Davison shelling a return catch from Kane Williamson when the batsman was on 1</m3> only dented the confidence of the bowlers. <m4>Williamson survived another chance when Harvir Baidwan managed to let one slither through his hands and between his feet.</m4> <m5>The New Zealander, playing his first match, finished unbeaten on 34.</m5> <m6>But the worst mistake came when Rizwan Cheema, standing at long-on, failed to improvise trying to hold on to the big hit from Ross Taylor. It was a difficult chance as Cheema, standing on the edges of boundary, had to intercept the ball's flight while making sure he did not touch the rope or cross over. Teams now have customised training sessions for such catches and make sure fielders understand the right methods to carry out such catches in order to avoid any mishaps during a match.</m6> #p#<m7>Ashish Bagai gave his all before cramp got the better of him.</m7> Pity his fielders can't say the same thing. AFP Enlarge #p#Of all the three departments of cricket, fielding is one area where every team stands at par - there is absolutely no distinction in the quality between Test-playing countries and the Associates. Fielding is a discipline that can only be sharpened by working hard on it, by finding ways to exert pressure, by training specialist fielders for specific positions. You don't need experience or exposure. What you need is a presence of mind, more than a little bit of agility, reflexes and to remain pro-active. The best fielders don't react, they just put themselves in a spot where they can make a difference. #p#Bagai was honest about admitting that Canada were terrible in the field. "It was very, very frustrating to me. I will be very honest. It was probably the worst effort we had in a very long time in the field," Bagai said after <m8>the 100-run defeat</m8>. "The catches and the ground fielding were awful. That put us back and put is in a hole chasing 350. We did not put any pressure on them by letting couple of guys having singles and twos in the outfield. It was a collective poor fielding effort by the team." #p#Automatically if the fielders are alert sometimes even a bad ball can be offset. The biggest advantage is it puts pressure on the batsman, who is then forced to change his gameplans. Otherwise, as Canada found out today, batsmen can even sleepwalk and get away with the crime.
30	506075	Canada v New Zealand, World Cup 2011, Group A, Mumbai	McCullum feels confidence growing for New Zealand	Nagraj Gollapudi in Mumbai	March 13, 2011	#p#Like Canada captain Ashish Bagai rightly pin-pointed in the end, <m1>New Zealand won the match an hour into the day</m1>. It was a period when Canada's seamers were supposed to build the pressure, take wickets and exert control on a pitch glistening with moisture. Instead it was Brendon McCullum who stamped his authority and built early momentum for New Zealand which they never lost for the rest of the game. <m2>McCullum's maiden World Cup century</m2> is bound to bring cheers to New Zealand, a team in the rebuilding phase. #p#Despite winning four out of the five group games so far, including the last three on a trot, New Zealand continue to remain pretenders. Injuries to key players like Daniel Vettori and today <m3>Kyle Mills pulling out due to a leg strain</m3>, the inconsistency of the top-order, and the untested middle-order, which has not got enough time due to easy victories against Kenya and Zimbabwe, are questions that nag New Zealand. #p#Still, McCullum believed that the team were on the right path. "The camp is slowly building some confidence. We are slowly starting to play how we want to play and we move into the next game knowing that we have played well over the last couple of games," he said. #p#New Zealand started their campaign by thrashing Kenya in their opening match, but perished against Australia in what was originally ticked as a marquee clash. John Wright was understandably admonished at the lack of application from the batsmen and gave them an earful in private, while jotting a list of dos and don'ts. The schoolboy treatment has worked. In their wins against Zimbabwe, Pakistan and today Canada, the top order worked hard on making sure they didn't gift their wickets away. #p#<m4>Brendon McCullum scored his first World Cup century</m4> as <m5>New Zealand coasted to a third straight win</m5>. AFP Enlarge #p#<m6>McCullum, in the company of Martin Guptill, took advantage of the wayward bowling from the Canadian seamers and the pair raised hopes of a big stand.</m6> But Guptill, like Jesse Ryder who replaced him, would be disappointed about not cashing in on a good start. Both men reined in their aggression and to play a controlled knock but then lost patience and fell to casual strokes. Fortunately McCullum hung around and played at a steady tempo. There was no adrenalin rush as he understood he could be aggressive by picking the bad balls while rotating the strike, a point Wright has noted in his book. #p#"Today was a key victory, too, because we were able to play to roles we were trying to play to and execute the kind of skills we were hoping to achieve. Anytime you win, anytime you perform well, anytime that you get some confidence out of the game, that certainly helps" he said. #p#Kyle Mills injury scare. <m7>Kyle Mills has a strain in his left quadricep, which he aggravated while bowling his third over and was forced to leave the field.</m7> The physio has advised him rest and a clear word on his status is expected in the next 48 hours #p#McCullum believed the reason New Zealand had more performers today was because every player is understanding his role and playing within himself. "When we came here we had gone through pretty tough time back home (a 3-2 series loss to Pakistan at home). But none of that mattered once we arrived here. It was a matter of making sure this team was able to go out and play its best cricket, each of us understood our roles. John Wright has been instrumental has been able to offer that experience and confidence to each player. We have seen this New Zealand team operate with a clear role which you can't say about some New Zealand teams in the past. The biggest turned around is that we are going in with more confidence," McCullum said. #p#New Zealand have entered World Cups in the past as underdogs, making the semi-finals twice in the last three World Cups (1999 and 2007). McCullum, who played in the 2007 edition, believed the past New Zealand teams created opportunities. This team is now following that example. "It is work in progress. The tournament is spun out over six to seven weeks. It is not a short tournament. It is a matter of trying to get momentum and when you get it you try and hold on it. From our point of view we have a little bit of momentum now and there is another great opportunity to continue that momentum we have built in the last few games. The confidence is starting to seep into the team. That is something we desperately need. We are proud of New Zealand teams have been able to achieve in the past World Cups - they consistently gave themselves the opportunity."
31	505783	Australia v Kenya, Group A, World Cup 2011, Bangalore	Australia mull Michael Hussey selection	Brydon Coverdale in Bangalore	March 12, 2011	Michael Hussey had been training hard since his arrival in India AFP Enlarge Related Links Preview : A mismatch in the offing News : Still not convinced about Associates - Ponting Players/Officials: Michael Hussey | Ricky Ponting Matches: Australia v Kenya at Bangalore Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Australia | Kenya #p#Ricky Ponting has nominated David Hussey and Steven Smith as the men in danger of being axed from Australia's side to squeeze Michael Hussey in for Sunday's match against Kenya. However, the Australians won't be tempted to rest any of their best XI, with Ponting's men desperate for action having been twiddling their thumbs during a two-week break since their last full game. #p#Hussey has trained strongly since joining the squad in Bangalore as the replacement for Doug Bollinger, impressing the medical staff with how quickly he has recovered from surgery on his hamstring. The Australians will wait to see how Hussey handles Saturday's training session before confirming him in the side, but Ponting said it would be a difficult call as to who would miss out. #p#"It's going to be a very tough decision, and one that up until a week ago we probably didn't think we'd have to make," Ponting said. "I've had a close look at [Mike] the last couple of days in training. He's striking the ball really well. The physio forced him to do some quite intense running yesterday out on the ground. He got through that particularly well. #p#"I think if you looked at two players that you'd have to single out who are in the same sort of position as Mike plays, it's going to be unfortunately probably his brother or someone like Steven Smith. They're the roles that Mike will come and play for us. We'll have that sorted out by the morning." #p#The chairman of selectors, Andrew Hilditch, was due to join the touring group on Saturday evening to replace David Boon as the selector on duty, and the Hussey decision is the only one likely to be required for this game. The backup players Callum Ferguson, Tim Paine and John Hastings will remain on the sidelines, but could come in to contention for Wednesday's clash with Canada. #p#The first-choice batsmen are in need of some valuable time in the middle, having not batted since the win over New Zealand in Nagpur on February 25. While sides like Sri Lanka and England have only one group match remaining, the Australians have three to play, and men like Ponting and Cameron White have spent hardly any time at the crease. #p#"We won't be resting," Ponting said. "We've had enough rest over the last 16 days. We've had about one-third of a game in the last 16 days. We've trained really hard, we trained really well leading into the Sri Lanka game and this week since we've been here in Bangalore, we've trained particularly well again, so we're really keen to get out there and play some cricket. #p#"What it does do, it gives you a chance to prepare very well. We should be exceptionally well prepared for the next two games we've got coming up because we've had such a long break. It gives our players a chance to get over any little niggles they might have had from the previous games as well. We're probably the only team in the tournament that will have a break that long. " #p#The Australians have played Kenya twice before in World Cups, winning with relative ease on both occasions, and the Kenyan outfit of 2011 is notably weaker than their previous line-ups. But Ponting said there was no way his men would slip in to complacency against Kenya, whose only wins against Test nations since 2003 have come against Zimbabwe. #p#"We won't take any game lightly," Ponting said. "We want to go out there and play the best cricket that we can. We know that we've got Kenya and Canada and then Pakistan just around the corner, then you've got quarter-finals and semi-finals. We haven't played a great deal of cricket yet in the tournament, so it's all about us getting our way right in the business end of the tournament, so that means that we go out tomorrow and play the best game of cricket that we possibly can."

A combination of Kenya's wobbling top order and Australia's pace battery means the Chinnaswamy Stadium could stage the biggest mismatch of the tournament on Sunday - the odds on one Australian betting site are so long that a 100### bet on a Kenyan defeat will only win you 50 cents. #p#It will be a relief for Australia to get back to cricket, having played their last full game as long ago as February 25. Things are set to become a lot more hectic for them, with their remaining three league matches coming up over the next week. They haven't had a tough workout in the tournament yet, and it is unlikely they will in their next two matches as well, against the Associates in the group, Kenya and Canada. Those encounters will be vital for Michael Hussey, who joined the squad after the rained-out match against Sri Lanka. If deemed fit, they will provide him the chance to adjust to subcontinent conditions. #p#Kenya know they have a tough task on their hands, and though chances of a win look remote, they have a couple of targets. First, if their batting, which has gradually improved over the World Cup - their totals read 69, 112, 142 and 198 - betters those scores, it will be an achievement. Secondly, Ricky Ponting has been a vocal supporter of the need for a streamlined World Cup, with lesser number of teams. What better chance to prove him wrong than by turning in a strong performance against the world champions? #p#Form guide (completed matches, most recent first) Australia WWWWW Kenya LLLLW #p#Watch out for... Cameron White has grown into a senior player in the Australian setup over the past two years. Leader of the national team in Twenty20s, he has also cemented his place as a big-hitting finisher. It's been a while since he played a big knock, though, with no half-century in 11 matches. The amiable Kenyan bowling could help him change that. #p#Tanmay Mishra is one of the talented youngsters to emerge from Kenya, and is only one of two batsman from the country to have an average above 30. He showed his maturity in the game against Canada, with a sedate half-century that revived Kenya after a familiar top-order collapse. #p#Team news Australia will resist the temptation to rest either of their frequently injured fast bowlers, Brett Lee and Shaun Tait, and will field their best XI. Ponting, though, still needs to decide what that best XI is, and whether to include the recovering Michael Hussey in the match. If they do, Ponting said either David Hussey or Steven Smith will make way. #p#Australia (probable) 1 Shane Watson, 2 Brad Haddin (wk), 3 Ricky Ponting (capt), 4 Michael Clarke, 5 Cameron White, 6 Michael Hussey/David Hussey, 7 Steven Smith, 8 Mitchell Johnson, 9 Brett Lee, 10 Jason Krejza, 11 Shaun Tait #p#Steve Tikolo has been struggling with a stomach bug, and though he is recovering it remains to be seen whether he will be fit for Sunday's match. #p#Kenya (probable) 1 Maurice Ouma (wk), 2 Seren Waters, 3 Collins Obuya, 4 Steve Tikolo, 5 David Obuya, 6 Tanmay Mishra, 7 Thomas Odoyo, 8 Jimmy Kamande (capt), 9 Nehemiah Odhiambo, 10 James Ngoche, 11 Elijah Otieno. #p#Pitch and conditions The match will be played on the same track that was used for the England-Ireland match, which produced more than 650 runs, so Ponting expects an easy surface for the batsmen on Sunday. The weather is also expected to be pleasant; sunny but not too humid. #p#Stats Thomas Odoyo has been Kenya's best allrounder: he's their leading wicket-taker in one-dayers, and the second highest run-getter as well #p#Shaun Tait has a strike-rate of 26.3 in one-dayers, the best among all bowlers who have sent down at least 1000 deliveries #p#Kenya have lost all four of their encounters with Australia, and only once have they really tested Australia, in September 2002 when Shane Watson's unbeaten 77 sealed a last-over win #p#Quotes "As we've seen in the tournament so far, there is a possibility of upsets happening... we won't take any game lightly." Kenya have not been at their best so far in the tournament but Ricky Ponting isn't letting Australia get complacent #p#"The guys are really looking forward to playing the top teams, so far I think we have let the fans down, hopefully tomorrow we come up and help them enjoy the day."

Early in the tournament, Ponting said fewer teams would make for a better tournament. As his side prepared for Sunday's clash with Kenya, a team that hasn't had a significant win in eight years, he said his view hadn't changed. #p#"There have been a couple of upsets," Ponting said. "From what I've seen, it looks like Ireland have come a fair way. But I am still a believer that it [the World Cup] should be a place only for the best eight or ten teams. I think what we've got at the moment is probably a couple too many. But by the same token, I absolutely understand the reasons behind the other teams being here. #p#"It's about trying to grow the game everywhere around the world and giving these other smaller countries some exposure to cricket at the highest level. What I've always said is I'd like to see any of those qualifiers that come in really dominate the level below international cricket for a long period of time. At least then you know that you've got a team that's going to be competitive in a tournament like this." #p#Australia have not lost against a non-Test side since 1983, when they were upset by Zimbabwe in the World Cup. They face Kenya on Sunday and Canada on Wednesday, and there is a chance they could face Bangladesh - the ninth-ranked among the full members in ODI - in the quarter-finals after their memorable victory over England in Chittagong. #p#"They've never been classified as a minnow," Ponting said of Bangladesh. "They beat us in Cardiff a few years ago. With all their games at home, there was always a chance they could cause a couple of upsets, last night was probably one. They let one slip against the West Indies with a bit of an abysmal performance, but in their conditions they are a very competitive team."

"Everybody who hasn't played against Australia thinks this is a very good opportunity because you never know in life you may never get to play against Australia," he said. "So everybody is looking forward to it, the guys are up for it, and as long as the guys givn 110%, I'll be happy. You never know, the team that plays better cricket on the day will carry the day." #p#The main stumbling block for Kenya has been their batting, which has flopped on each of the four matches they have played in the tournament so far, leading to heavy defeats. "The greatest concern has been the top-order batting, in each and every game, even the last one against Canada, most of the times we have been 100 or less for five wickets," he said. "We have a lot of talent in our team, a few guys who have spent time in the middle, hopefully we can moving forward from one guy doing well to two-three guys doing well in a game." #p#Kenya already have no chance of reaching the quarter-finals after losing four matches, but felt the remaining games were also important for the experience they will provide. "This tournament is a stepping stone to Kenyan cricket again," he said. "A lot of guys here have never been to the World Cup, we know what it takes to achieve here, whatever we gain, we take it back home with us and try to improve our performance."
31	505984	Australia v Kenya, World Cup 2011, Group A, Bangalore	Australia win easily but Kenya regain pride	The Report by Andrew McGlashan	March 13, 2011	#p#Australia 324 for 6 (Clarke 93, Hussey 54) beat Kenya 264 for 6 (C Obuya 98*, Mishra 72) by 60 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details #p#Michael Hussey was quickly up and running on his return from injury Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Analysis : Australia content with game, after long wait Players/Officials: Michael Clarke | Brad Haddin | Michael Hussey | Tanmay Mishra | Collins Obuya Matches: Australia v Kenya at Bangalore Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Australia | Kenya #p#Australia's World Cup campaign resumed with an ultimately comfortable 60-run victory against Kenya, although Collins Obuya's unbeaten 98 meant the Associate nation took pride out of the contest. An upset was never on the cards but Kenya put in their best performance of the tournament with the highlight being the 115-run stand between Obuya and Tanmay Mishra. #p#The imposing run chase had been set up by a 114-run partnership between Michael Clarke and the returning Michael Hussey in his first innings of the World Cup. It actually gave Australia some important breathing space, but Kenya had long-since given up any hope of chasing down 325 on the ground where Ireland shocked England earlier in the tournament. #p#The most tension came in the closing overs, when Obuya could have reached his maiden one-day century - and Kenya's first at a World Cup - but he failed to get the three runs he needed off the last two balls. However, Ricky Ponting will be acutely aware that his team were far from impressive especially in the field. The bowlers, except for Brett Lee, certainly looked rusty as Kenya posted their best World Cup total. #p#After an early strike each for Lee and Shaun Tait it appeared Kenya would fall in a heap. Maurice Ouma edged a good outswinger and Alex Obanda, after driving Tait over long-on with one of the shots of the tournament, missed an ugly heave at a quick full toss. When the Obuya brothers mislaid their sibling understanding, which resulted in David Obuya's run-out, there was an opportunity for a swift finish. #p#However, Collins refocused after the mix-up, and firstly provided solid support for Mishra in Kenya's sixth World Cup hundred stand before forming another strong partnership with the aggressive Thomas Odoyo, who struck the ball cleanly. Obuya, who became famous for his legspin heroics at the 2003 World Cup, passed his fifty with a wonderful lofted drive over long-off against Shane Watson, then took advantage of the batting Powerplay. He twice pulled Watson's medium pace for six but couldn't quite get the final boundary he needed for three figures. #p#In 24-year-old Mishra, Kenya also have someone who provides hope for the future. On a day where Tikolo, the grand old father of Kenyan cricket, was left out, Mishra showed he has a huge role to play if the game is to recover in the country. He showed some class with swift footwork against Steven Smith to firstly pull him over midwicket for six, then loft him through the off side and played a similar stroke against Jason Krejza. #p#Smart Stats Australia's 324 is their 14th 300-plus score in World Cups and their 63rd in ODIs. They have won on all the occasions that they have scored over 300 in World Cups. Australia extended their unbeaten run in World Cups to 33 consecutive matches since their loss to Pakistan in the 1999 World Cup. Among captains who have led their teams in at least 75 ODIs, Ricky Ponting's win-loss ratio of 3.39 is second only to Clive Lloyd's win-loss ratio of 3.55. Michael Clarke scored his sixth half-century in World Cups taking his average to 101.83. Overall, he has scored five centuries and 47 fifties in ODIs at an average of 44.54. Michael Hussey's 54 is his first fifty in World Cups. Surprisingly, he has only scored 141 runs in World Cup games at an average of 23.50. The 115-run stand between Tanmay Mishra and Collins Obuya is the third highest for the fourth wicket for Kenya in ODIs and their second best in World Cups. Mishra's 72 is his fifth half-century and highest score in ODIs, surpassing his previous best of 66 against Scotland in 2006. Kenya's total of 264 is their highest total in World Cups, surpassing their previous best of 254 against Sri Lanka in the 1996 World Cup. Collins Obuya's 98 is the highest score by a Kenya batsman in World Cups, surpassing Steve Tikolo's 96 in the 1996 World Cup. This is only the sixth occasion that a team has crossed 250 in the second innings of a World Cup match against Australia. Only on one occasion has a team scored over 250 in a winning chase against Australia in World Cups. #p#His fifty came off 63 balls and he set a new career-best mark when he reached 67. This isn't the Australia attack of previous World Cups but it remains a handy unit. There was a chance for Mishra to convert his fifty into a notable century, but he was caught short by Clarke's dead-eye throw from backward point. He had already, however, ensured his team respectability. #p#The biggest bonus for Australia was the performance of Hussey, who replaced his brother David in the line-up, on his return from injury, having come into the squad for Doug Bollinger. At 143 for 4, Australia needed a solid partnership, and Hussey, getting off the mark with a first-ball boundary, formed a confident partnership with Clarke. #p#Hussey didn't drop below a run-a-ball during his stay and although he'll face far tougher tasks than this Kenya attack, it was a more valuable innings than any net session could provide. He was quick on his feet, gave the hamstring a good test with a few dives for the crease and his placement was as calculated as it always has been. #p#Clarke, meanwhile, ticked over with minimal fuss after feeling his way in against the spinners on a surface that offered turn to maintain his World Cup average of over 100. After Hussey departed Clarke began to open up during the batting Powerplay and collected four boundaries in quick succession including a six over midwicket. He'd equalled his highest score in World Cup matches when he couldn't quite clear long-on to give the deserving Nehemiah Odhiambo his third wicket. #p#The lack of time in the middle for the batsmen could well have played a part in Ponting's decision to bat and Watson was quickly out of the blocks until he top edged to the keeper. Australia then went through a period where seven overs brought 14 runs and Brad Haddin was having particular trouble forcing the pace as he kept hitting the field. He also had a couple of close calls: he was fortunate when an edge flew past slip on 16, while he could have been run out on 25 when his bat got stuck in the adjacent pitch. #p#Steadily, though, he increased the scoring rate and brought up his fifty off 63 balls with a deft glide to third man only to pick out long-on attempting his second six. That began a good period for Kenya as Obuya trapped Ponting lbw for a scratchy 36 after correctly opting to review the original not-out decision. Cameron White, who retained his place ahead of David Hussey, continued his lean run when he was beaten by a ripping delivery from Jimmy Kamande and both he and his captain will want a significant innings against Canada on Wednesday.
31	506074	Australia v Kenya, World Cup 2011, Group A, Bangalore	Stunning spin and a waist-high welcome	Siddarth Ravindran and Brydon Coverdale in Bangalore	March 13, 2011	Cameron White was left stunned by Jimmy Kamande's raging turner Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Matches: Australia v Kenya at Bangalore Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Australia | Kenya #p#Giant-killer of the day #p#For a part-time legspinner from an Associate nation, Collins Obuya has some pretty handy names in his list of victims over the years. He has only 30 ODI wickets from 91 matches, but among those he has dismissed are Rahul Dravid, Jacques Kallis, Adam Gilchrist, Younis Khan, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Aravinda de Silva, Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene. Now you can add to that list Ricky Ponting, who failed to pick a delivery that went straight on and was given lbw after the Kenyans asked for a well-judged review of a not-out decision from Richard Kettleborough. And as Obuya showed later in the evening, he can bat a bit, too. #p#Shot of the day #p#Until tonight, Kenya's batting had shown little backbone this tournament, and they were widely expected to roll over against Australia's express attack. Tell that to Alex Obanda. He might never have faced someone of the pace of Shaun Tait, but that didn't stop him from clouting the fourth ball he faced hard and flat over third man for six. If that was an astonishing stroke, Obanda bettered it in Tait's next over - walloping a slower ball over long-on for the biggest six of the match. #p#Ball of the day #p#When the fiercest turners in world cricket are discussed, Jimmy Kamande is not a name that comes to mind. So it was a surprise to all observers when Kamande spun one sharply through the gate to bowl Cameron White, who was attempting to drive through the off side. White looked stunned as he realised what had happened, and trudged off the field as the only Australian batsman who failed to reach double figures. #p#This-could-get-ugly moment of the day #p#Given that Kenya had just lost the battle of the Associates in Group A, the fear heading into their match against world champions Australia was that it would be cringe-inducingly one-sided. Those fears grew as early as the second over of the match, when Shane Watson contemptuously swatted 14 off three deliveries, ending that sequence with a brutal hit over midwicket for six. #p#Welcome of the day #p#Michael Hussey has spent the past month at home in Perth, wishing he was at the World Cup. Now he is. And when he walked out into the middle of the Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bangalore with Australia at a slightly worrying 4 for 143, he couldn't have asked for a friendlier greeting. Collins Obuya served up a waist-high full toss that Hussey calmly punched to the cover boundary.
31	506083	Australia v Kenya, Group A, World Cup 2011, Bangalore	Australia content with game, after long wait	Brydon Coverdale at the Chinnaswamy Stadium	March 13, 2011	#p#When Ricky Ponting walked out to toss the coin at the Chinnaswamy Stadium, his batsmen had not had an innings for 15 days. Since the Australians last batted, against New Zealand in Nagpur on February 25, India and England had each completed four matches, and Sachin Tendulkar alone had spent more than eight hours at the crease. There are only so many throwdowns from the coach that a batsman, and Tim Nielsen's shoulder, can take. #p#At the end of the 60-run win over Kenya, the Australia were content with what they achieved. The batting was good without being outstanding, while three wickets from the bowlers and three run-outs was below-par against the 13th-ranked team in the world. But the captain knows his attack has already bowled out New Zealand and Zimbabwe in this tournament. More important on Sunday night was that they spent 100 overs on the field. #p#Michael Hussey, hamstring reattached to the bone and position in the side reconfirmed, slotted in at No. 6 as if he had never been away. The in-form Michael Clarke continued to display his classy touch. Brad Haddin's innings featured as much rust as a wrecking yard, but it was gradually shed. He eventually found his timing in a contribution of 65, though against stronger sides his slow starts might be more of a problem. #p#Ponting could have used a bit more time in the middle and must have been furious at himself for falling to Collins Obuya, whose loopy legbreaks appear less threatening than the ones Ponting himself occasionally delivers in the nets. But he played some fine shots in his 36, and can build on that against Canada on Wednesday. Shane Watson fell in the eighth over, but his form is not in doubt. #p#The main concern remains Cameron White, who was bowled for 2, trying to drive against the offspin of Jimmy Kamande. White has now played 12 innings since his last half-century, and didn't contribute much to the two warm-up losses, either. He has the backing of Ponting, who has maintained the old "he's batting well in the nets" line, but White needs to justify that faith. #p#Michael Clarke has scored 175 runs in this World Cup and only been dismissed once Associated Press Enlarge #p#He'll now have one of the squad's better players of spin, David Hussey, hovering and waiting to regain his position. And as Clarke and Michael Hussey showed against Kenya, Australia need their finest handlers of slow bowling in the starting line-up in these conditions. At his best, Clarke is light on his feet and quick with his thinking, and both those attributes were evident in his 93. #p#He used the crease against the spinners, lulling them into giving him half-volleys or half-trackers, and accelerated towards the end of his innings in a most un-Clarke-like manner. In the past year, Clarke has averaged 67.83 in one-day internationals, and when he finally holed out to long-on, it was the first time he had been dismissed in the tournament, during which he has scored 175 runs. #p#Together with Hussey, he helped Australia out of a slightly sticky situation at 143 for 4. Their 114-run partnership was classic Clarke and Hussey: pierced gaps, quick singles, risks avoided, crisis averted. It also answered any questions about whether it was the right move to fly Hussey out from Perth to replace Doug Bollinger, altering the balance of the squad. #p#"He played the way that we know he can play," Ponting said of Hussey. "That's his class and his experience shining through. I thought for his first game back in the international team for six or seven weeks, it looked like he hadn't missed a beat. His timing right from the start was great. He didn't appear to be hindered at all throughout his innings or in the field. It's a great sign for us going forward. #p#"The fact that we've got 100 overs out of this game was a good sign for us. It probably would have been an easier option for us today to turn up and win the toss and bowl, but we needed a good solid hit-out. We got a good, solid 50 overs with the bat and 50 overs with the ball." #p#In doing so, Australia qualified for the quarter-finals and recorded their 33rd consecutive World Cup match without a loss. And after a fortnight spent in airports, hotel rooms and nets, that was all Ponting wanted.
31	506088	Australia v Kenya, World Cup 2011, Bangalore	Collins Obuya proves Kenya's worth	Siddarth Ravindran in Bangalore	March 13, 2011	#p#In a match billed to be between a flyweight and a heavyweight, Kenya managed to go the distance, avoiding their widely predicted fate of embarrassing failure against the champions Australia, who are undefeated in 32 World Cup matches. #p#A 60-run defeat may not seem much to crow about, but for a team whose senior-most player said a day before the match that the country's cricket is at its lowest ebb, and one which was coming off a loss in the one match their captain was expecting success in, against Canada, it's a worthy achievement. #p#Australia dominated the match but there were pockets of joy for Kenya, who have had so little to cheer since the tournament began. "It was good to see the boys having fun out there, which is the most important thing as a sportsman," their captain Jimmy Kamande said after the match. #p#Their celebrations on taking wickets highlighted how much they were enjoying themselves, not satisfied with mere high-fives, they resorted to jigs with team-mates and Kamande himself was jiving after dismissing Brad Haddin. Even when Australia were past 300, their spirits weren't dampened: fast bowler Nehemiah Odhiambo had a huge grin after beating Michael Clarke with a slow bouncer in the 47th over. #p#Perhaps the most pleasing aspect of their performance with the 264 they managed in the chase. Kenya's batting in the initial matches of the tournament had been so miserable that even against fellow Associates Canada, Kamande only set his side the modest aim of batting out 50 overs. That compared with their task against Australia of facing the fastest attack in the tournament, with three men capable of hitting 150kph, to say nothing of heads and toes. #p#The contest between Australia's new-ball operators and Kenya's tottering top-order was potentially going to be the best advertisement for excluding Associate nations from the World Cup. Instead, it provided the most thrilling example of Kenya's defiance. #p#Collins Obuya gave the beleaguered Kenya fans plenty to cheer about Getty Images Enlarge #p#The recalled opener Alex Obanda blocked a few deliveries before latching on to a short and wide one from Shaun Tait and hammering it over the third-man boundary for six. That left Tait nonplussed, and there was more chin-scratching for the bowler when Obanda clobbered a slower ball into the stands beyond long-on. #p#When two wickets went down in the first Powerplay, and worries that Kenya's ability to resist resurfaced, Tanmay Mishra kept it going, beginning with a six and a four off Steven Smith. His parents had flown down from Nairobi, and his brother, who studies in Bangalore, provided vocal support as for an hour and a half as Mishra and Collins Obuya were barely troubled by the Australian spinners. #p#Obuya had begun slowly, but after his century stand with Mishra ended, he pulled out the big shots as well, smacking Shane Watson into the crowd three times. Along with the belligerent Thomas Odoyo, Kenya ransacked 114 runs at more than seven an over. #p#Even with the late-hitting the chase was never on, but the interest was sustained till the final delivery. A powerful pull for four followed by a crashing drive past extra cover off Mitchell Johnson in the penultimate over, left Obuya needing four more to reach a maiden one-day century. He only got the strike on the fourth ball of the final over, and finished on an unbeaten 98 as Tait delivered a yorker to finish the innings. #p#"I'm very proud of the innings against the world champions," Obuya said. "It is very great to score runs against them, and a not out makes it even better. I'm wanted a century very badly, but I'll settle for 98 each and every day against Australia." #p#To be sure, Australia were never really in danger of losing, but Kenya gave the surprisingly healthy Chinnaswamy crowd of 13,600 - with their natural sympathy for the underdog, and joy at seeing Australia labour - plenty to shout about. #p#Kamande was satisfied with the improved show though he rated the series win against Afghanistan last October higher. "At the end of the day, it's about the matches that you win, not just the performances you give out there," he said. "A good show from most of the lads. The important thing is that we keep improving every match." #p#The improvements haven't yet secured a victory for Kenya, but they have a chance to bow out of the tournament with one when they come up against a more evenly matched opponent in Zimbabwe next Sunday.
32	506013	Bangladesh v Netherlands, Group B, World Cup 2011, Chittagong	Bangladesh not complacent, says coach	Sidharth Monga in Chittagong	March 13, 2011	#p#A day after their crucial win over England, the Bangladesh team has already been promised rewards by a private business house: a million taka each to Mahmudullah and Shafiul Islam, the ninth-wicket partnership that fashioned the unlikely win, and a lakh each to the rest of the team. There was even a function organised last night, but the BCB had to get the festivities postponed. The World Cup is not yet over, and Bangladesh need to guard against this kind of complacency when they face Netherlands. #p#It is an interesting situation that Bangladesh find themselves in. They are alive in the tournament, yet they also rely a lot on England and Ireland not winning their matches against West Indies and South Africa respectively. While that should leave them really charged up for the game against Netherlands, it is not hard to see why complacency can creep in. Netherlands have never played in Bangladesh before, and they are bound to encounter problems playing the spinners who tied England in knots. #p#"Each time we play a game, we try to win," Jamie Siddons, the Bangladesh coach, said. "So there is no complacency. That game is forgotten now, we move on. Whole new set of players, whole new set of plans, and possibly a whole new team." The whole new team points to the possible inclusion of another left-arm spinner, Surhawadi Shuvo, because Netherlands have a lot of right-hand batsmen in their line-up. #p#There are other possible distractions too. One of them is Bangladesh's poor net run-rate, at -1.241. To secure themselves against the eventuality of England's beating West Indies and Ireland winning their remaining games, Bangladesh either need to win both their remaining games, or win this one by a margin so huge that they rectify their net run-rate a bit. Beating South Africa, which is Bangladesh's last game, is a huge task, Siddons admitted. #p#Suhrawadi Shuvo could be picked for Monday's fixture AFP Enlarge #p#"Mathematically if England win their next game, we can't get in, unless we win against South Africa, which is a very difficult task," Siddons said, the assumption being that Bangladesh beat Netherlands. "I am not going to guarantee that we will win against South Africa. We need to win the next two games. If England win their game, doesn't matter what we do in this game if we can't win the last game. Run-rate is very poor." #p#The wise thing would be to not go after the net run-rate tomorrow, instead just secure the two points, which going by rankings, they are expected to. Siddons agreed. "We won't focus on the run-rate," Siddons said. "We have got to win the match, and then win against South Africa, and we are through. That's the main focus, make sure we look after the business here. Just execute our plans, no slip-ups tomorrow. And worry about the other results after that. Quarter-finals will be great, but we have got to play good cricket." #p#Boosting the net run-rate is not an easy task in Bangladesh, unless a team gets dismissed for 58. "The run-rate thing is really difficult here, because our wickets aren't really 300-run wickets," Siddons said. "Whereas over there [in India] it seems everybody is making 300 easily. Our pitches and our grounds are very different to those in India and Sri Lanka. Wickets are a lot harder to make big scores on here. You have to be very careful, chasing 300 on our wickets. Very difficult." #p#The distractions aside, Siddons was a confident man on the eve of the game. The reason is not hard to see. "Everyone's confidence was a little knocked around [after the 58 all out]," Siddons said. "That [the win against England] gives us confidence again. Our bowlers are definitely doing the job, and our batsmen have stepped up and made enough runs to win the game against a very good team. It gives us a lot of confidence. This team [England] drew with India and beat South Africa, don't forget that. And we beat them. We are ready to go for the next two games." #p#More importantly, what pleases Siddons is that Bangladesh have won both the games that went close. "I am really happy with the way we are winning the close games," he said. "Against New Zealand as well [in the whitewash], we won a couple of really close games. And Zimbabwe. It's starting to become a feature of our cricket. We don't give up easily. If we get within striking distance, we come out in front rather than lose those games now, which wasn't the case in our history." #p#Bangladesh will hope they can win against Netherlands without actually making it a tight game, but beware a side that has nothing to lose and a party to spoil.
32	506025	Bangladesh v Netherlands, Group B, World Cup 2011, Chittagong	Netherlands out to ruin hosts' party	Sidharth Monga in Chittagong	March 13, 2011	#p#Netherlands drew the wrong group in this World Cup. They must feel rotten every time they watch Canada and Kenya go through the motions in the other group. However, Group B has been richer for their presence, and they have contributed in their own way in making the group interesting, not least by scoring 292 against England and having India at 99 for 4. Now that they cannot make it to the quarter-finals, Netherlands draw motivation from knowing that they can make the group even more interesting by ruining on a party or two. #p#"I am not too sure how it will suit Ireland, as in them trying to qualify, but Bangladesh are right in the mix to qualify," Peter Borren, their captain, said. "Ireland also there or thereabouts. It definitely will be our intention to ruin that party for them, and I guess it's nice at this time with our games against Bangladesh and Ireland. It's good that they still have a bearing on the tournament, on the qualification for the next round. It is a very strong group, and we have seen it's not been easy to predict results. It's just great that we can go in there, and the matches that we play still count." #p#If Netherlands manage to cause an upset in their next game, against Bangladesh, they will have done them a major disservice, for then Bangladesh will have to win against South Africa to have any shot at making it to the next round. They can draw inspiration from their only international meeting with Bangladesh, a six-wicket win in Glasgow, but they know the Glasgow result matters as much to Chittagong as Scotland does to this World Cup. #p#"There is no doubt we get some positives out of the win we had against Bangladesh last year," Borren said. "We have played them once, and we have had that win. It was in completely different conditions, foreign conditions for Bangladesh, and the end of a long tour for them. We take positives out of it, but we are very realistic about the challenge we are going to confront tomorrow, and in these conditions Bangladesh are obviously a very difficult team to beat." #p#Netherlands have no hopes of qualification, but can ruin a party or two Getty Images Enlarge #p#Netherland's big challenge will be no prior knowledge of the conditions that have managed to surprise the best of the teams. Moreover they have hardly played Bangladesh at top levels. "Our knowledge of our opponents and the conditions are pretty limited," Borren said. "We have watched them play quite a bit, and we saw them play here in Bangladesh, against England the other night, so we are pretty aware of what we are going to come up against. And conditions as well, something we have practised quite a lot playing against spin on slow wickets, coming into this tournament. I guess the match tomorrow, the conditions that we are going to get, are the epitome of what we have been training for." #p#Netherlands will try to prey on the fact that Bangladesh have a lot more to lose, and that they can be an inconsistent side. "Tomorrow, us coming here and beating Bangladesh at home would be an upset I guess," Borren said. "As we have seen, Bangladesh can be an unpredictable team, a team which has its problem with consistence. After a really good win they had the other day, I know we still have a good chance of beating them tomorrow. That's what we'll be looking to do." #p#Netherlands might not have much to lose in terms of progression to the next rounds, but they have their goals to attain. Having played the tough teams until now, they are looking to turn a corner in terms of results. "Coming into this tournament we wanted to create chances to win games, and we wanted to try and take those chances," Borren said. "So far we've had a pretty difficult draw, we've come up against four top teams probably, on paper. Obviously tomorrow and Ireland are not going to be easy games. #p#"But you know we have played against four top teams, we have played two good games against England and I think we competed well with India the other day. Two disappointing performances against South Africa and West Indies in between. To be honest, we have played those four really really tough games, we now look to win these two last games. If we can leave having played four tough games, playing well in them, and then winning these two last games, I think we will be very happy with that."
32	506060	Bangladesh v Netherlands, Group B, World Cup 2011, Chittagong	Plenty at stake for buoyant Bangladesh	The Preview by Siddhartha Talya	March 13, 2011	#p#Match Facts March 14, Chittagong Start time 9.30am (0330 GMT) #p#Ryan ten Doeschate has to step up Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Matches: Bangladesh v Netherlands at Chittagong Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Bangladesh | Netherlands #p#The Big Picture #p#Bangladesh have said the right things in the aftermath of a stunning win over England that has kept their quarter-final prospects alive. Though the euphoria of that thriller is yet to die down among the public, who've reacted to that performance by showering rewards upon the players, the coach and the team have their feet firmly on the ground. In what has proved the more competitive and the more interesting group this competition, the race for a place in the final eight remains wide open, the doors completely shut only on Netherlands. But the Dutch are out to ruin a party or two, and in their upcoming games against Bangladesh and Ireland, they meet two teams they would have had a realistic expectation of beating at the start of the World Cup. #p#The Bangladesh coach Jamie Siddons has warned against complacency. He has admitted beating South Africa - Bangladesh's last game in the group stage - will be difficult, making the Netherlands fixture a virtual must-win encounter. Their net run-rate of -1.241 is also a concern, one that can be offset with wins in their remaining matches. And there is a good chance their fate rests on the mercy of other results, given overcoming South Africa is likely to be an uphill task. England drifting out of contention with a loss to West Indies and Ireland being shut out by South Africa will open up possibilities for Bangladesh. #p#While Netherlands are capable of springing a surprise, they'll know they are up against a superior team based on performance. And their task will be made more difficult by their inexperience in Bangladesh conditions, with the slow and low pitch and the hosts' arsenal of spinners presenting a daunting challenge. After inflicting an upset, Bangladesh have reason to believe. But to be at the receiving end of one tomorrow will be a slip-up that will leave them an endangered species in Group B. #p#Form guide (completed matches, most recent first) Bangladesh : WLWLW Netherlands : LLLLL #p#Watch out for... #p#In two games in which they'll back themselves strongly, Netherlands will need their best player, Ryan ten Doeschate , to step up. They were able to push England close, thanks largely to his outstanding all-round effort but have withered away since then. He's managed scores of 7, 11 and 11 in their last three games but what better way to crash a party and leave the hosts deflated than a repeat of what he achieved in Netherlands' first game this tournament. #p#Bangladesh's spinners had England in a tangle with 33 overs shared between the four slow bowlers. They picked up seven wickets for 140, though were countered with the enterprise of Eoin Morgan. In favourable conditions where footwork and innovativeness will be key to tackling slow bowling, Netherlands' lack of experience remains a major weakness the Bangladesh spinners can exploit. #p#Team news #p#Bangladesh are contemplating bringing in Suhrawadi Shuvo, a left-arm spinner, into the XI, potentially at the expense of offspinner Naeem Islam, who impressed against England in a tidy spell. "We are looking at bringing Shuvo in to add another left-arm spinner, they have got a lot of right-handers in their team," Siddons said. "It will make very difficult for them if we put another left-armer in. We are thinking of shifting Naeem and Shuvo, but we haven't really confirmed that. It will be difficult on Naeem to drop him, rather leave him out, not drop him." #p#Bangladesh (possible): 1 Tamim Iqbal, 2 Imrul Kayes, 3 Junaid Siddique, 4 Raqibul Hasan, 5 Shakib Al Hasan (capt), 6 Mushfiqur Rahim (wk), 7 Mahmudullah, 8 Suhrawadi Shuvo/ Naeem Islam, 9 Abdur Razzak, 10 Shafiul islam, 11 Rubel Hossain. #p#Netherlands (possible): 1 Eric Szwaraczynski, 2 Wesley Barresi (wk), 3 Tom Cooper, 4 Ryan ten Doeschate, 5 Alexei Kervezee, 6 Bas Zuiderent, 7 Tom de Grooth, 8 Peter Borren (capt), 9 Bradley Kruger, 10 Mudassar Bukhari, 11 Pieter Seelaar. #p#Pitch and conditions Conditions are likely to remain overcast and the pitch is expected to play in a similar fashion to how it did in the England game. Being a day game, dew is unlikely to be a factor and as the track could open up later in the day, batting first is a preferred option. #p#Stats and trivia Netherlands and Bangladesh have played each other in just one ODI, in Glasgow last year, and in conditions radically different from what Chittagong will offer. Netherlands won that game by six wickets #p#Netherlands have no left-handed batsmen in their 15-man squad. Bangladesh have seven. #p#Quotes "It's always pressure when you are expected to win. It's not unusual for us. We have got a really good record against lower-ranked teams, we have also got a few hiccups along the way as well, but we are confident. We got over Ireland, just had a great win over England, so we are confident. Hopefully we can do the job." Jamie Siddons #p#"Definitely it will be our intention to ruin the party for them. It is good that our games against Bangladesh and Ireland have a bearing on the tournament. It's just great that we can go out there and play a match that still counts." Peter Borren
32	506090		The day Bangladesh made Greenidge cry for joy	Sidharth Monga in Chittagong	March 13, 2011	Akram Khan is regarded by many as the best Bangladesh batsman ever Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Features : The Khans of Chittagong Players/Officials: Akram Khan Matches: Bangladesh v Netherlands at Chittagong | Bangladesh v Netherlands at Kuala Lumpur | Bangladesh v Netherlands at Nairobi (Prem) Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Bangladesh | Netherlands #p#"Gordon Greenidge cried the most. Everybody was crying, he couldn't hold himself back." #p#Bangladesh and Netherlands might have played each other only once in international cricket - in Glasgow at that - but they share a bittersweet history; a history of tears of anguish and tears of joy for Bangladesh. Back in 1994, and then in 1997, the two countries were involved in two matches, which though not recognised as internationals, were key to the future of cricket in Bangladesh. Those were in the days of the ICC Trophy, where the Associates take part in tense contests - a tension followers of Test-playing nations can never truly appreciate, and that includes me - just to make it to the World Cup. Just to let the world know they exist. #p#Akram Khan, arguably the greatest entertainer to play for Bangladesh, was involved in both those seminal matches against Netherlands. He is a national selector now, and often comes to watch the Bangladesh nets. On his way to the ground on Sunday, on the eve of a crucial match against Netherlands, all he could think of was those two emotion-filled games - emotion that perhaps surpasses what we have seen in Bangladesh this World Cup. #p#In Nairobi in 1994, Bangladesh had restricted Netherlands to 205. Understandably, the coach, Mohinder Amarnath, then told them not to take any risks while chasing and just to knock the runs down. Bangladesh took the advice too seriously, as Akram remembers, and it turned out to be " choddo over, baro run [fourteen overs, 12 runs]." It sounds funny now, but it was a huge setback. Bangladesh ended up losing by 47 runs. #p#Zimbabwe had been granted Test status, thus opening up another slot among the Associates for the first large World Cup, to be played in 1996. Three teams were to qualify from the ICC Trophy, and Bangladesh were the favourites. Thanks to that defeat, though, Netherlands usurped Bangladesh. #p#Akram and Bangladesh were inconsolable then. " Bahut takleef hua tha [It hurt us a lot]," he says, "that we didn't qualify for the 1996 World Cup. We had got all sorts of help from India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. They all helped us with the infrastructure and facilities. They used to send A teams. We thought we had let them down, our country down, everybody down." #p#Three years later Bangladesh went into another ICC Trophy, this time in Kuala Lumpur, as the favourites. They had a strong side, so strong they played the same XI throughout the tournament. The matches were covered live on radio, and the whole nation was hooked. They went unbeaten through the tournament, but rain was cruel to them. When they had bowled Ireland out for 129 in a league game, they had to settle for shared points because of rain. That left them in a must-win situation in their last league game against Netherlands at the Rubber Research Institute in Kuala Lumpur. #p#Bangladesh bowled Netherlands out for 171, and they were just one solid chase short of going through to the semi-finals. However, after having gone unbeaten for seven games, they found themselves at 15 for 4. The dream was crashing. This would be too big a heartbreak. The rain arrived again, this time as the saviour. Or so it seemed at that point. #p#Akram and Minhajul Abedin then put together a partnership. Abedin, a wristy batsman, also came from Chittagong, like Akram. The two street-smart cricketers not only got runs, they indulged in some time wasting too: asking for a helmet during an over, fiddling with other equipment, doing whatever they could to delay things. Arguments ensued. Akram now smiles and says, "I did some bad things. Not good." #p#"We thought if we got away with one point from that game, we would qualify for the semi-final," Akram says. "But when we came back, the match referee told us we had to win the game. We were stunned." #p#This is where emotion makes the story hazy. All the journalists, the team themselves, and the fans present there, agree with this version: that when Bangladesh came off they thought a draw would be enough, but learned to their horror that nothing less than a win would do. #p#That does not sound entirely accurate because Bangladesh went into that game with three points and Netherlands with one. Ireland had already qualified with five points. So a no-result would have taken Bangladesh to four and Netherlands would have been stuck at two. A defeat for Bangladesh, though, would have tied Netherlands at three points, in which case Netherlands would have advanced based on the head-to-head. #p#There are two plausible explanations for the delaying tactics Bangladesh employed and the celebrations that greeted the rain. Bangladesh may have realised that with the partnership between Akram and Abedin, they were ahead of the Duckworth-Lewis par score, and by slowing the game down they were just ensuring that lead. However, just before they came off, Abedin was run out, which could have pushed them just behind on the reckoning, which would have meant they would lose if no further play was possible. #p#Also D/L was a new beast back then, and perhaps Bangladesh didn't realise they had already played the minimum number of overs required to constitute a game and were now going to lose. #p#Then again, perhaps the version accepted in Bangladesh is correct, and this conjecture is merely conjecture. It's all trivial, though. What is important is that the whole of Bangladesh, glued to the radio, was praying for rain, and once it stopped play, they celebrated. #p#Bangladesh ended up winning the 1997 ICC Trophy Simon King / ESPNcricinfo Ltd Enlarge #p#Then came the news that this wasn't good enough for them to qualify. The news was relayed on radio. Everybody who prayed for rain was now praying for the resumption of the game. "We worried about our futures," Akram says. "All negative thoughts came to our mind. The failure in 1994. And now we thought we might never be able to play international cricket. #p#" Woh jumme ka din tha [It was a Friday]. A lot of Bengalis come to work in Malaysia. They all turned up at the ground. Everybody started praying. Luckily the rain stopped and the play resumed and we had a revised target." #p#Akram then produced an innings on which Bangladesh cricket stands today, as anybody in the country will tell you. Those who were present there say it was a chanceless innings, with no sense of panic or hurry. "I believed if I stayed there till the end, we would win this," Akram says. "Nannu [Abedin] was a vital player. He had performed well in domestic cricket, and I got a partnership with him and then one with Saiful Islam. In the end I stayed not out." #p#That kicked off wild celebrations. Athar Ali Khan, who opened the batting in that game, says it was the same as what we have seen on the streets of Dhaka and Chittagong this year after the national team's wins over England and Ireland. "My body was draped in the Bangladesh national flag, and we didn't leave the ground for a long, long time." #p#Akram says everybody cried that day. The journalists, and their friends, say they cried too. "Gordon [Greenidge, their coach] cried the most. Everybody was crying, he couldn't hold himself back." #p#Gordon Greenidge crying. Just imagine a win that makes Greenidge cry; a man who had come from a different country, a different culture. The owner of one of the fiercest square-cuts ever seen, the man with the double-century on one leg, the man whose image first comes to mind when the words "beware the wounded batsman" are said; Greenidge cried after that win. That's how much it meant to the team. #p#I ask Akram if he agrees with what everyone tells me. Was this the single most important innings in the history of Bangladesh cricket? He pauses. Says yes. Then laughs. Says yes again. It cannot be denied. For because of that innings, Bangladesh played the semi-final, then the final, then the World Cup, where they beat Pakistan and got Test status. If they had lost on that jumme ka din , there would have been no World Cup, and who knows how long they would have had to wait to qualify for a World Cup. #p#We all talk about the pressure of expectation on the current team, but at least they know they will be playing international cricket even if they lose. They knew they would be playing international cricket even when they went 47 games without a win. The class of 1997, though, even after having gone unbeaten in that tournament until then, didn't know if they would ever get to play if they lost that day. It wasn't quite a Messerschmitt up the arse, but surely Keith Miller wouldn't have scoffed if Akram told him he was under pressure that day.
32	506106	Bangladesh v Netherlands, Group B, World Cup 2011, Chittagong	Kayes improves quarter-final chances	The Bulletin by Sriram Veera	March 14, 2011	#p#Bangladesh 166 for 4 (Kayes 73*) beat Netherlands 160 (ten Doeschate 53*, Razzak 3-29) by six wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details #p#Shafiul Islam's tight but luckless opening spell set the tone for Bangladesh's victory Getty Images Enlarge Related Links News : Borren rues dot balls and run-outs News : Shakib hails Shafiul as key Matches: Bangladesh v Netherlands at Chittagong Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Bangladesh | Netherlands #p#The ball didn't turn much on a slow pitch in Chittagong but Netherlands' batsmen didn't have the skill to handle the nagging line and length from the battery of Bangladesh's left-arm spinners. They stabbed, plodded and meandered to 160 and Bangladesh wrapped up a six-wicket victory in a virtual must-win match. Shafiul Islam was luckless in a probing opening spell that read 6-3-7-0 but he was instrumental in strangling the Netherlands batsmen before the spinners tightened the screws further. The result escalated the pressure on England, who have to beat West Indies to stay in the World Cup. #p#For a brief while, 6.5 overs to be precise, there was some fight in the chase but it evaporated as Imrul Kayes took control to push Bangladesh to victory in Chittagong. Bangladesh were on a wobbly 14 for 1, for the loss of Tamim Iqbal, in the seventh over but Junaid Siddique and Kayes broke free to force Netherlands out of the contest. #p#The total was too meagre to defend and it was due their middling effort with the bat that Netherlands lost this game. Whenever they tried to take initiative, as Tom Cooper and Alexei Kervezee did, it proved just a mirage as they got out immediately. Whenever they tried to steal some quick runs, they got involved in run-outs. Cooper had struck Shakib Al Hasan for two fours in the 25th over but he got out in the next over, run out due to a misunderstanding with Eric Szwarczynski. He rushed across for a single after pushing to point but couldn't get back in time despite a wide throw from Shakib. Mushfiqur Rahim collected and swiveled to flick a direct hit. Kervezee crashed Smart Stats Abdur Razzak's 3 for 29 is his third three-wicket haul in World Cups. He has been involved in three of the top five World Cup bowling performances for Bangladesh. The 92-run stand between Imrul Kayes and Junaid Siddique is the highest for the second wicket for Bangladesh in World Cups. The previous highest was 73 between Tamim Iqbal and Siddique against India in the first game of the 2011 World Cup. Kayes' 73 is the second-highest score by a Bangladesh batsman in World Cups behind Mohammad Ashraful's 87 against South Africa in 2007. The win was Bangladesh's fourth against a non Test-playing nation in World Cups. Overall, they have won 50 and lost 33 matches against non Test-playing teams (including Zimbabwe). Against Test-playing teams however, they have won 17 and lost 141 ODIs. Netherlands' score of 160 is their fourth score below 200 in the 2011 World Cup and their eighth such score in World Cups. During the course of his half-century, Ryan ten Doeschate became the highest run getter for Netherlands in World Cups. He now has 329 runs at an average of 54.83. Rubel Hossain for two fours in the 33rd over but fell in the next, stumped off the bowling of Suhrawadi Shuvo. To add to their woes, four batsmen ran themselves out on a day when nothing went right for the Associate team. #p#Szwarczynski, the opener, dawdled for 68 balls but couldn't convert the start into anything meaningful. Ryan ten Doeschate, dropped on 14 by Kayes, hung around for an unbeaten fifty but he lacked support. The innings lacked momentum from the start, after Shafiul's inspired opening spell, and it went nowhere in the end. #p#It will remain a mystery how Shafiul didn't pick up a wicket. He darted the ball in, straightened it outside off, slipped in yorkers, tried faster and slower bouncers and didn't bowl a bad ball. He harassed the openers with movement but the ball either thudded high on the pad or missed the edge. It was one of those days. The first run off him was scored only in the 18th delivery, when he tried a slower one. Netherlands promoted Mudassar Bukhari to pinch some quick runs but Shafiul put him in his place in the 11th over. Two yorkers jammed the bottom of the bat, a bouncer pinged the shoulder and a slower one beat the waft. #p#Shafiul paved way for the spinners, Abdur Razzak, Shakib and Shuvo, who did what they normally do: hit a tight line and length, bowl a slew of dot balls, increase the pressure, and make the batsmen feel claustrophobic. Everything went according to their script. #p#Netherlands had a brief moment of joy in the chase when Bukhari breached the defences of Tamim with a delivery that straightened in the first over. He continued to bowl with heart, showed some skill and even sledged. He went past Kayes' bat a few times and gave lip to Siddique, but just when the contest looked interesting, Bangladesh broke free. #p#It was the final ball of the seventh over and Siddique had just been sledged after Bukhari banged in a short delivery. Siddique responded with a flamboyant pull to collect a boundary and that was the moment that turned things around for Bangladesh. In the next over, he dragged the offspinner Adeel Raja, who opened with Bukhari and bowled a few tight overs, to the square-leg boundary. Soon Kayes, who was on 9 off 24 balls, pulled Raja for three runs and Bangladesh took control. #p#Post that, Kayes took ownership of the chase and started to roll out the big shots: he slapped Raja through covers, slashed a full toss from ten Doeschate over point, and drove Peter Borren through cover for successive boundaries in the 17th over. Though Siddique and Shahriar Nafees, who made a fluent 37 in his first game of the tournament, fell and Shakib combusted on arrival, Kayes stayed to finish the job. #p#Match Timeline
32	506160	Bangladesh v Netherlands, World Cup 2011, Group B, Chittagong	Shafiul's misfortune and Razzak's imploring appeal	Sidharth Monga in Chittagong	March 14, 2011	Mushfiqur Rahim: Vocal behind the stumps, nifty in front Associated Press Enlarge Related Links Matches: Bangladesh v Netherlands at Chittagong Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Bangladesh | Netherlands #p#The run-out Bowlers' deflection onto the stumps at the non-striker's end seemed to be the favourite mode of run-out today. In the 15th over of the Netherlands innings, when Eric Szwarczynski pushed Abdur Razzak back down the ground, the bowler got a finger on it, only to find that Tom Cooper, the non-striker was already home. In the 23rd over, though, when Cooper returned Szwarczynski the favour, the latter could not make it back. #p#The amend Mushfiqur Rahim dropped Cooper's sitter off Rubel Hossain, and considering the free-flowing start Cooper made to his innings, it seemed it might cost Bangladesh as much as the Eoin Morgan reprieve did the other day. Today, though, Mushfiqur got a second chance when Cooper was short by a mile, but Shakib threw a wild return from point. He was down on his knees and around the good-length area on the pitch when he collected the throw, but from there he flicked it on to catch Cooper short. #p#The appeal In the 46th over, Razzak got so immersed in appealing for an lbw that Ryan ten Doeschate stole a leg-bye by the time the appeal finished. When Razzak finished the appeal, he looked up to find the ball at his feet. To make a point, he even implored Shakib into going for a review, only to find the ball kissing the outside of the leg stump. #p#The misfortune Shafiul Islam kept moving the ball consistently in his first spell, mixed in the yorkers, and the bouncers of both varieties. Still he couldn't get a wicket: he often missed the edge; when he hit the pad, it would be too high. The first spell made for impressive reading, 6-3-7-0, but the wickets column remained blank. When he came back at the death, Shafiul would have thought he had finally got his wicket when ten Doeschate hit him straight to deep square leg. Razzak, however, dropped it. Some things are not meant to be. #p#The indecision When ten Doeschate was dropped in the above-mentioned instance, he was batting with the No. 11, and that being the first ball of the over, he wanted to retain the strike. So he called Adeel Raja back when he was about to touch down at the other end. The strike was successfully retained. ten Doeschate drove the next ball towards extra cover, and instinctively set off to run, expecting the ball to get through the inner ring. Then he saw the ball stopped at the edge of the circle, and realised all he could manage was a single, and decided to call Raja back. Then he realised it was too late. Then he thought maybe it wasn't. Finally they decided to go back to their original ends, but it was too late even despite the slow throw.
32	506212	Bangladesh v Netherlands, Group B, World Cup 2011, Chittagong	Borren rues dot balls and run-outs	Sidharth Monga in Chittagong	March 14, 2011	#p#There is an image that kept repeating itself, and summed up Netherlands' game today. Their batsmen often found the length and width to cut, but kept hitting the ball in front of square, to cover-point. It resulted in a statistic that sums up their game: 185 dot balls out of the 278 they faced. In their first game of the tournament, when Netherlands scored 292 against England they faced 150 dot balls out of 305. Not only did they not last their full 50 overs, Netherlands scored off 35 balls fewer. #p#It wasn't easy for Netherlands. They were playing in Bangladesh for the first time, and no matter how much training you do on tailored pitches, batting on such slow tracks against pretty accurate and smart spinners is tough. More often than not, you don't succeed in your first attempt, as Netherlands found out. They tried to manufacture shots against the seam bowlers when the ball was new and hard and the fields up. They even sent in a pinch hitter at the fall of the first wicket. It didn't work. #p#"Our ratio between runs and dot balls, and singles and boundaries was too low today," Peter Borren, their captain, said. "We need to rotate the strike better. It is difficult here in these conditions, on this wicket, against the spinners, not as easy to rotate the strike as what we normally find. So this is something we have really tried hard to work on, and we came out short today. #p#"It's hard to practise for those conditions that we came out against today. Three left-arm spinners on a very, very slow wicket, trying to rotate the strike - I think the guys found it difficult, and if guys get in, they find it a little easier. It's always difficult to start with. Once you are in, it's easier. Today we got in a little bit, and then got out. Struggled to rotate the strike a bit." #p#The steady loss of wickets denied Ryan ten Doeschate the opportunity to take the batting Powerplay earlier than the 44th over Getty Images Enlarge #p#Netherlands let themselves down with four run-outs and batsmen not converting starts into big scores. They would find it hard to blame themselves for two of those run-outs. One was a deflection off the bowler's hand onto the non-striker's stumps, and the other came out of confusion, with Ryan ten Doeschate trying to farm the strike with the No. 11. #p#"What happens is it takes time to get in against the spinners on slow wickets," Borren said. "It takes a little bit of getting used to. Today, every time we looked like getting a little bit used to it, we lost a wicket. Four run-outs, which was pretty crucial. It was hard work, the wicket was hard with their bowlers." #p#The regular fall of wickets meant Netherlands could never really use the batting Powerplay. On the face, it might have seemed ten Doeschate missed a trick by not calling for the Powerplay earlier than he eventually did, in the 44th over with nine wickets down, but to be fair to him there never were two batsmen set enough to utilise it. It could be argued that big batsmen take the risk and the responsibility alone in these situations, but perhaps the need to last the full 50 overs played on ten Doeschate's mind. He stayed unbeaten on 53. #p#"We kept losing wickets at crucial times," Borren said. "You try and form a partnership between a couple of guys so they are both comfortable, and then you might take the Powerplay. We left the Powerplay till too late, we were nine down when we took it. The reason we didn't take it earlier was, we were trying to build partnerships, and just kept failing to do that. Run-outs, a couple of poor dismissals - four run-outs, it's pretty criminal at this level, and something we are really disappointed with."
32	506222	Bang v Netherlands, World Cup 2011, Chittagong	Shakib hails Shafiul as key	Sidharth Monga in Chittagong	March 14, 2011	#p#The most pleasing aspect of Monday's win for Bangladesh will be that they did what was expected of them. That can't be said of the first four games, but on Monday they came out against a lower-ranked team and professionally and solidly fashioned a facile win that keeps them alive in the tournament. Bangladesh might have lost to Netherlands in their only international before this, but at home, on a slow and low pitch, they were strong favourites, and demonstrated just why. However, even on this track, the best fast bowler on display was wearing green and red, and that was impressive too. #p#Two men, though, stood out more than the others in what was a good team effort. Again it will please Bangladesh that they are the two same men that were a notch above the others in their win against England. Imrul Kayes again came up with a level-headed fifty to anchor the chase, and Shafiul Islam, on a slow pitch, produced a performance that yielded no wickets, but might have got him a four-for some other day. #p#Despite the lack of wickets, Shafiul's contribution was not lost on either of the captains. What made his first spell of 6-3-7-0, more than the number of edges he missed out on, was that the batsmen were targeting him while the ball was hard and coming on. Yet they probably felt lucky they didn't lose any wickets to him. #p#"In his first spell, he got nice away swing," Peter Borren, Netherlands' captain, said of him. "He didn't bowl a bad ball pretty much the whole day. He was pretty consistent. We were looking to kind of attack the seamers at the start because we thought that might be our opportunity to score a little bit, in the Powerplay against the hard ball with some pace on the ball, but to be honest he didn't allow us to do that. He bowled really nicely today, and credit to him for giving nothing away. He didn't go for many runs, and he probably deserved more wickets than he got." #p#Imrul Kayes got his second consecutive Man-of-the-Match award Getty Images Enlarge #p#Shakib Al Hasan was full of praise too. "The first two matches we won were both due to massive contributions from Shafiul," he said. "He delivered at crucial moments. Today also he did very well with the new ball, and even later in the innings. I think he has learnt a lot from the India match, which he is being able to apply now. And that is giving him the confidence that he can be a world-class bowler." #p#Shafiul's good work was followed up on by the trio of left-arm spinners, and then after Tamim Iqbal's dismissal in the first over, Kayes played the kind of innings that soothes nerves in the dressing room. No loose shots, no hurry to get to the target. When he won the Man-of-the-Match award for a pretty similar effort against England, he pointed out that it was his first match award. Three days later he has now emulated Manjural Islam Rana as the only Bangladesh player with consecutive match awards in ODIs. #p#Last time, Kayes also pointed out that Shafiul actually deserved the award, but today he was there at the end, unbeaten, and there was no doubt as to who the Man of the Match should be. "The last match Man-of-the-Match award was given to me but I did not deserve it. It was Shafiul who should have got it," he said. "But this match I played well and was unbeaten. I had not won a Man-of-the-Match award before these two, so getting this today makes me very happy. #p#"I think the wicket was not good to bat on. When Tamim got out I was constantly talking to Junaid [Siddique]. The main thing was when Junaid hit a good ball, I thought if I stayed at the wicket I would be successful." #p#Shakib said of Kayes' innings: "Last match he batted really well, but in this match he had to struggle a bit because of the wicket, which was not allowing us to play shots. He stuck around and did the right thing." #p#This was the best Bangladesh could have done in terms of the result from this game, for the net run-rate situation is beyond their control. They are so far behind West Indies and Ireland, the teams they can end up tied with, that it is near impossible to beat their run-rates. A lot now depends on the result of the match between England and West Indies, but Shakib continues to remain positive. "It is in our hands too," he said. "If we win the next match [against South Africa] we will get to the quarter-finals. It is as simple as that."

Add a charismatic leader in inspirational form and the echoes of 1992 had their fans dreaming. But then, on their last outing in Pallekele, Pakistan's enchanting instinct for implosion returned spectacularly as they tumbled to a 110-run defeat to New Zealand. #p#Kamran Akmal's incompetence enraged all but his blindest supporters and allowed Ross Taylor to flog 114 off a shambolic final six overs of the innings. Just as it looked as though his time had surely past, Pakistan's team management stood firmly behind Kamran, and his younger brother Umar - the only alternative behind the stumps - picked up a finger injury. There are doubts over whether Umar will play, even just as a batsman, which would deprive Pakistan of their second-highest run-scorer in the tournament and means they are likely to persist with the eight-batsman strategy. Up against a Zimbabwe side that has failed to match the scrapping resilience of some of their past World Cup outfits, Pakistan can expect an immediate revival in their fortunes. A win would take them to eight points, level with New Zealand in the Group A table. #p#Meanwhile, the wave optimism surrounding Zimbabwe in the lead-up to the tournament has been dashed by a series of heavy defeats. Until Sri Lanka gifted a clutch of late-over wickets, Zimbabwe had gone 78.1 overs and given away 448 runs without taking a wicket across their two defeats to New Zealand and Sri Lanka. Their decision to play two specialist seamers against Sri Lanka was at odds with the spin-heavy strategy that had underpinned their progress over recent months, but perhaps betrayed the lack of confidence in captain Elton Chigumbura. Since taking over as leader 18 matches ago he taken only two wickets, at 158 each, and his batting too has fallen: averaging 17.57 in that period. A naturally free-spirited player, the burdens of leadership haven't sat comfortably and his team might be better off allowing him back to the ranks soon. #p#Form guide (completed matches, most recent first) Pakistan LWWWL Zimbabwe LLWLL #p#Watch out for... Among the carnage that was Pakistan's fielding effort against New Zealand, Umar Gul stood out. Finding swing first up and reverse swing later he carries the seam attack. Lasith Malinga and Kemar Roach have shown that the lesser teams are vulnerable to a tirade of yorkers and, when on song, nobody is as skilled at delivering them as Gul. #p#Brendan Taylor has provided the iconic shot of a lacklustre Group A with his take on the upper cut. In the first World Cup since the Twenty20 revolution really took hold, it displays the huge challenges facing modern bowlers. Outside of that, his classic, upright driving a tight defence make him Zimbabwe's best player, and for a while against Sri Lanka he looked as good as any top-order batsman in the tournament. Pakistan's bowlers have folded under the pressure of a Taylor before and if Brendan can get going Zimbabwe may yet spring a surprise. #p#Team news If Umar Akmal misses out, there is a likely recall for Asad Shafiq while Ahmed Shehzad can expect to hold his place despite making 36 runs from his four outings. Shoaib Akhtar's woeful effort against New Zealand will prompt calls for Wahab Riaz's inclusion. #p#Pakistan (probable) 1 Ahmed Shehzad, 2 Mohammad Hafeez, 3 Kamran Akmal (wk), 4 Younis Khan, 5 Misbah-ul-Haq, 6 Asad Shafiq/ Umar Akmal, 7 Shahid Afridi, 8 Abdul Razzaq, 9 Wahab Riaz, 10 Saeed Ajmal, 11 Umar Gul. #p#Regis Chakabva's entry to the top of the order provided a perfect foil for Taylor against Sri Lanka as the pair added 116 within the first 20 overs, so with his position fixed the main change could come with dropping Tinashe Panyangara, who conceded 51 from six wicketless overs and recalling Charles Coventry to slot into the middle order where he has had success in the past. #p#Zimbabwe (probable) 1 Brendan Taylor, 2 Regis Chakabva, 3 Tatenda Taibu (wk), 4 Craig Ervine, 5 Elton Chigumbura (capt), 6 Charles Coventry, 7 Greg Lamb, 8 Prosper Utseya, 9 Graeme Cremer, 10 Ray Price, 11 Chris Mpofu. #p#Pitch and conditions Pallekelle has not quite matched Bangalore for gratuitous run-fests but has certainly aided the batsmen in its few games so far. Ross Taylor found the boundaries small enough to clear seven times in his unbeaten 131 against Pakistan and Sri Lanka coasted to 327 against Zimbabwe last Thursday. It's harder for the team batting second under lights, so the toss is important. #p#Stats In four World Cup meetings between the sides Pakistan have won three with the Bulawayo tie in 2003 being rained off #p#The 349 Pakistan made against Zimbabwe in Kingston in 2007 is their highest World Cup score #p#In 40 matches between the sides Pakistan have only lost twice, the last time being 13 years ago #p#Quotes #p#"I feel I have done my preparation and it's just a matter of executing my skills" Brendan Taylor's pre-match words are as well-drilled as anyone else in the world
33	506079	New Zealand v Pakistan, Group A, World Cup 2011, Pallekele	Afridi says Umar is fit and will play	Osman Samiuddin in Pallekele	March 13, 2011	#p#Pakistan may be keen to stick to as stable an XI as possible as they go through the group stages of this tournament, but it doesn't seem likely they will be able to do so. They take on Zimbabwe in a potentially tricky encounter, in a vital game in Pallekele, knowing that a win will ensure a quarter-final berth for them. #p#But in the aftermath of last week's loss to New Zealand, their preparations have been hampered by a re-enactment of the Akmal brothers saga, seen for the first time in Australia early last year. The younger, Umar, injured his finger in fielding practice forcing him to sit out practice over the last couple of days. It also ruled him out as a replacement for Kamran as wicketkeeper, an option that was being considered in light of Kamran's costly, error-ridden hand against New Zealand. #p#The team was forced to deny that Umar was faking his injury in order to keep Kamran in the side, a situation that reportedly occurred - with a twist - after the Sydney Test last year. The uncertainty over Umar's availability has only deepened over the last two days. There is no fracture in his right index finger but he hasn't batted and he only began fielding on Sunday. To complicate matters further, he took a knock on his left ankle during a session of football on Sunday morning, though that isn't thought to be serious. #p#Shahid Afridi sounded confident about Umar's availability, though noises from the rest of the camp are not as positive. If Umar does not play, Asad Shafiq is likely to be the replacement. "Umar is fit, it is a light injury," Afridi said. "He was fielding just now and looking better. He is fine and definitely inshallah he will play tomorrow." #p#All the confusion makes one thing clear: Kamran will be in, for lack of a credible alternative if nothing else. All week the team has made reassuring noises about his wicketkeeping, about how hard he has worked and trained. #p#Shahid Afrid has backed Kamran Akmal, saying he has been working hard on his keeping AFP Enlarge #p#"His performance in batting hasn't been bad but yes he is struggling with his keeping," Afridi said. "But he is working very hard, you've seen it. We also haven't got such an option in the squad to whom we can give a chance in this tournament. It's been four days, he's working hard, he has support and our confidence, he is a better choice. I think he knows the mistakes he has committed and he will try to make up for it for sure." #p#Another change Pakistan are likely to make is to rest Shoaib Akhtar, who gave away 71 runs in his nine overs against New Zealand, and bring in Wahab Riaz. #p#Afridi is treading that fine line, currently, that all captains must at one point or another: to stick with struggling players and give them confidence in the name of stability, or bring in change for the sake of improvement. The matter is at its most acute with the openers Ahmed Shehzad and Mohammad Hafeez, both of whom have flopped with the bat. He doesn't want to experiment much, but he knows Pakistan can ill-afford more poor starts. #p#"I'm not trying to experiment as this is not the right time. I am trying to give confidence to everyone. During the competition we are trying to keep the same momentum and team with just one or two changes. At the moment the openers are thinking let's play 15 overs but don't lose wickets but also they are thinking let's play our positive games. I've told them play to your strengths, like you play in domestic cricket, play like that. #p#"Over the last couple of days they've worked really hard and the coaches have worked hard with them as well. I am confident they will perform." #p#Pakistan were unconvincing in the win against Canada in Colombo and fell apart against New Zealand, so Afridi hoped that they can get their campaign back on track. "We learnt a lot from that loss because we didn't perform well in the field, with the ball or bat. We should be more focused on the way we are going to start with the bat, the way we bowl with the new ball. We need the kind of good start we got against Sri Lanka. We'll try to put a decent total on the board and defend it and get them out as soon as possible."
33	506082	Pakistan v Zimbabwe, World Cup 2011, Group A, Pallekele	Lack of Tests affecting batting - Butcher	ESPNcricinfo staff	March 13, 2011	#p#Zimbabwe's batting woes in the World Cup are a consequence of the team not having played Tests in a long time, the national coach Alan Butcher has said. Zimbabwe have gone past 200 just once in four matches this tournament, and that effort came against minnows Canada. #p#"You get used to batting for longer period of times in Test cricket and that does relate to one-day cricket as well," Butcher told reporters on the eve of Zimbabwe's Group A clash against Pakistan in Pallekele. "Your top four players want to bat for the majority of the innings in a one-day game; they may have had the opportunity to bat for a day and a half in Test matches." #p#Zimbabwe have been in self-imposed isolation from Test cricket since 2006, when they didn't have the players to field a competitive team. However, late last year, the country's cricket board laid out an 18-month plan to return to the Test fold. #p#Butcher said Zimbabwe would have to look for newer talent if the trend of low scores continued. "I hope that eventually another couple of players will show that ability, because if they don't we have to find new players rather than continue with those who give us 170 totals." #p#Zimbabwe have gone past 200 just once in this World Cup AFP Enlarge #p#Zimbabwe, who've lost three of their four games, have the ability to cause an upset, Butcher said. While the batting has been a problem, he believed the team had a bowling attack capable of defending a score in the range of 250. "I think the concern is to put a positive total on the board and that's what's been our problem. The minimum realistic target is 250 and if we score that then we have a chance against most teams." #p#Butcher also backed captain Elton Chigumbura, who's had a poor run this tournament in the middle order, to recover. "I'm not sure whether the captaincy is weighing on him. He keeps practising, keeps trying to work hard, trying to turn things around. He has got the ability and is working on some technical issues and hopefully they will pay dividends."

33	506178	Pakistan v Zimbabwe, World Cup 2011, Group A, Pallekele	Pakistan bowlers seal quarter-final qualification	The Report by Sahil Dutta	March 14, 2011	#p#Pakistan 164 for 3 (Shafiq 78*, Hafeez 49, Price 2-21) beat Zimbabwe 151 for 7 (39.4 ov) (Ervine 52, Chigumbura 32*, Gul 3-36) by seven wickets (D/L method) Scorecard and ball-by-ball details #p#Umar Gul was Man of the Match for his three wickets Associated Press Enlarge Related Links Analysis : 'Slave to rhythm' Gul tunes in to top form News : Batting remains Zimbabwe's biggest weakness Players/Officials: Kamran Akmal | Umar Akmal Matches: Pakistan v Zimbabwe at Pallekele Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Pakistan | Zimbabwe #p#Pakistan made the most of Elton Chigumbura's generous offer to bat first to secure a seven-wicket victory in a rain-reduced fixture at Pallekele and rubber-stamp their quarter-final place. The dank skies delivered two huge downpours that meant Duckworth-Lewis made its first appearance of the tournament in another one-sided Group A fixture. #p#With the damp pitch and heavy cloud cover Pallekele resembled an early-spring Headingley and Pakistan's bowlers thrived in the helpful conditions. They entered the game on the back of a 110-run hammering on the same ground by New Zealand, but rediscovered their focus to reduce Zimbabwe to 157 for 7 when a second rain delay brought a premature end to the innings. Asad Shafiq then helped himself to an unbeaten 78 in his first World Cup match to steer Pakistan to an easy victory. #p#Shoaib Akhtar was dropped after his shambolic showing in the previous match and, having struggled for new-ball scalps through the tournament, the opening pair of Umar Gul and Abdul Razzaq made three inroads in the first six overs which set the tone for the remainder of the day. #p#Razzaq, who was flogged for 49 in four overs against New Zealand, landed the key blow in the first over when he had Brendan Taylor caught behind for 5. Taylor would be forgiven for thinking himself unlucky because it was Pakistan's calamitous wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal who held chance. Kamran had put down an almost identical one off Ross Taylor last Tuesday but here, to the palpable relief of all his team-mates, he made no mistake. #p#If that was impressive enough, Misbah-ul-Haq's catch at slip to remove Vusi Sibanda, demonstrated a rare sharpness in the field as he moved swiftly to his right to pluck the sharp chance out the air. With the ball darting around and Gul generating good pace it looked as though Zimbabwe would subside swiftly, but Craig Ervine resisted with a gutsy half-century, finding support from Greg Lamb and later Chigumbura, who made his second-highest score in 19 matches as captain with an unbeaten 32. #p#Ervine was the most assured of the Zimbabwe players but was gifted a life on 13 when Misbah undid his earlier good work by fluffing a simple chance off Razzaq. The dark clouds had threatened all afternoon and finally let rip in the 28th over with a tropical downpour. On most grounds it would have been enough to end proceedings for the day, but a collection of huge covers and an army of groundstaff combined to get the entire outfield protected and play resumed after 90 minutes. #p#The delay freshened up an already sprightly surface and Ervine fell five balls after completing his fifty. It left Chigumbura to try and atone for his earlier decision to bat and he was looking in good order when rain returned to close the innings prematurely, setting a modest target of 162 from 38 overs. #p#Pakistan laboured somewhat early on in a straightforward chase before Shafiq took control. Ahmed Shehzad's miserable tournament continued when he ran past a flighted Ray Price delivery to fall for 8. He now has a highest score of 13 from five knocks this World Cup which, after starring in Pakistan's 3-2 series victory in New Zealand that preceded the tournament, is a major disappointment. #p#Instead it was his Mohammad Hafeez who steadied the early innings with 49. After Hafeez fell, Shahid Afridi promoted himself up the order but his search for batting form continued as he landed a couple of sweeps before missing a cut to give an ecstatic Price his second wicket #p#Shafiq, in the side head of Umar Akmal, began very quietly and had 5 from 26 deliveries before finding the boundary for the first time. He added 41 from his next 49 balls to bring up a composed half-century and ensure no alarms. #p#After Afridi's predictable blow-out Younis Khan partnered Shafiq to guide Pakistan over the line and into the quarter-finals with a 54-run stand. It means Group A's qualifiers are settled and the ICC can only be thankful Group B has been exciting enough to keep the elongated opening phase interesting. #p#Match Timeline
33	506257	Pakistan v Zimbabwe, Group A, World Cup 2011, Pallekele	Pakistan's left-arm spinner bogey	Osman Samiuddin in Pallekele	March 14, 2011	It was Ahmed Shehzad's turn to dance down the track to a left-arm spinner and be stumped Associated Press Enlarge Related Links Analysis : 'Slave to rhythm' Gul tunes in to top form News : Batting remains Zimbabwe's biggest weakness Players/Officials: Shahid Afridi Matches: Pakistan v Zimbabwe at Pallekele Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Pakistan | Zimbabwe #p#Decision of the day Overcast conditions, worried about a top order that has performed in just one game so far, against a side with a dangerous pace attack but a potentially wonky batting order; what do you do when you win the toss as captain of one of cricket's weaker sides? You don't bat Elton. #p#Catch of the day Never has a straightforward edge behind to the wicketkeeper brought as much relief to the XI on the field and millions back home as that held by Kamran Akmal in the very first over of the game. Brendan Taylor had timed one through the covers beautifully, but off Abdul Razzaq's fifth ball of the innings he stepped out and nibbled at one. Kamran moved to his right easily to pouch it; it was probably one Taylor too late, but there you go. It set up a near-flawless performance behind the stumps. #p#Dismissals of the day One day a thesis will be written: "Ego and bluster - A history of Pakistan batting failure against left-arm spin." Who knows what goes on in their heads the second a left-arm spinner comes on? Clearly not much, given what has gone on in the past. Kamran Akmal has already done it twice in this tournament and you just knew way back when the schedules were drawn up for this shebang that the moment Ray Price came on, some young, brash kid would charge down the pitch, hit only air and be stranded halfway down the pitch, close enough to hear Price giggling away. It took ten balls on this occasion for Ahmed Shehzad to meet that very fate. And Shahid Afridi? Well, the only surprise was he wasn't charging down the pitch. #p#Surprise of the day Pakistan v Zimbabwe in Pallekele you say? Wouldn't have thought that to be in many people's plans for a rainy Monday evening 15km outside Kandy? You would think wrong. Nearly ten thousand people turned up for this rain-interrupted, and to be honest, fairly predictable game at this spanking new stadium. If that doesn't seem a lot, it certainly sounded a lot through a day with heavy showers and more than two hours playing time lost. They didn't get bored easily either, only attempting the Mexican Wave once. #p#Cheer(s) of the day The charismatic Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi was greeted by rapturous cheers every time he did, well, anything: when he was introduced as a bowler, as batsman, or when shown randomly hanging around in the dressing room on the big screen. #p#Stat of the day This was Pakistan's first successful chase in a World Cup match since the 1999 semi-final against New Zealand in Manchester. They have won six World Cup games in that time, but all while batting first.
33	506262	Pakistan v Zimbabwe, Group A, World Cup 2011, Pallekele	'Slave to rhythm' Gul tunes in to top form	Osman Samiuddin in Pallekele	March 14, 2011	Armed with the new ball, Umar Gul kept it short of a length and cut it both ways to trouble Zimbabwe Associated Press Enlarge Related Links News : Batting remains Zimbabwe's biggest weakness Report : Pakistan bowlers seal quarter-final qualification Analysis : Pakistan's left-arm spinner bogey Players/Officials: Umar Gul | Waqar Younis Matches: Pakistan v Zimbabwe at Pallekele Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Pakistan #p#Given the disasters of 2003 and 2007, simply making it to the business end of the World Cup ought to be seen as an achievement; more so with the knowledge that a Pakistan team of any era and time would have been as capable of not qualifying from this group as of getting through. A comfortable win over a weak Zimbabwe side has at least that much to recommend it. #p#That it was built on a spell from Umar Gul makes it all the more pleasing. Gul is the most unassuming bowling spearhead Pakistan have had for years, possibly ever, so much so that it is easy to not think of him as the leader of the attack at all. He doesn't even always open the bowling, a curious position for a fast-bowling spearhead to be in, as Mitchell Johnson knows. He didn't even come to the press conference after the game, as players of the match are meant to. Yet his role in how far Pakistan goes now will be vital. #p#The signs from the last two games are healthy. Gul is, as Waqar Younis has noted in the past, a slave to rhythm. If his run-up is right and his action in sync, he brings such force to his bowling that he becomes difficult to get away and keep out. Very visibly when the going is good you can see the momentum build up in his run-up, so that he fully hurls into his action. #p#The pace, as it was today and against New Zealand last week, is then consistently high, a real whiz to it, touching the early 90s (mph) and settled in the late 80s. As a batsman, getting on the front foot is rarely a smart option, and the ball seems to hit bat especially hard. #p#There has been wholeness about him over these two games. Today he cut the new ball this way and that, from just back of a length. The other day against New Zealand he chose to go fuller and swung it in and out. And whenever he has gone short he has cramped batsmen and made them uneasy. He bowled superbly in the batting Powerplay against New Zealand and was exemplary as first change. He was excellent with the new ball today. #p#Waqar said later it was an "extraordinary" spell which perhaps overdid it, but he was right in that he deserved more than just three wickets. Over the two games in Pallekele, he has deserved more than the six wickets he has taken and after an iffy evening out against Sri Lanka, Pakistan could not want him in any better shape. #p#"When we talk about Umar Gul, there are a couple of things," Waqar said. "Whenever he is hurt, he comes back a real good bowler. We have seen it in the past as well, not just here. Whenever people start talking about his rhythm or talk about dropping him, he bounces back. He's that kind of character. Against Sri Lanka, he bowled well at times and poorly at times and that hurt him. He worked tremendously hard in the nets since then and especially when he bowled out in the middle, mornings or afternoons of matches, that makes a big difference." #p#There is much more still to be done before Pakistan can call this a successful tournament, for starters a game against Australia with greater consequences than are at first apparent. But Pakistan looked more with it throughout this game than they have done for vast stretches of the last two. #p#Each catch Kamran Akmal holds on to is a little victory in itself and he was tidy enough. If Ahmed Shehzad's recklessness isn't showing signs of disappearing, then the good, common sense of Asad Shafiq's World Cup debut made up for it. Wahab Riaz had a decent day and his burden is likely to increase. And Waqar doesn't seem to be a man to get carried away either with a good win or, as we saw last week, a big, bad loss. #p#"It is pleasing that we have qualified, but the kind of team we had, it was expected we would get to the quarter-finals," he said. "To say that we have achieved a lot here because we didn't qualify the last two times would be wrong, because only once you get to the quarter-finals does the real game start, the game of nerves, the pressure game."
33	506263	Pakistan v Zimbabwe, Group A, World Cup 2011, Pallekele	Batting remains Zimbabwe's biggest weakness	Osman Samiuddin in Pallekele	March 14, 2011	Elton Chigumbura's indifferent batting form could put his captaincy under threat Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Analysis : 'Slave to rhythm' Gul tunes in to top form Report : Pakistan bowlers seal quarter-final qualification Analysis : Pakistan's left-arm spinner bogey Players/Officials: Alan Butcher | Elton Chigumbura Matches: Pakistan v Zimbabwe at Pallekele Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Zimbabwe #p#Alan Butcher gave an assessment of his side the day before the game against Pakistan. The English coach of Zimbabwe - a nice symmetry to that, with England's coach being from Zimbabwe - appears to have an intensely straight-talking side to him. He thought this World Cup had probably come four years too early for this group of players. #p#He was asked today, after a seven-wicket loss to Pakistan, his side's fourth in five group games, whether his side had given a good account of themselves in this tournament. Slowly, deliberately, he came to the stark conclusion that they hadn't. The honesty should do Zimbabwe more good than harm. The humour will be needed as well. Asked how embarrassing his side's collapse of ten for 72 against Sri Lanka was, he replied, "Embarrassing, but not as embarrassing as 9-29." #p#There is something to Butcher's assessment that this is one World Cup too soon. Clearly there is workable material within the Zimbabwe side. They may not, as he also acknowledged, become world-beaters on the level of Australia or South Africa. But they can become a side that will come to be taken with some seriousness by the opposition. #p#The batting is a problem currently. In four out of five matches, their top has toppled to such an extent that the game has been all but over in the first 15 overs. Against Pakistan they were down to 43 for 4 within 13 overs. Batting long does not come naturally yet. "We fielded well and bowled superbly, but that can't be said about our batting," Elton Chigumbura, the captain whose birthday it was, said. "We have to work on it because that has been the big problem through the tournament. Besides the batting part, we've put up a big fight. My biggest concern is on the batting in the first 15 overs, especially against stronger teams. We have to really work on that when we get home." #p#The decision to bat first itself seemed a strange one. Zimbabwe have talked up their bowling through the tournament though its lack of wicket-taking incisiveness would suggest otherwise. They went nearly 80 overs against New Zealand and Sri Lanka without taking a wicket. #p#Here, under heavy cloud with showers around, and a nervy Pakistan batting line-up susceptible to precisely such circumstances, here was a sliver of a chance. Chigumbura chose instead to make first use of the surface because, he said, it seemed a good pitch and other sides had batted first on it and flourished. #p#Stoppages for rain didn't help Zimbabwe, especially the one that ultimately curtailed their innings just when the last Powerplay had begun. "We lost momentum with the rain stopping and playing again," Chigumbura said. "The way we approached the innings was to go out in our last four overs but we didn't get that. That's cricket." #p#But ultimately, the batting just wasn't good enough. "Unfortunately [the story is] pretty much the same as the game before and the game before that," Butcher conceded. "Everybody in the dressing room, particularly the batters, are very unhappy about the way things are. None of our players are trying to give their wickets away, they are all working hard and trying to improve but things are not going their way going well for 80% of our batting unit. #p#"That happens sometimes in any team, the only thing we can do is to keep practicing, try identifying areas players need to improve and devise ways for that to happen. There's no magic formula. We have to keep going. You can tell by the way we fielded and the way spinners battled against the conditions, gripping the ball, there is no lack of spirit in the side. We just have to keep working." #p#The focus may now switch to Chigumbura's captaincy. He doesn't believe it has particularly affected his form, but he's only made 58 runs in five games in the tournament. "I haven't performed the way I wanted, but maybe it's one of those times when you just go out of form. Unfortunately it came when I was the captain but obviously I am working hard to get into form but at the end of the day it is not my decision, it' the board's."

Pakistan slipped to second place in Group A after a seven-wicket win over Zimbabwe in Pallekele on Monday, but could still finish in any of the top four positions depending on what happens against Australia, and in other games. #p#Waqar said he wasn't thinking about whom his side might play in the quarter-finals. "Right now we are thinking of only Australia," Waqar said. "If you win that game, then your morale will be such that you won't worry about any team you play." #p#Barring a shock loss to Canada, Australia will go into Saturday's game on a 34-match unbeaten streak in the World Cup, stretching back to the 1999 tournament. Their last loss, in fact, came against Pakistan, at Headingley. Ricky Ponting's team is the only unbeaten side in this tournament. #p#"You have an option [whereby] you could play the No. 4 team [from the other group] whose morale will be down," Waqar said. "But momentum is very important and necessary. Australia are such a big team, world champions, and they haven't lost for ages. That is an opportunity. If you beat them, you leave a mark. You can look at the next matches and teams will think twice about playing against you. The bigger thing is the momentum of beating the world champions and the confidence it gives you. That game is important." #p#As Sri Lanka did against Australia in a game that was eventually washed out in Colombo, Pakistan might consider playing a spin-heavy attack, though with Shahid Afridi, Abdur Rehman and Mohammad Hafeez already in the XI, they are pretty well stocked. #p#"The strategy will be very similar," Waqar said. "Try to play 50 overs first, pile up a big total, that's the key. And then, when you look at bowling sides around the world, I think we have a fairly good bowling side. If we can put a handsome total, we stand a good chance of winning that match. Or if we bowl them out cheaply, we have a good chance of chasing it." #p#There remained, Waqar insisted, further room for improvement within the side and part of his concern was directed specifically at two young batsmen, Ahmed Shehzad and Umar Akmal. Shehzad failed for the fifth match running, stumped trying to slog Ray Price. He now has 44 runs in the tournament and is a prime candidate for the axe. #p#"We're thinking of building an opening partnership, that is the first point," Waqar said. "It was a rash shot from Shehzad. It wasn't really required at the time. But don't forget he is a youngster, he is only 21 and brand new in this arena. It's not easy sometimes. In the heat of the moment you play silly shots and that's how you learn cricket. He's probably learnt a big lesson today that when the team needs you at the wicket, you should stay." #p#The more cutting observation was for Umar, who was for the second time in his short career, the subject of speculation about faking an injury to support his elder brother Kamran. Umar didn't play against Zimbabwe and when Waqar was asked about the reasons behind it, he smiled, waited and said, "He has two or three problems." He pulled back immediately, clarifying that there was a finger injury as well as an ankle injury picked up during a football session, but the comment will only fuel talk that the team management is not happy with Umar's attitude.
34	506219	World Cup 2011	Ireland seek to repeat giant-killing act	Firdose Moonda in Kolkata	March 14, 2011	#p#Reputations get built over time, with each year, each achievement, each failure and each memory adding to the album that will eventually get labelled as "so-and-so's record." The more important a person gets, the more difficult it becomes to maintain, like a vintage vehicle which always needs some work done on it to keep it going. #p#Ireland have exactly that sort of reputation. After their heroics at the 2007 World Cup, there was keen interest in whether they could repeat it at this tournament. After they stunned England, there's now keen interest in whether they can upset another big team and if they manage that, there'll be interest in how far they can go. #p#It creates a different pressure to the kind that the likes of India, South Africa and Australia face, it's a pressure of hope rather than a pressure of expectation, but it too can take its toll. William Porterfield, though evergreen as a leprechaun, may be starting to feel some of it. "South Africa were obviously one of the pre-tournament favourites and they have just beaten India in a good game of cricket as well," he said at the pre-match press conference in Kolkata. "We don't have anything to lose." #p#Besides a little bit of reputation and an outside chance making the quarterfinals, Porterfield is right. South Africa, on an upward trajectory after their win over India, are looking to seal the deal to the last eight and will probably aim to be merciless in doing so. They're unlikely to experiment, given the magnitude of the game and how wary they are of the opposition and the possibility of slipping up. Ireland can therefore do nothing but go in with that attitude. "We've played a couple of big teams now and teams that have been in form," Porterfield said. "South Africa are no different. They'll be in pretty high spirits and pretty confident. They're a top-class side. It's just another challenge for us." #p#William Porterfield's batsmen, and Kevin O'Brien in particular, will be keen for another giant-killing act AFP Enlarge #p#Keeping up appearances may be on Ireland's mind, but they're also grounded enough to know that there is a cricket match to concentrate on. Porterfield said that they've done their homework on the pitch and expect it to offer more for the seamers than some of the other surfaces they have encountered thus far. That could mean an immediate recall for Trent Johnston, who was out with a bruised knee, which he sustained while playing against India. "If Trent's fit, he plays," Porterfield said. "He's one of your first picks." #p#More than the bowling, Ireland have batting concerns with the 7 for 54 collapse against West Indies nullifying the 7 for 57 they managed with the ball. Kevin O'Brien, in particular, gets mentioned as a concern - largely because of the reputation he created for himself with the century that won the match against England. Since then, he has done little else and expectation is growing for him to produce again. "He can come off on any given day," Porterfield said. "He's had a couple of low scores but he hasn't faced many balls. He hasn't been struggling in the nets and he hasn't been struggling for form." #p#O'Brien is probably the one member of the squad who truly understands how quickly a reputation is built and how soon it needs to be fed. Although it hasn't reached starvation point yet, he'll know that one more big performance is probably required in this tournament for them to have fully serviced the car. Someone asked Porterfield if this was Ireland's last chance to make an impact and he answered using a phrase his opposite number Graeme Smith has repeated. "If we go out and do that and leave everything on the pitch, I'm happy."
34	506220	Ireland v South Africa, World Cup 2011, Group B, Kolkata	South Africa hope to avoid Irish surprise	The Preview by Abhishek Purohit	March 14, 2011	#p#Match Facts March 15, Kolkata Start time 2.30 pm (0900 GMT) #p#Dale Steyn will be a tough proposition on a surface expected to help the fast bowlers AFP Enlarge Related Links Matches: Ireland v South Africa at Kolkata Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Ireland | South Africa #p#The Big Picture #p#As the tournament heads to its business end, it is fair to say that things have gone to plan. This was supposed to be the tougher of the two groups, and has proved to be so. South Africa generally play to potential in the league stages of the World Cup, as they have done this time as well. They have mostly been in control, and the almost-mandatory "wobble", to use a substitute for that word, has been put out of the way against England. Ireland were expected to punch way above their weight as the leading Associate side, and have done exactly that. #p#Having shocked England, and given a fright to West Indies and India, they would be cursing themselves for the collapse while chasing a gettable target against Bangladesh. But when they walk out on the hallowed Eden Gardens turf tomorrow, Ireland will do so knowing this will be their toughest test of the tournament. The other big sides in the group have the tendency to leave an opening here and there for teams to try and claw back, but when South Africa close the door on their opponents, it shuts tight with cold finality. #p#South Africa will be pleased that a cog of their wheel that had come apart against England, the lower middle-order, stood up well under pressure against India. They wouldn't want it to be on trial against Ireland though, and would want to seal the quarter-final berth with a clinical win. #p#Form guide (completed matches, most recent first) Ireland LLWLW South Africa WLWWW #p#Pitch and conditions The World Cup finally shows up at Eden Gardens 16 days after it was originally supposed to. As the first of its three games in six days kicks off, India's most famous ground will be on trial after the tardiness that led to the shifting of the India-England tie to Bangalore. But a ground that has hosted a World Cup final and a semi-final deserved much better than three games involving Associates. #p#The pitch had a tinge of green on the eve of the game, and the curator has promised good bounce and carry. William Porterfield expects it to be "pretty quick" There has apparently not been much dew around in the last few days, but a surprise appearance is not discounted. Especially so, since it is the onset of summer, and while the days have started to get warm, nights can still be cool. #p#Watch out for... #p#Dale Steyn brought South Africa back against a rampant India in a controlled display of fast bowling, mixing slower ones with reverse-swinging yorkers. Graeme Smith looks to his premier fast bowler whenever he wants a crucial breakthrough, and more often than not, Steyn delivers. On a pitch that is expected to aid the seamers, getting past Steyn without much damage would be the first of Ireland's headaches. #p#Kevin O' Brien showed what he is capable of against England. He has had a couple of quiet games after that record-breaking innings. He will enjoy batting as well as bowling on this surface. Without his spark in the middle order, Ireland lack the big finish when they bat. #p#Team news Imran Tahir is still ruled out as part of his rehabilitation from a a fractured thumb, and AB de Villiers is also doubtful, having had a scan on his left thigh which revealed a muscle sprain. Colin Ingram could get a game if de Villiers misses out. Will South Africa go in with a third seamer in Lonwabo Tsotsobe? #p#South Africa (probable): 1 Graeme Smith (capt), 2 Hashim Amla, 3 Jacques Kallis, 4 AB de Villiers / Colin Ingram, 5 JP Duminy, 6 Faf du Plessis, 7 Morne van Wyk (wk), 8 Johan Botha / Lonwabo Tsotsobe, 9 Robin Peterson, 10 Dale Steyn, 11 Morne Morkel #p#Trent Johnston missed out against West Indies with a knee injury he sustained during the India game but is mostly expected to play, having trained today. Andre Botha is on the doubtful list, down with a stomach bug. #p#Ireland (possible): 1 William Porterfield (capt), 2 Paul Stirling, 3 Ed Joyce, 4 Niall O'Brien (wk), 5 Gary Wilson, 6 Kevin O'Brien, 7 Alex Cusack, 8 John Mooney, 9 Trent Johnston, 10 George Dockrell, 11 Boyd Rankin #p#Stats #p#South Africa have won both their previous ODIs against Ireland, including one during the Super Eights stage of the 2007 World Cup #p#The last World Cup match at Eden Gardens was India's ill-fated semi-final against Sri Lanka #p#Six of the 11 decided day-night games at Eden Gardens have been won by the side batting first #p#Quotes #p#"He can come off on any given day. He's had a couple of low scores but he hasn't faced many balls. He hasn't been struggling in the nets and he hasn't been struggling for form." William Porterfield isn't too bothered by Kevin O'Brien's lean returns after that century against England #p#"We're not planning on tickling anything. We are aware of what Ireland can do and we've prepared for that. We're impressed with everything they have done in this tournament so far." Corrie van Zyl , when asked if South Africa would "tickle" the line-up
34	506232	World Cup 2011	Relaxed van Zyl reflects upbeat mood	Firdose Moonda in Kolkata	March 14, 2011	#p#Just as a good marksman doesn't need a lot of shots to hit the target, South Africa don't need to over-train to be effective. After a mentally and physically draining match against India on Saturday and travelling from Nagpur to Kolkata via Mumbai on Sunday, the squad was allowed a day's rest before their match against Ireland on Tuesday. #p#"Just because we are not training, doesn't mean we are not prepared," Corrie van Zyl, South Africa coach said. "This is part of our preparation." It may seem strange that not actively doing something will have value when getting ready for an activity, like sport, that will require a lot of doing. "We don't need to train just for the sake of it," van Zyl said, indicating that the mental aspect was taking precedence this time around. #p#The win over India was a mental leap for South Africa, because they were able to come on top of a tense and pressured situation without much panic. The effect it had was evident when Robin Peterson hit the winning runs and charged around the field, possessed. Graeme Smith described it as "raw emotion" and that's exactly what it was. Joy exposed, ecstasy laid bare. #p#To come down from that high, and they've had to come down because that wasn't the final, might have felt like a crash, and that's why picking themselves up again is going to be tricky. "There is a danger of that [not being able to get up quickly enough]," van Zyl said. "But it's how you approach the danger that's important. We've got guys like Henning Gericke to help with that." Gericke is the team psychologist and will play an instrumental role in readying their minds for the next game. #p#It's not often that Corrie van Zyl cracks jokes at a press conference AFP Enlarge #p#Although they have not trained and will only see Eden Gardens on match day, van Zyl said they've made sure the venue is not foreign to them. "We've looked at all the grounds and all the stats and we know exactly what to expect from a day-night game here." South Africa have played at the ground just a year ago, a Test match against India which they lost. #p#This time the opposition is ranked much lower but South Africa are promising the same intensity they showed against Netherlands. Injury concerns will definitely keep Imran Tahir out of the match, as he still recovers from a fractured thumb. AB de Villiers strained a muscle in his left thigh during the match against India and although scans revealed that there was no tear, he is a doubtful starter. #p#That could open the door for the untested Colin Ingram to have a go, if South Africa still want to go in with seven batsman, which they may choose to do on a pitch with specks of green. The same surface could merit including an extra bowler. Having bowled out all four sides they have faced so far, South Africa are unlikely to change the bowling combination. "The bowlers have been disciplined and stuck to game plans, which is why they've been successful," van Zyl said. #p#They've also shown a remarkable calm under pressure, like when India were tearing into them on Saturday. It's that composed approach that they may have spent the day working on. van Zyl showed definite signs of having relaxed at his press conference when the microphone didn't work, simply because he hadn't pressed the button to switch it on. He blushed a little when he was shown the right switch but immediately turned the situation around into a laugh. "We don't have buttons in Bloemfontein," he said and the whole room brightened. It was the first time many had seen van Zyl crack a joke in a press conference and the easy manner with which he did may well be a reflection on the mood in the camp as a whole.
34	506242	Ireland v South Africa, Group B, World Cup 2011, Kolkata	Eden Gardens ready for World Cup	Firdose Moonda in Kolkata	March 14, 2011	Eden Gardens was denied the right to host an India-England game as the ICC felt it would not be ready in time Enlarge Related Links Sharda Ugra : Eden's exile from the action News : ICC satisfied by pace of work at Eden News : Eden Gardens loses India-England fixture Matches: Ireland v South Africa at Kolkata Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: India | South Africa Grounds: Eden Gardens #p#Eden Gardens' wait is over; the World Cup has arrived in Kolkata. It's more than two weeks later than was originally scheduled, but it's finally come. #p#It hasn't come with the pomp and ceremony it was supposed to bring: a match between India and England would have, no doubt, been played in front of a capacity crowd. It hasn't come with the local heroes that the people of Kolkata have not seen play live for their country, in the city, since February last year in a Test match. It hasn't come with a match that, on paper, offers a close contest that may prove decisive in the group stage. But it's come; and, more importantly, the iconic stadium is ready to receive it. #p#Eden Gardens was stripped of its right to host the India-England clash because the ICC decided that it would not be ready by February 27, when they inspected the venue on January 27. It was a massive blow for the stadium and considered an embarrassment; but instead of cowering away, the Cricket Association of Bengal have come out defiant, insisting that they were always ready on time. #p#Kishore Bhimani, veteran administrator, journalist and now media manager of the venue, was involved at the time and was among those who believed the match should have stayed at Eden Gardens. "I thought we were ready," he told ESPNCricinfo. "There were some problems with the drainage system, the radio boxes and the sightscreen, but I think the main issue was that there was a mismatch between our promise to them [the ICC] that we would have it all done and their belief in our promise." The drainage system and media facilities have been spruced up and the sightscreen now covers the entire lower tier, things the administrators say were easy to fix. #p#The CAB is adamant that they could have had those alterations made in time for February 27 and that they were denied their golden moment of the tournament. For them, the loss they have suffered, not just in monetary terms, but purely by not having an India game, cannot be recovered. "It's like having had diamonds and now being given silver," Biswarup Dey, the joint secretary of the CAB said. "Everything was fine, it was all ready and nothing major has changed since we were first inspected. But the ICC is the parent body and we can't say anything more." #p#Most of the officials had the same attitude, not wanting to hark back to the game they so desperately wanted to host, and are anxious to get on with hosting the matches they do have. Bhimani is even optimistic that the response from the public will be positive. "We are expecting a crowd of around 35,000 for the match between South Africa and Ireland. Of those tickets 7000-8000 were sold, the rest were given to affiliates" #p#It still means that more than half the stadium, which has a capacity of 63,000 (down from 100,000 after the renovations) will be full. That so many people were willing to buy a ticket to see the game is impressive, especially since the cheapest seat is Rs 400 (10US###), and Bhimani thinks the reason may lie with one of the teams that is in town. "South Africa are playing very well so people want to see them but they are also a real favourite in Kolkata." #p#Eden Gardens was the stadium where it all started for South Africa, in 1991, when they re-entered the international fray. This is where they came after a 22-year exile imposed on them by Apartheid and this is where they re-started as an international cricket team. #p#Bhimani was part of the organising committee for that tour and he remembers the excitement when South Africa was welcomed at Eden Gardens. "There were at least 100,000 people lining the road from the airport to the hotel to see the South African team. At the hotel, there was great curiosity from people to see the team. And they [the team] weren't worried about security, they were happy to meet people." #p#On the field, South Africa weren't quite as suave. They were overawed by having to play in a "stadium with 87,000 seats, each of which was occupied," as Bhimani said. Most of the players had only performed in front of domestic crowds in South Africa, which never numbered more than a few thousand. Andrew Hudson, who opened the batting then and is convenor of selectors now, admitted to being so nervous that "I was trembling" and was out for a third-ball duck. India won the match that day, but South Africa won hearts. #p#Twenty years later, South Africa have a lot more experience in international cricket and of playing in front of big crowds, and are back in the city for a pit-stop on what they hope will be a road to a title that has evaded them. The memories of their first visit may be what draws Indian crowds to come and watch them here but the team is not dwelling on the past. They are here thinking only of the future that they hope will include a piece of ICC silverware, and are only too happy for Kolkata to be one of the venues where that crown is won. #p#"It's a special place to play," Corrie van Zyl, South Africa coach said. "It's awesome to be back. We were here last year when the stadium was being built and it will be nice to see it now that it's finished." The concrete slabs have been replaced by bucket seats with roofs being constructed over them. Not all of the roofs are complete, with two of the stands only sheltered by a skeleton structure on which the covering is yet to be added. Ironically, that covering is being imported from South Africa.
34	506281	Albert van der Merwe	From Belville via Belfast	Firdose Moonda	March 15, 2011	van der Merwe: going Irish Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: Albert van der Merwe Matches: Ireland v South Africa at Kolkata Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Ireland #p#Albert van der Merwe was 12 when South Africa played their first one-day international. He was a young boy, overflowing with dreams, and as he saw them stride out onto the field in Kolkata, with almost 100, 000 people there to watch them, he knew it was an experience he had to have. #p#"I was watching at home with my dad and I said to him that I'd love to play at Eden Gardens someday," he told ESPNcricinfo. South Africa had been welcomed back into international competition and van der Merwe was an athletic youngster - it was something worth aspiring to. He played sport, enjoyed it and showed talent. He came from a family that did the same, with both his brothers also budding cricketers, but van der Merwe was the one who almost made it. #p#After completing high school he moved from Cape Town to attend the North West University (NWU) in Potchefstroom, a small student town an hour away from Johannesburg. There he captained the team to their first university title, leading them both with his personality, his opening batting style and his offspin. The next step would have been breaking into the first-class provincial team, the North West Dragons. There was no franchise system in place at the time, so van der Merwe knew that if he could crack the provincial team, the possibilities were endless. #p#It just didn't happen. "I was doing okay but I didn't manage to make it into the provincial set up," he said. "I carried on playing for clubs, and as I got to the end of my studies I had sorted given up on all those ideas and carried on with normal life." That meant getting a job, and since van der Merwe's interest was cricket, he decided to dabble in coaching. Cricket would always be central to his career but playing the game had long evaporated from his bucket list. #p#He emigrated to Ireland in 2004, after his friend Pieter van Niekerk, who also played on the NWU team, told him that there were opportunities for decent employment - including in cricket coaching. van der Merwe visited Belfast and something about it said home, so he made it his home. #p#"My decision to move was not based on the idea that one day I would play international cricket for a different country. I just got the job and I liked the place, so I moved." #p#Being involved with cricket as a coach meant that he couldn't keep himself off the field. He joined a club to play for, mostly at a social level. Not all of the old hunger had gone and after five seasons the big one came. In 2009, van der Merwe averaged over 40 with the bat and 20 with the ball and suddenly the old dream was stirring again. "I had had a few good club seasons and then the thought of international cricket became a reality again." A stint in the A side paved the way and, at 30, van der Merwe debuted for Ireland. #p#Twenty years since he first saw South Africa step onto the field at Eden Gardens, he will do so himself, but it won't be for the country of his birth. There won't be anything close to 100,000 people there, but a third of that will do for him. There's something bittersweet about him finally fulfilling a dream that he never allowed to die, but in a totally different way to what he imagined. His family is, understandably, ecstatic. "The support I've received from home has been amazing," he said "Some guys that I was at university with have also got hold of me to say well done, and it's just been fantastic." #p#van der Merwe has only played eight ODIs and he is yet to be picked in the starting XI at the World Cup. He can't wait to perform on the biggest stage. "It's just massive. Being at a World Cup is like being at the Olympics." Although he hasn't featured in the tournament, he said the experience as a whole, and the morale in the team, who have looked the strongest of the Associate sides, has been a highlight already. #p#"We've been up there. Obviously beating England was the biggest thing. As we were batting, the whole change room was sitting down in the front, living every ball." That victory looks destined to become what Ireland will be remembered for from this tournament but van der Merwe hopes they can add to the collection of memories. "We've also got ourselves into positions where we could have won two other games, against Bangladesh and against the West Indies. We're not here to be also-rans." The South Africans will know of him, and if they don't, they will as soon as he starts speaking. His strong Afrikaans accent will be a dead giveaway and will serve as a warning that he can understand all the chirps in their home language #p#The stark reality is that Associate cricket may soon fall into that category, though, especially when it comes to the one-day game. Ireland may be cushioned from a declining interest in the sport because of their proximity to England and the fact that many players play county cricket to make a living. van der Merwe isn't one of them, having had his career kick off with him in his thirties, and he thinks that barring those professional players, Ireland may struggle to attract others, both from other countries and from within. #p#"People don't move to Ireland for cricket reasons so it might be difficult, but we hope the work we've done in our development programme and to get sponsors won't get washed away. It will be a massive blow if we can't keep going," he said. The development programme is close to van der Merwe's heart because he runs at the Leinster Cricket Club, and it's something he is keen to nurture. Without that, he knows that players with hopes like he once had will find it difficult to make their dreams a reality. #p#van der Merwe is willing to say that both he and Ireland "have ambitions to keep going," at the highest level but since it's not in their control, they have to savour every moment at this tournament, which is what they are concentrating on now. The next big moment comes against South Africa. van der Merwe doesn't know many of the South African players personally, having only met AB de Villiers and Faf du Plessis many years ago, when they played club cricket with his brother. #p#The South Africans will know of him, and if they don't, they will as soon as he starts speaking. His strong Afrikaans accent will be a dead giveaway and will serve as a warning that he can understand all the chirps in their home language. Besides a shared background, though, van der Merwe has little in common with the South African team, and not having many close ties means that he is unlikely to feel any oddness about playing former countrymen. #p#"It might be a bit strange when the anthems start playing," he said. van der Merwe left South Africa when he was 25 and knows every word of "Nkosi Sikelele Afrika" Maybe something inside him will be singing along, but he said he won't be tempted to belt out his home country's ode to peace. "I'll be singing the Irish anthem. I'm just as proud to be pulling on the Irish jumper as anyone else."

Ireland's effort began like a dream and ended like a nightmare as they showcased the inconsistency that holds back upwardly-mobile Associate teams. There was disciplined, if somewhat limited, bowling; there were breath-taking fielding efforts to go with grassed sitters; and there was the glaring inability to land the knockout punch, as they let things drift after hustling their opponents into a corner. Duminy was ready when they ran out of steam, and made them pay with a well-paced innings. #p#If Dale Steyn doesn't get you, Morne Morkel will, and Ireland found this out the hard way, chasing a tall score on a wicket with true bounce. Morkel removed the openers with his menacing lengths and the back-up bowlers, led by Robin Peterson, ensured there was no escape route for the middle order. Under lights, the game petered out into a mismatch, Ireland's first in a spirited World Cup campaign, and confirmed South Africa's entry into the quarters, while the jostling continues for the remaining spots from Group B. #p#The one-sided finish seemed unlikely when Ireland's trademark enthusiasm had reduced South Africa to 117 for 5 by the 27th over. Ireland's initial brilliance was epitomised by two outstanding efforts on the field - first, George Dockrell moved rapidly to his left from a widish third man, tumbled, yet held on to a fierce upper cut from Hashim Amla. Then, John Mooney caught a struggling Graeme Smith short with a fierce pick up and throw from midwicket. Smith's exit in the tenth over exposed South Africa's middle order and they continued to wobble as Jacques Kallis was run out for the second successive innings, and Faf du Plessis guided tamely into the slips. Ironically, AB de Villiers' replacement helped South Africa stem the rot that might have never set in if he had been playing. de Villiers' absence allowed Morne van Wyk to bat at No. 3 and Colin Ingram at No. 7, and both batsmen played crucial hands to propel South Africa. #p#Smart Stats The win is South Africa's seventh by a margin of hundred or more runs in World Cups. The 131-run margin of defeat is Ireland's biggest in World Cups, surpassing their 129-run loss to New Zealand in 2007. Eden Gardens hosted its 23rd ODI, the most for any ground in India. It has hosted 14 day-night games, which is the third highest among all Indian grounds. JP Duminy's became the second batsman after Adam Gilchrist to be dismissed for 99 in a World Cup match. Overall, there have been 36 occasions when a player has been dismissed in the nineties in World Cups. The 87-run stand between Duminy and Colin Ingram is the highest for the sixth wicket for South Africa in World Cups. The highest sixth-wicket stand for South Africa in ODIs is the 137 between Hansie Cronje and Shaun Pollock against Zimbabwe in 1997. The 76 runs conceded by Trent Johnston in his ten overs is the highest by an Irish bowler in a World Cup (completed spell of ten overs). The highest number of runs conceded by an Irish bowler in ODIs is 95 in nine overs by Peter Connell against New Zealand in 2008. Robin Peterson's 3 for 32 is his third three-wicket haul and his second-best bowling performance in ODIs after his 3 for 22 against England in Chennai. #p#By his own admission, van Wyk's batting is not "poetry in motion", and his cameo at No. 3 justified that evaluation. His loose on-the-up drives without much foot movement left him prone to edges and soft dismissals, and he was lucky to escape twice, with Kevin O'Brien and Paul Stirling spilling straightforward chances. The reprieves had no impact on van Wyk, who kept backing himself to clear the infield, until George Dockrell slipped a perceptive arm-ball past him in the 16th over. van Wyk had by then provided the early momentum, that allowed Duminy and Ingram the time to settle in before turning things around. #p#Duminy initially chose caution against Dockrell's attacking line outside off, one that spinners have used to torment in him the past. He kept deflecting and nudging, lapping and steering for ones and twos, and his inventiveness inevitably led to the Irish dropping their guard. Ingram cashed in when they delivered loose deliveries, targeting the square fields with a series of powerful horizontal-bat shots. Johnston castled him in the 40th over, but by then South Africa had wrested control. #p#In the meantime, Duminy had seamlessly shifted gears from nurdle to attack mode, and was on the verge of hitting overdrive. After 46 boundary-less balls, his first four came through the most audacious of reverse-sweeps. By the time he brought up his half-century, caressing Johnston into the covers, his strike-rate was nudging the 80s. Ingram's dismissal forced him to reassess the situation, and he chose to delay the Powerplay to the absolute end. #p#He had chugged along to 68 when the Powerplay came on by default in the 46th over. A couple of quiet overs from Mooney and Boyd Rankin suggested a whimpering finish. Duminy, however, lined up Trent Johnston for special treatment in the 49th over, dumping him for four and six over the leg side, before forcing another boundary to third man. With three balls to go, and 99 against his name, Duminy did not push the single. He instead looked for the straight six and perished in the outfield. In a sense, it was a fitting end to an innings that was all about shot selection and selflessness. #p#Match Timeline

It wasn't a particularly short ball, it wasn't a particularly inviting one, but Amla decided that it was the one he would hit. He got under the ball and flat batted it over midwicket, with only the timing taking it over the rope. The mood didn't last, because he tried to upper-cut the next ball and the shot had none of the timing of the first, making its way into the hands of George Dockrell. #p#The hero turned antihero, turned hero again Kevin O'Brien has a long way to go to recapture the magic he held in his hands against England in Bangalore. Since then, he has had two single-digit scores against India and West Indies. Looking for redemption against South Africa, Morne van Wyk fed him a ball at short cover off the bowling of Trent Johnston. He must have fed it in particularly spicy fashion because even though O'Brien didn't have to move to get hold of it, he dropped it the instant it found him. O'Brien had both hands under the ball and should have held on to it. Just when it looked like his World Cup was fading fast, he managed to grab a well-judged catch, running backwards, to dismiss JP Duminy on 99. #p#Desperate moment of the day Graeme Smith and Morne van Wyk can make an equally desperate pair. One is looking for form and the other to cement his place in the national side. When two such desperations collide, the result can only be disaster. van Wyk was hitting everything he could and more, and his anxiety to turn the strike over saw him call for a run after nudging the ball no further than John Mooney at midwicket. Smith was keen to get to the other side too, heeded the call and when he realised it was time to turn back, Mooney had beat him to it. #p#Sluggish moment of the day Jacques Kallis had no-one but himself to blame for the way he was run out, the second time in four matches. He laboured through the run, called by JP Duminy, and was slow to get going and slow to reach the other end. Worst of all, he didn't even put in a dive at the end. Niall O'Brien, the Ireland wicketkeeper, who had to collect a throw and break the stumps, did a far speedier job, and Kallis paid the price for braking when he should have accelerated. #p#Most-active player who wasn't playing AB de Villiers was forced to sit out the match because of a muscle-sprain in his left thigh, and he has also been battling with a stiff back, but he can't be kept out of the action. When it was time to serve drinks, de Villiers was the one carrying them onto the field, making sure his team-mates had had enough and even offering a few words of advice. The cameras constantly found de Villiers in the thick of things, talking to the playing XI and being as much a part of the team as he could. #p#The look of death Dale Steyn and Morne Morkel are supposed to hunt down wickets in a pair, and although they haven't always shared the new ball in this tournament, they're still regarded as a twosome. Morkel had the opportunity to help his partner twice, and both times he fluffed it. The first chance came when Porterfield pulled Steyn to fine leg, where Morkel was fielding. He overran it and the ball went for four. Steyn stared and Morkel trembled. The third ball of the next over, Morkel was offered a straightforward catch at third man off Paul Stirling's bat. Morkel went down on his knees and made a mess of it. Steyn couldn't even look at him that time, directing his angry gaze at the floor instead. It didn't help that Morkel took both Porterfield and Stirling's wickets at the other end. #p#Body blow of the day Kevin O'Brien had a rude reception to the crease courtesy of Jacques Kallis. He had faced just two balls when he was given a bouncer, which he wore on the back and made him roll on to the ground. He didn't escape there and Morne van Wyk caught the ball and hit the stumps. The review, which found O'Brien to be safe, gave him time to rub the sore spot a little and recover in time to hit the last ball of the over for four. #p#The catch that won the match van Wyk faced some criticism after dropping two catches against India but made up for it with four catches in this innings. The last one, which ended the Irish innings, was the finest of them all. The ball came off the shoulder of George Dockrell's bat and van Wyk had to dive to his right, full stretch. He took the catch one-handed, in picture-perfect fashion to seal the South African win.

34	506412	Ireland v South Africa, Group B, World Cup 2011, Kolkata	Smith searching for perfect game	Firdose Moonda at Eden Gardens	March 15, 2011	#p#Relief is not an expression South Africa cricketers have worn often in World Cups, which may explain why Graeme Smith was donning it with such pride at his post-match press conference in Kolkata. South Africa's 131-run win over Ireland makes them the first team in Group B that is certain of a quarter-final spot. They also have a game in hand before the knockouts start. #p#"It's fantastic to have qualified already," Smith said. "Our group is pretty tense this week and it's nice that we don't have to deal with that tension for a change." Bangladesh, England, West Indies and India will fight it out for the remaining three spots, with India all but assured of a place. #p#It leaves South Africa with the clearest path to topping the group, which will mean they will take on whoever finishes fourth in Group A, currently Australia, but that could easily change. Smith is not allowing himself to get flustered by the permutations, saying that doing so is futile. "It doesn't matter who you play in the quarters, you have to win that game. It's pointless trying to nitpick and plan." #p#Instead, what he wants to work on is South Africa mastering the art of playing the perfect game, something he feels they haven't managed in the five matches they've played so far. "In every game there's probably something you can say we haven't done well. The first 10-14 overs against India with the ball and we didn't finish with the bat against England." #p#In the match against Ireland, it was again the batting that Smith was not happy with. "We got ourselves into a bit of trouble today, with some stupid run outs." His own form is also a concern with the 45 he scored in the first match against West Indies in Delhi still his top score. Smith has looked scratchy in his other knocks but it hasn't mattered for the team as a whole because someone in the line-up has always contributed. Smith insists that a big innings is imminent. "I have been hitting the ball well in the nets. When I do come right, I will make it count and I look forward to contributing." #p#Graeme Smith: "We got ourselves into a bit of trouble today, with some stupid run outs." Getty Images Enlarge #p#Even though he hasn't been able to play a major role with the bat, it's his leadership that the team are blossoming under. "In every game we've fixed what we did wrong in the previous game. Now, we need to play a full 100 overs." #p#Their remaining group match against Bangladesh presents them with an opportunity to do that. South Africa have been clear that they are not using any matches to experiment, and that any juggling of the starting XI is based solely on conditions and suitability. "We'll go to Bangladesh with a mindset to win but we'll also have to look at our injuries." #p#Legspinner Imran Tahir should be available for selection after completing his 10-day rest period for a fractured thumb and AB de Villiers should have recovered from a thigh muscle strain. Dale Steyn, who felt discomfort in his side in the match against Ireland, should also be fit, but Smith said they "will consider using Lonwabo Tsotsobe or Wayne Parnell." #p#The options available to South Africa leaves the selection committee spoilt for choice but also with a tough task, since juggling players who are all performing is as difficult as juggling those who are searching for form. It's exactly the situation South Africa wanted to create for themselves as they approach the crescendo of their tournament - which is still some time away. "If you have a team where everybody can contribute on the day, you are not reliant on one or two people," Smith said. #p#It's not just the performance that Smith is satisfied with, it's the responses that the team have had in the various situations and surfaces they've played on that he is happy with too. "Everywhere we have played in India the surfaces have been so different and we've adapted well. We've hung in there when we needed to, we've been able to pounce when we needed to and that's been very exciting to me."
34	506415	Ireland v South Africa, Group B, World Cup 2011, Kolkata	South Africa learning to deal with pressure	Firdose Moonda at Eden Gardens	March 15, 2011	Colin Ingram had only batted at No. 7 once before for South Africa, but fit into the role against Ireland Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Report : Clinical South Africa surge into quarter-finals Players/Officials: Jean-Paul Duminy | Colin Ingram | Graeme Smith Matches: Ireland v South Africa at Kolkata Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Ireland | South Africa #p#A win over Ireland, however clinical it may be, is probably not one of the items you will see on a list of things to do to learn how to deal with pressure. As respectable and feisty as they are, if it's not their day, it's not their day, and playing against them can become like an extended practice session. #p#It could turn passionate men into robots, methodically going through the motions until the inevitable conclusion is reached. It could mean that some of their senses are dulled, their reactions are less sharp and their effort is being saved for later on. It could result in them being caught off guard, letting it slip somewhere and turning what should be training into a tense contest, unnecessarily. #p#For the first 27 overs of the match, that was South Africa. Hashim Amla was dismissed after a well-judged catch by George Dockrell, attempting to upper-cut and not hitting the ball hard enough. Morne van Wyk was dropped twice and that must have ruffled him, because he called for a single that ran out Graeme Smith. In an attempt at redemption, van Wyk blazed for a while and then was then defeated by a good ball that kept low. Jacques Kallis was caught dawdling and Faf du Plessis re-enacted the perfect way to be caught at slip. #p#South Africa were in a precarious position at 117 for 5 that could easily have become 170 all out. Only a delicate toasting of a middle order that was as soft as a marshmallow in the match against England and an entire ODI series against India could prevent it. It was a situation that a team unprepared for a brush with tension would have let get out of control. South Africa are desperate to show that they are no longer that team. #p#"Even though we were under pressure, we still managed to keep the run-rate up and I thought Colin [Ingram] did fantastically well coming in," Smith, the South Africa captain, said. Ingram and JP Duminy, who is considered the marshal of the middle order, put on 87 for the sixth wicket at more than a run a ball, and knocked the wind out of the Ireland bowlers' sails. #p#What was particularly impressive was the way Ingram handled the pressure despite the fact it was his first outing in this tournament. Drafted into the side because of an injury to AB de Villiers, Ingram had to slot into a position, the No. 7 slot, that he had been in only once for the national side before the game. Ingram has most often been used at No. 3, in the absence of Jacques Kallis, and there had been looming question marks over his ability to change roles. #p#Ingram had a lot to prove, and having not had an opportunity in the tournament yet, his hunger was evident, and, to an extent, all-consuming. It overtook the pressure of the situation because Ingram made it more about his own contest with the bowlers. It was a battle all the way, but one that Ingram can walk away from knowing he gave his all. "He was feeling a bit down with a stomach bug, so it was good to see him fight as well as he did," Duminy said. #p#Duminy too had a score to settle with critics wanting more from him as a senior player in the middle order. His two one-day centuries have come against Zimbabwe, and even though his 99 on Tuesday was also against a smaller team, the circumstances meant that, had he got the extra run, the ton would have been higher ranked than the previous two. #p#Perhaps the calls for Duminy to play an innings of authority stemmed from the fact that he has not been tested enough in tough situations, but he showed that when the occasion arises for him to do so, he is capable. #p#He fell short of a century playing a glory shot, but said that the hundred wasn't on his mind as much as the wellbeing of the team was. "I was thinking of getting as many as we could. You never quite know what's a good enough score and one or two runs can make a difference." Nonetheless he rates the innings as "one of the better ones" of his career thus far. #p#While Ingram and Duminy were involved in their personal combats, the pressure dissipated and the two had played South Africa into a comfortable position. It was the second time that the middle order had come through for the team, the first being against India last Saturday, and it's all part of how the squad is learning to cope with pressure. The match against India also saw them put out a massive fire, that time with the ball. With India looking set for a score in excess of 350, it was up to the likes of Johan Botha, Robin Peterson and Dale Steyn to come through under pressure. #p#South African cricket and pressure will always be linked until they win a major trophy, but the strides they are taking towards ensuring they are ready to do that cannot go unnoticed. In each of their last two matches, they've been faced with a potential pressure cooker and both times, they've let out the stopper and been in control of the situation. It's all part of a plan that South Africa hope to be able to execute in the knockout stages, which is why it's not important who they manage to achieve it against now; what's vital is that they do manage, and so far, they have.
34	506416	Ireland v South Africa, Group B, World Cup 2011, Kolkata	Porterfield proud of bowlers, ground-fielding	Firdose Moonda at Eden Gardens	March 15, 2011	#p#An Irish journalist, one who has followed the team through their various divisions, arrived at Eden Gardens with hope in his heart, but reality in his head. "It's not like the last time," he said. "Then you only had to win one of our three games to get to the next round; now even if you win three games you are not assured of a place in the knockouts." #p#The "then" he was referring to was the 2007 World Cup, when Ireland's stunning win over Pakistan, and later Bangladesh, shook the cricketing world. So surprising was their performance that it may have played some part in the 2011 tournament structure. The two groups of seven, with the next round being the quarterfinals, is a format designed to send the Full Members through to the knockouts and the Associates home. #p#By its very foundation, this edition of the World Cup was built to disadvantage the smaller teams. If they wanted to challenge the system, it would require a consistent effort over a month of competition, in which they would face four Test playing nations. It means that they wouldn't be rewarded for one case of luck; they'd need to show that good fortune is matched with good skills and that they are able sustain their intensity over a period of time. #p#Ireland were the one Associate that stood a chance of doing that. After pushing Bangladesh to within 27 runs of a loss, they beat England, gave a respectable account of themselves against India and lost a by a margin of less than 50 runs against West Indies. Their last chance to qualify for the quarterfinals was to beat South Africa, a task as daunting as they get, and after a crushing 131-run defeat, the sparks they lit at the tournament have been put out. They still have a match to play, but it will have no impact on whether they qualify for the knockouts. The dream is over, but there is time for reflection on the highlights. #p#Porterfield was a proud man despite the weaknesses his side displayed. Getty Images Enlarge #p#"We knew today was a final for us in terms of keeping hopes alive for qualifying," William Porterfield, the Ireland captain said. "We've done a lot of good things in this tournament. The result against England stands out, but the way we bowled and fielded throughout the tournament, especially our ground fielding has been right up there with anyone." #p#Ireland's commitment was on display again on Tuesday, when they threw their bodies around Eden Gardens from ball one, when Gary Wilson prevented a run from being scored. The effort they put into cutting off the run flow was undone by the two catches they dropped and it's that kind of consistency that Ireland lack. #p#They've been able to play well for periods of matches, but only once, against England, did the whole package come together. Issues of finishing, both with bat and ball, are some of the concerns they need to address, and Porterfield spoke about wasted opportunities. #p#"We got ourselves into a lot of winning positions. In the game against the West Indies we were right in the game. We should have won the game against Bangladesh in the end too." Against South Africa, they had big name opposition with their backs against the wall at 117 for 5 but then let them accumulate 272. #p#Porterfield was not unhappy with the bowling, even though they did not bowl South Africa out, saying that he was satisfied with the effort they made to take more wickets. "Boyd [Rankin] came back; he is our principle wicket-taker. We wouldn't have done things very differently. We weren't too distraught at half-time." #p#Their chase, dented by wickets, is what Porterfield thinks should have gone better. "Throughout the tournament, we formed a few good partnerships but we never backed up one partnership with a second." Their highest partnership against South Africa was 41 runs, between Kevin O'Brien and Gary Wilson, but they have had two century partnerships, against England and India, in the tournament. #p#Porterfield was a proud man despite the weaknesses his side displayed. He felt his team had played with a lot of heart and that they will benefit from the experience as a whole. "The more we play against [big] teams, the more we are learning as a unit. We are going to take a lot out of this tournament." #p#Their last match, on Friday against the Netherlands, will be their last hurrah, for this World Cup and possibly for a long time, as the fifty-over tournament will become smaller from the next edition. That match, which is all about playing for pride, will have a much deeper context to it, because the two teams that meet may disappear from the ODI stage for an indefinite period. "It's not going to be difficult to get the guys up for it," Porterfield said. "It's probably the first match we are going into as favourites."
35	506309	Australia v Canada, Group A, World Cup 2011, Bangalore	John Davison to retire after Australia game	Brydon Coverdale in Bangalore	March 15, 2011	#p#John Davison, the Canada allrounder who in 2003 broke the record for the fastest World Cup century, has announced his retirement. Davison, 40, was born in Canada but has lived nearly all his life in Australia, and he will finish his career with Wednesday's match against the Australians, the first time he has had the chance to play against his home country. #p#"It's pretty fitting that it is against Australia," Davison said on the eve of the match in Bangalore. "I've lived all my life there. I was never quite good enough to get a game for them. It will be a great experience to play against them. There's some guys in the team who I've had a fair bit to do with, playing against or coaching. So it would be nice to have a good showing against them." #p#Davison spent the first half of his career as an offspinner for Victoria and South Australia, but never quite lived up to his potential and finished his career with 83 wickets for the states at an average of 55.56. However, when he discovered that he was eligible to play for Canada, having been born in British Columbia, it put a new spin on his career. #p#He was thrust into the national side for the 2003 World Cup and found a new lease of life as an aggressive opening batsman. His finest moment was unquestionably his 67-ball century against West Indies at Centurion during that tournament, which was at the time the quickest World Cup hundred but has since been surpassed by both Matthew Hayden and Kevin O'Brien. #p#"I was hitting them a lot better (in 2003) than I am now," Davison said. "It was a fantastic wicket, the ball wasn't swinging and I was just able to hit through the line of the ball. It was just one of those days where everything I tried came off. Hopefully there's one more innings like that left in me." #p#John Davison will end his Canada career against a country he's lived in for nearly all his life AFP Enlarge #p#Davison has played 31 one-day internationals for Canada, including 19 as captain, and he has scored 785 runs at 27.06 and collected 35 wickets at 29.65. Ashish Bagai, the current national captain, said Davison had been a fantastic ambassador for cricket in Canada. #p#"He's given Canada a name in the world of cricket," Bagai said. "I've learned a fair bit from him and the players appreciate having him in the dressing room, both on and off the field. He's brought professionalism and a good work ethic and self-belief in this side. That's irreplaceable." #p#In his final match, Davison will come up against several men he has either played with over the years or mentored in his role as a coach at Australia's Centre of Excellence in Brisbane. Nobody goes back further with Davison than the Australia captain Ricky Ponting, who first came across Davison when they were both part of the 1991 intake at Australia's cricket academy. #p#"We had a few overseas tours together as part of that academy and we played with and against each other for quite a period of time through different state competitions back home," Ponting said. "He's got a lot to do with the development of young Australian players now, being one of the coaches at the Centre of Excellence in Australia. #p#"He's obviously got some great memories now out of World Cup cricket, playing with Canada, that he probably never thought he would have. At one stage to have the fastest World Cup hundred ever is a great achievement for him. He'll be able to look back at the end of his career and look at some pretty good memories."
35	506344	Australia v Canada, Group A, World Cup 2011, Bangalore	Krejza ready to meet his mentor	Brydon Coverdale in Bangalore	March 15, 2011	Jason Krejza will face his spin-bowling mentor John Davison during Australia's match against Canada AFP Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: John Davison | Jason Krejza Matches: Australia v Canada at Bangalore Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Canada #p#Throwdowns from the coach are a common part of practice, but what about bowling to the coach? And not in the nets - in the heat of battle in a World Cup match. That's the prospect facing Jason Krejza on Wednesday, when he tries to outsmart John Davison, part-time Canada cricketer and full-time coach at Australia's Centre of Excellence. #p#"I'm looking forward to that," Krejza says. "He's coaching you and all of a sudden he's playing against you in a World Cup. He's one of the better spin coaches I've had just because he thinks of things a little differently. He'll probably bring out something that doesn't make me think very well, but that's all right. It'll be a good challenge." #p#Krejza doesn't have a full-time spin mentor, but has done plenty of work at the Centre of Excellence. He says one session with a man like Davison is worth half a dozen with a team-mate or non-specialist coach, so the chance to bowl to him in a match should be invaluable - even if he is trying to belt Krejza out of the park. #p#"I'm in a really fortunate position where I can be a coach and play against some guys that I've trained and then give them feedback," Davison says of facing Krejza. "I'm really looking forward to that experience, and Steve Smith is the same, I've had a fair bit to do with him. If I can manage to stay out in the middle for a while and face some balls from them, I can't imagine a better place for a coach to give feedback from." #p#For Krejza, that advice will be important as he continues to rebuild his career. Few men have had as up-and-down an introduction to the international scene as Krejza, who took 12 wickets on Test debut in Nagpur, and was then axed after only one more match, when the South Africans feasted on his offbreaks at the WACA and he took match figures of 1 for 204. #p#That was the start of two years spent in and out of the Tasmania team, where he was competing for a place with Xavier Doherty. Commentators and fans alike couldn't work out how Krejza, who was generally regarded as the biggest turner of the ball in Australia, certainly among finger-spinners, could fail to be in the national team. #p#There was even an internet campaign to get him back in the side, led by the Concerned Tasmanians for Jason Krejza page on Facebook. And when Nathan Hauritz was dropped on the eve of the Ashes, and Doherty and Michael Beer were used during the series, it seemed that Krejza's chance for another go at international cricket had passed. #p#But sometimes, being the last man standing is enough for Australian spinners to be given an opportunity, and when Hauritz, Doherty and Steve O'Keefe were all unavailable for the World Cup due to injuries, the selectors called on Krejza, who hadn't been named in the preliminary 30-man squad. It was the second chance that slow men like Bryce McGain, Beau Casson and Dan Cullen have never received. #p#"I was dropped for that reason of leaking too many runs," Krejza says. "That's what I went back and worked on. I thought I did that. I've worked on that and created a different side to my bowling, which I always had but I always felt that need to attack. I still do now, but if I'm called upon to try and bowl a few tight overs then I've worked on that for the last couple of years." #p#The wickets haven't exactly been flowing for Krejza in this World Cup, although Ricky Ponting says he has improved with every game. Having not taken a wicket since the tournament opener against Zimbabwe, he'll be desperate for a big collection in the next couple of games against Canada and Pakistan, and hopes for some assistance from the surfaces in Bangalore and Colombo. #p#"The wickets can differ quite a lot here, as we've seen already," Krejza says. "Some can turn a lot, like the game against Sri Lanka, and some haven't turned a hell of a lot. Some are a bit slower, which is good because the spinners can take the pace off the ball. If they're going hard you can try to reel it back in by taking the pace off it and setting good fields. It does suit spin bowling, obviously. They do throw up a mixed bag of wickets." #p#Krejza knows that if he can find his touch at this World Cup, a Test recall is not out of the equation. Australia's next Test tour is not until August, in Sri Lanka, and while Beer is the incumbent after debuting in the Sydney Ashes Test, Krejza could yet find himself back in the mix. #p#"I don't look too far ahead these days, but that's something people have spoken to me about," he says. "That's a long way off. I've got this World Cup to think about, and if I do bowl well and things happen at the end, that's great for me. I've just got to keep working hard here and then those things will follow." #p#A strong performance against Canada would be a good start. And when he heads home for the winter, a few sessions with Davison might help as well.
35	506345	Australia v Canada, Group A, World Cup 2011, Bangalore	Australia not looking to experiment against Canada	The Preview by Sriram Veera in Bangalore	March 15, 2011	#p#Match Facts #p#March 16, Bangalore Start time 14:30 (09.00 GMT) #p#John Davison could open in his last match for Canada AFP Enlarge Related Links News : Hastings in frame as Aussies look to rest Tait News : John Davison to retire after Australia game Matches: Australia v Canada at Bangalore Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Australia | Canada #p#The Big Picture #p#As Ricky Ponting was leaving the press conference, a scribe offered a friendly bit of advice: "Please bowl first, mate." Ponting turned, smiled and said, "Ha! Bowl first eh?" before gliding out of view. Despite Ireland's commendable performance, and two honourable fights by Canada and Kenya, Australia taking on an Associate still makes people wonder how long the game will last. A tired journalist's view is, "Canada bat first, get bowled out for a paltry score, let the chase be done with and let's hit the pub" It's a view that might be shared by Australian fans too, though they might want to see the spinners do a better job, and Ricky Ponting hit form with a big innings. The underdog fan might want a minor miracle. What about the players? #p#Ashish Bagai, Canada's captain, was asked a direct question about it: Will Canada try to play 50 overs and be satisfied with the honor earned in doing that? If he found it condescending, or realistic, Bagai didn't show it. He just laughed a laugh that was open to interpretation before saying, "This is our last game. We will like to end it with a win. We will try doing that" #p#For his part, Ponting said, "The time for experiments is over. We have three games in a week's time before the quarters and we want to be playing at our best. We are looking to win tomorrow's game comfortably." #p#For Canada this is as big as it gets. It is their final appearance on this stage before they disappear for four more years, and maybe more, depending on the ICC's designs for 2015. It is also John Davison's last game and Canada are thinking about the possibility of sending him to open. It will also be the last sighting of Bagai, a fabulous wicketkeeper, and Balaji Rao, a legspinner who has dared to flight, drift, and turn, something uncommon in the bigger teams. #p#Australia's 33-match unbeaten run in World Cups is unlikely to end tomorrow but they have to iron out a few wrinkles. Ponting's form hasn't been too flash and he knows it. "I would have liked to score more runs in the game against Zimbabwe but was run out. The other games too were the same. Getting 30 or 40 is not what you are after; you have to make big scores. Since we have not played too many games, we are out of touch." The spinners haven't set the world on fire as Ponting said the other day. Their batsmen will also be tested by Rao. #p#Form guide (most recent first) #p#Australia : WWWWW #p#Canada : LWLLL #p#Watch out for... #p#Bagai's wicketkeeping : MS Dhoni is the best at stumpings and Kumar Sangakkara is solid all round but Bagai has looked the most fluent and natural keeper in the competition. He is quick on his feet, uses soft hands, has a wonderful anticipation, and oozes confidence when he stands up to the medium-pacers. Of course Canada rarely get close to winning, and so we will never know how good Bagai is in pressure situations, but there is enough skill to make you watch him keep. #p#After Shahid Afridi, Balaji Rao has to be the one of the best legspinners out there. While Afridi snares his victims with sliders and variations in pace, Rao tries to treat your senses. The slow amble to the crease, the ripping release, the courage to flight, the ability to get it to drift, and the turn he can extract, makes him a neat package to watch. #p#When Brad Haddin is at his best, he reminds you of Damien Martyn, especially when he unfurls that silky drive through extra cover. The problem is he suddenly changes into Shane Watson. For a man who can time the ball so well, he often goes hard at the ball and tries to crash it up and over the field. Perhaps he still sees himself as a wicket keeper-batsman, whose job is to score quick runs, rather than a top-class batsman. Ponting urged him to convert his starts and that's a sign that the captain wants Haddin to have higher ambitions. #p#Pitch and conditions #p#The pitch is the same one on which Australia played Kenya. So it is bound to get slower and aid turn. It will be interesting to see how the Australian batsmen fare against the spinners. #p#Team news #p#Considering the workload in playing three games in quick succession, Australia are likely to rest Shaun Tait and give John Hastings a go. #p#Australia (probable): 1 Shane Watson, 2 Brad Haddin (wk), 3 Ricky Ponting (capt), 4 Michael Clarke, 5 Cameron White, 6 Michael Hussey, 7 Steven Smith, 8 John Hastings, 9 Mitchell Johnson, 9 Brett Lee, 10 Jason Krejza #p#Canada (probable): 1 Hiral Patel, 2 John Davison, 3 Zubin Surkari, 4 Ashish Bagai (wk), 5 Jimmy Hansra, 6 Rizwan Cheema, 7 Ruvindu Gunasekara/Parth Desai, 8 Harvir Baidwan, 9 Khurram Chohan, 10 Henry Osinde, 11 Balaji Rao #p#Stats and trivia #p#Ricky Ponting is only player to have scored 1000 World-cup runs as a captain.

35	506374	Australia v Canada, Group A, World Cup 2011, Bangalore	Hastings in frame as Aussies look to rest Tait	Brydon Coverdale in Bangalore	March 15, 2011	#p#John Hastings could be set for a World Cup debut as Australia consider resting Shaun Tait for their match against Canada on Wednesday. However, no other changes are expected, with several batsmen still in need of time in the middle, although there could be a slight reworking of the batting order to give Steven Smith and Cameron White the chance to play a reasonable innings. #p#Australia have already qualified for the quarter-finals and the Canada game is one of three in the space of seven days, before they hit the knockout stage of the tournament. That might not be a heavy schedule by the standards of first-class cricket, but Tait no longer plays the long format and the Australians are loath to push his body too hard. #p#"Tait would be the obvious one, three games in a short period of time, he's probably the obvious one to give a break," Ponting said. "If he was to go, then Hastings would come in and then we look at what we do with the new ball, that would create some issues, but that would be the obvious change we'd look at." #p#Mitchell Johnson would be the logical candidate to share the new ball with Brett Lee if Tait doesn't play, but the Australians prefer to use Johnson as first-change. Whatever they do, they will be keen for a more convincing bowling performance than they served up against Kenya, who lost only three wickets to the attack on Sunday, along with three run-outs. #p#They also want more runs from White, who hasn't made an ODI half-century since before the Australian summer began, and was bowled for 2 against Kenya, the only batsman to fail. White could move up the order against Canada, in an effort to play him into form, while Smith has faced only 19 balls in the tournament. #p#John Hastings could be given his opportunity against Canada Getty Images Enlarge #p#"The batting stuff could be relying on how the game is actually going," Ponting said of possible changes to the order. "Haddin, Watson and Clarke at the moment all look pretty good. Myself and Whitey could probably do with more time in the middle as could Steve Smith. Mike Hussey, even though he played well, needs more game time. We'll make sure we have our thinking right for tomorrow." #p#Australia won't know until the weekend where they will play their quarter-final, with India's match against West Indies on Sunday likely to determine the schedule. But whatever is to come for the Australians after they face Canada and Pakistan, Ponting believes teams will be worried about playing the defending champions when the sudden-death stage begins. #p#"We've started the tournament really well, all the talk was about India and Sri Lanka and South Africa coming here," Ponting said. "We've been able to sneak under the radar a bit, even the last three or four weeks, so nothing has changed from us. We know we're a competitive team and a good team and if we play our best we'll be hard to beat in any conditions. #p#"We have to play a bit freer that we did the other night. That was a result of guys wanting to make the most of their opportunity in the middle the other day, once we get some continuity with our cricket you'll see us play better and everyone else can start worrying about playing against us. This is not being silly, but towards the end of the tournament, teams will be fearing playing against us just because of our record in the tournament."
35	506456	Australia v Canada, Group A, World Cup 2011, Bangalore	Rusty Australia swamp fighting Canada	The Report by George Binoy	March 16, 2011	#p#Australia 212 for 3 (Watson 94, Haddin 88) beat Canada 211 (Patel 54, Lee 4-46) by seven wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details #p#Shane Watson hit the longest six of the World Cup, a 104 metre monster over long-on Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Analysis : Australia need to lift against better teams News : Bagai calls for regular competitive cricket Features : Hiral Patel's timeless moment Matches: Australia v Canada at Bangalore Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Australia | Canada #p#By the time Shane Watson and Brad Haddin were launching the ball with frightening regularity into sparsely populated stands at the Chinnaswamy Stadium, Australia had taken control of a game that extended their unbeaten run in World Cups to 34 matches, and vaulted them from fourth to first in Group A. Though the margin of victory - seven wickets with 91 balls to spare - was huge, they did not have it easy throughout. Canada ambushed them with the bat, and then created some chances with the new ball. Australia's pace and power eventually swamped them but Ashish Bagai's team exceeded expectations in their final World Cup appearance. #p#When Bagai chose to bat, the probability of an early finish in Bangalore increased significantly, but Australia's inevitable supremacy was delayed by an extraordinary attack from 19-year-old Hiral Patel, who batted fearlessly to score a rapid half-century off the world's fastest bowlers. After the labour against Kenya, Ponting had said he wanted to win this convincingly but it wasn't until the 29th over, by which time Canada had reached 150 for 2, that Australia began to dominate. #p#Their surge was led by the wayward Shaun Tait, who had Bagai edging to Haddin. The ball was now scruffy and had begun to reverse. In his next over, Tait wasted a review on an unsuccessful lbw appeal for the second time, not spotting an inside edge from Zubin Surkari. He floored Surkari, though, with his next two balls, a toe-crushing yorker followed by a full toss that struck the batsman painfully on the thigh. Rattled, Surkari attempted a flamboyant drive after getting back on his feet, and inside-edged on to middle stump. #p#Smart Stats Brett Lee's 4 for 46 is his second-best figures in World Cups behind his 5 for 42 against New Zealand in 2003. He has 30 wickets in 15 matches at an average of 18.53. Canada's 54 runs in the first five overs is the highest for any team in the first five overs of an innings in the 2011 World Cup. They brought up their fifty in just 4.4 overs. From a healthy score of 150 for 2, Canada collapsed to 211 losing their last eight wickets for just 61 runs. The 77 runs scored by Canada in the mandatory Powerplay is the fourth highest by any team in the World Cup. The highest is 87 by India against South Africa in Nagpur. The 183-run stand between Shane Watson and Brad Haddin is the highest opening-wicket partnership for Australia in World Cups. Haddin and Watson became the 32nd Australian pair to aggregate 1000 runs in ODIs. They have now aggregated 1131 runs at an average of 49.17 with three century stands. Watson was dismissed for the second time in the nineties in ODIs. Adam Gilchrist has been dismissed six times in the nineties which is the record for an Australia batsman. Australia won with 91 balls to spare in the innings. In matches in the 2011 World Cup, it is second to their win over New Zealand in Nagpur in terms of balls remaining. Their record remains the win over Ireland in 2007 when they had 226 balls remaining. Ricky Ponting, who has scored 1620 runs in World Cups at an average of 45 has been poor in this tournament. He has scored just 83 runs in four innings at an average under 21. #p#Between those wickets, Jason Krejza dismissed Jimmy Hansra, whose attempted hit down the ground landed in long-on's hands. Brett Lee, who bore the brunt of the early onslaught, returned to uproot Rizwan Cheema's middle stump with a slower ball. Canada lost four wickets in four overs, and five for 19, and were soon dismissed for 211. Having struggled in the field with his injured pinky, Ponting was unhappy, and his frustration showed when he collided with Steve Smith moments before catching Harvir Baidwan. Ponting flung the ball into the ground after taking the catch. #p#The build-up to the game was quiet: the Wednesday crowd was thin, the atmosphere sedentary. And then Patel woke everybody up. Using Lee's width and pace, he played two cuts. By the time you blinked, the ball had reached the boundary. He took a third four off Lee's first over with a drive through extra cover. Against Tait, who had focused on bowling full and fast without success, Patel moved back and slammed a length delivery over the cover boundary. After three overs, Canada were 33 for 0. #p#There was no memorable swansong for 40-year-old John Davison, who was playing his final game. After three attacking boundaries, he gloved a slower bouncer from Lee to Haddin, ending the opening stand on 41, Canada's best of the World Cup. #p#Davison's dismissal did not deter Patel. He brought up Canada's 50 off 4.4 overs by edging an attempted loft off Mitchell Johnson so hard that it cleared third man. Realising Patel was at ease with balls in his half, Lee unleashed several short balls and even wanted a chat, but Patel did not bite. And when Lee bowled one short ball too many, Patel hooked, and cleared deep-backward square leg. He reached his half-century off 37 deliveries, and after the mandatory Powerplay, Canada were 77 for 1. Patel's innings ended when, in the 12th over, he went hard at Watson and Johnson held the catch on the edge of the third-man boundary. #p#Australia slowly brought the run-rate under control. It finally dipped below six in the 19th over. Surkari and Bagai, however, batted steadily during their 68-run association. They steered Canada towards a commendable position before Australia's fast bowlers came back strongly - Lee finished with 4 for 46 - and set the stage for their batsmen. #p#Haddin and Watson both survived uncertain moments against the new ball before settling in to score at a steady pace. They were tested by Henry Osinde, a well built Uganda-born fast bowler who got the ball to bounce at pace and beat both Haddin and Watson with short balls. Harvir Baidwan could have dismissed Watson on 2 but Rizwan Cheema dropped the lofted mis-hit at mid-on. Haddin could have been dismissed on 23 but Ashish Bagai decided not to review an unsuccessful lbw appeal from Baidwan. Replays showed it was likely to have been overturned. #p#Thereafter opportunities for Canada were few. Haddin and Watson dominated the bowling during the batting Powerplay - 41 runs between overs 21 and 25 - and were soon finding the boundary at will. Both batsmen missed their centuries, though, holing out to catches in the deep, leaving the finish to their mates in the middle order. #p#Match Timeline

35	506539	Australia v Canada, Group A, World Cup 2011, Bangalore	Hiral Patel's timeless moment	Sriram Veera at the Chinnaswamy Stadium	March 16, 2011	Hiral Patel's back-foot six over cover off Shaun Tait may be the one shot he will be remembered by Associated Press Enlarge Related Links News : Bagai calls for regular competitive cricket Report : Rusty Australia swamp fighting Canada Players/Officials: Hiral Patel Matches: Australia v Canada at Bangalore Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Canada #p#Sometimes, we freeze an entire career of a batsman into a solitary frame of action. Kris Srikkanth's timeless square drive on a bent knee off Andy Roberts, Javed Miandad's last-ball six, Doug Walters' six off the last ball of the day to bring up a Test hundred, and Tamim Iqbal rushing down the track to lash Zaheer Khan over long-on during the 2007 World Cup. There are some shots that get tattooed on your brain forever. #p#And sometimes, just sometimes, a batsman might just be remembered for a single shot. Vikram Rathour, a very fine domestic player, never made it in international cricket, but in a mindless game in Sharjah, he played a stroke that made even Sachin Tendulkar, the non-striker at the time, turn to look at the trajectory of the ball with astonishment. It was the last ball of an over from Shaun Pollock, and Rathour leaned forward a touch and wafted his bat on the up and through the line of a short-of-length delivery and the ball went screaming over long-on. #p#On Wednesday, Hiral Patel had one such priceless moment, which a fan may bring up in some drunken chat in some pub in the future. It was a sizzling knock from Patel, filled with cuts and drives, but one shot screamed out for attention from posterity. It was a 148.5kph thunderbolt from Shaun Tait that bounced short of a length. It demanded respect, but it got insouciance. Patel just leaned back, lifted the front leg in the air and absolutely thumped it on the up and over cover for a mind-blowing six. #p#It was ballsy, impish and had a dash of an innocent arrogance that can only come from an amateur teenager. It was a shot of a lifetime, and probably will be so in the case of Patel, as Canada might disappear from the World Cup map if the ICC keeps out the Associates from the 2015 edition, and who knows what Patel will be doing in four years' time. #p#What makes the Patel moment almost magical is the context. Here is a 19-year-old kid from the cricketing backwaters of Canada, facing the fiery fast men of the World champion side. Tait, Brett Lee and Mitchell Johnson can make strong men go weak in the knees, but this kid was merrily thumping them. #p#It brought back memories of a completely contrasting player, the defensive David Steele, who was plucked out of anonymity by the England captain Tony Grieg at the age of 33 to face Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson. He wore steel-rimmed spectacles, nearly lost his way while walking out to the middle on debut at Lord's, and stirred a nation's imagination by defending the hostile men with aplomb. The Sun's Clive Taylor hailed him as "The bank clerk who went to war" Patel could well be the kid who went to war. #p#For 58 minutes, the kid stunned the grown-up men from Australia. In 45 balls, he experienced what he might never feel again: what it is like to be a conqueror of a fiery attack. Apart from that six off Tait, there was a serene shot that stood out among the adrenaline-fuelled gems. Lee had just nailed him with a sharp bouncer, which he just about managed to evade with a weak waft. That reaction made you lean forward in the seat to catch the next-ball action. Is Patel mentally strong enough to handle the next delivery? Would he retreat back, if not back away? #p#Lee too, it seems, was thinking on those lines, for he hurled the next delivery fuller and straighter to catch the batsman by surprise. Patel strode forward - it was the maximum he stretched on the front foot in the entire cameo - and creamed it through the covers. It said so much about the plucky kid. He went on to even hook Lee for a six. #p#The knock drew a lot of praise from Ricky Ponting, who even threw in a reference to Virender Sehwag. "He was savage on us. If you look at someone like Sehwag, he plays a pretty similar way to what [Patel] played today," Ponting said. "Looking at the way he plays, he's a fairly unusual sort of player in the fact that he scored probably 90% of his runs in the one area today, which was around the point, backward point area. The new ball swung a bit, which offered him a little bit of room, and that was all he needed. He accepted the room and he hit some amazing shots at the top of the innings. #p#Ponting, though, did say that part of the early shock his team suffered was due to a lack of knowledge of the opposition. "We didn't know a lot about him [Patel]. We didn't know a lot about a lot of their players, from the fact that we haven't played against a lot of them and we didn't have a lot of footage on a lot of their players either. The notes and everything we had was more about their careers stats and a few clippings on things they'd done in this tournament. We probably didn't bowl as well as we needed to." #p#Even Patel's dismissal brought a smile to your face. When he was going hammer and tongs, a couple of us journalists looked up his profile on ESPNcricinfo, written by a Canadian journalist Faraz Sarwat. It ended with this gem: "When it works it can be spectacular, but there is always the danger that Patel's innings won't amount to too much more than giving catching practice to the fielder stationed at deep third man." That is followed by a quote from the former Canada captain Sunil Dhaniram, "Hiral loves to play the cut over third man. It's his favourite shot, but he needs to be careful, though, about when he plays it" Soon, out in the middle, Hiral slashed a cut against Shane Watson and the ball settled in the palms of a fielder stationed, where else, but third man. #p#By then, though, the boy who was born in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, a state in India, and currently lives in Canada, had unfurled a memorable knock and a dreamy shot that will stand the test of time.

And when the captain shouts, ignore him at your peril. Steven Smith didn't heed that suggestion when he ran around from mid-on and Ricky Ponting was moving from mid-off to get under a skied catch struck by Harvir Baidwan. Ponting called for the take and moved into position, but Smith kept coming and the pair collided, although Ponting still managed to make the catch. But immediately he hurled the ball into the turf and walked away from Smith, not celebrating with the rest of his team-mates. "I had a chat to Smithy about it and I think we both actually called for it at exactly the same time," Ponting said later. "I was probably a bit more disappointed that a few of the other guys didn't yell out and make it clear that it was my catch. It wasn't a great reaction... if it looked bad then I apologise for it." #p#Eye-watering moment of the day Zubin Surkari might never play another World Cup match, and he'll certainly remember his last two, ahem, balls. Facing Shaun Tait must be a daunting enough experience for some of the Associate batsmen, and when Surkari saw a 146kph full toss searing towards his groin, he might have wished he'd chosen another profession. The ball smashed into Surkari's inner thigh and he collapsed in heap, writhing in pain as Tait came up and apologised. After a few minutes of recovery time, Surkari bravely got back up and batted on, but in the ultimate case of being softened up, he lost his middle stump next delivery as Tait went fast and full, and Surkari inside-edged his attempted drive. #p#Shot of the day, mark I Hiral Patel didn't have any such worries against Tait. In the third over of the match, Patel launched the most audacious slap over cover and struck the ball so cleanly that it easily cleared the boundary. And if Tait thought things were going to get any easier once Patel was out, he was wrong. Ashish Bagai, the captain, provided another contender for the shot of the day when he drove a Tait half-volley back over the bowler's head with magnificent timing, although it bounced just short of clearing the boundary. #p#Shot of the day, mark II Take your pick. Shane Watson hit four sixes in 14 balls as Australia's chase accelerated, and they just seemed to get bigger and bigger. A slog-sweep off Balaji Rao went 94 metres, and a similar shot later in the same over went 99 metres. But in the next over, Watson went 104 metres over long-on with a lofted drive off John Davison that was the biggest six of the tournament so far. The next one was only 85 metres, but the crowd still seemed to enjoy it. #p#Miss of the day I Balaji Rao had a deep midwicket placed for Shane Watson. The ego-trap was simple: If you dare, go over the fielder's head. The ball was sufficiently short to warrant a pull and turned just a tad bit to make the timing go awry. Watson went for it and seemed a goner as Nitish Kumar ran to his right at deep midwicket but he suddenly lost the plot. Perhaps blinded by the floodlights, he just gave up the catch when he had almost reached the ball. The camera panned to Balaji who went, "what the..." #p#Miss of the day II Fat men hardly get any luck on most days and the portly Balaji was twice unlucky today. He delivered a ripper that drifted towards leg and middle before turning and bouncing right across an ugly slog sweep from Brad Haddin. Alas, Ashish Bagai, a fabulous keeper, chose that very moment to slip up for probably the first time this tournament. He couldn't adjust to the extra bounce and broke the stumps without the ball in his gloves. Haddin's back foot was not inside the line and for a moment it seemed that the ball landed on the stumps but it wasn't sure whether the bails came off in time. Balaji was taken off the attack and returned later for an over, only to be walloped for two sixes by Watson.

"Cricket is mainly played by expats from India, Pakistan, West Indies, Sri Lanka and Australia and our team is representative of that cricket culture," Bagai said after Canada's loss to Australia in their last game of this World Cup. "It's important to get the locals to play if we are to get support from corporates or the government." #p#Canada doesn't have a domestic structure in place and Bagai sought help from the ICC and the Test-playing countries to improve the state of cricket in Canada. "We need to keep playing competitive cricket over the next few years. It would be great if we can have A-team tours from other countries, or get to participate in domestic competitions elsewhere." #p#Bagai pointed how all the four Associate teams have shown improvement as the tournament progressed and cited it as evidence for the need for more exposure. "The guys from the four teams have started to come out of their shells. Six games are not enough to do that. We need to keep playing competitive cricket over the next four years." #p#Some of the Canada players take part in the Sri Lankan domestic circuit, and Bagai said they needed more such initiatives; else they might lose young players like Hiral Patel. Bagai said playing on the English county circuit could do wonders, but Canada don't have an easy entry. "The European players get to play as locals in England but we need to play as overseas players and therefore it is not easy to get contracts." English counties can only play two overseas players in the domestic Twenty20 competition and one in four-day games. #p#Canada did participate in the Caribbean Twenty20 tournament in the West Indies earlier this year, and finished fourth in their group. #p#Bagai also spoke about the initiatives that the Canada board is undertaking to spread the game. "The board is trying to instill it in grass-roots levels, in schools and trying to get the locals to play." #p#Looking back at the tournament Bagai chose the bowling as the highlight. "Our bowlers were fantastic; they were world-class. Some of the young batsmen got good knocks which will hold them well in the future. They need to use it and keep working hard over the next few years. The overall experience of playing this tournament has been a great one. We have to keep improving and make Canada a lot stronger in the next five years."
35	506585	Australia v Canada, Group A, World Cup 2011, Bangalore	Australia need to lift against better teams	Brydon Coverdale at the Chinnaswamy Stadium	March 16, 2011	Ricky Ponting was miffed after Steven Smith collided with him in going for a catch Getty Images Enlarge Related Links News : Team-mates back Ponting on captaincy Report : Rusty Australia swamp fighting Canada Players/Officials: Ricky Ponting Matches: Australia v Canada at Bangalore Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Australia #p#A seven-wicket win, an Australian World Cup-record opening partnership, a 34th consecutive World Cup match without a loss. That all sounds pretty good if you're an Australian fan. But if Australia play like they did against Canada when the knockout stage begins next week, they won't be lifting the World Cup. #p#And Ricky Ponting knows it. When he collided with Steven Smith as they both positioned themselves under a skied ball in the 42nd over of Canada's innings, he held the catch but dropped his bundle. Ponting hurled the ball into the turf and walked away from the group, crouching at mid-off while his team-mates were standing beside the pitch, celebrating the wicket. #p#The captain had called for the catch and felt that Smith hadn't listened, and his team-mates hadn't called at Smith to stop. It wasn't a good look for Ponting to turn his back on his young colleague, but he had cause to be frustrated. His men were making errors and for the second time in four days an Associate nation was making them look average. On Sunday against Kenya, they could blame rust, after a fortnight off. On Wednesday, they were just sloppy. #p#And against Pakistan on Saturday, and potentially the likes of India or South Africa next week, that won't cut it. Impressive as Hiral Patel was, he is no Virender Sehwag, and Henry Osinde is no Dale Steyn. Yet these men, just like Collins Obuya and Nehemiah Odhiambo at the weekend, found weaknesses in Ponting's outfit, including the fact that later in the evening the captain was out hooking yet again, this time to Osinde. #p#Fortunately for Shane Watson and Brad Haddin, luck was on their side. Watson should have been caught in Harvir Baidwan's first over when he skied a chance to mid-on, and Haddin nearly played on to Osinde and then survived a perfect lbw shout that Canada should have reviewed. The openers were loose and lazy early, but they were wonderful later, and that is the one great positive Australia can take. #p#In the field, they lacked polish. In the lead-up to the tournament, the former swing bowler Damien Fleming said Australia could be bowling teams out for 50 or chasing 500. And when the Canadian top order slapped and sliced their way to the fastest team half-century of the World Cup, getting there in 4.4 overs, it seemed that Fleming's throwaway line wasn't so far from the truth. #p#That's the risk of playing Shaun Tait, Brett Lee and Mitchell Johnson. As Canada showed, their speed can be used against them. Lee ended up with four wickets, but in his new-ball spell varied between being too full with no swing, and too short and inaccurate. Against Patel and John Davison it was costly enough, but a class opener like Sehwag or Chris Gayle could have massacred that bowling. #p#The Australians chose not to give John Hastings a game against Canada, but Watson demonstrated why variety in the seam attack is valuable. As soon as Watson came on the runs dried up. He was accurate, consistent and took the pace off the ball - which cost Patel his wicket when he went for an upper cut that landed in third man's hands. #p#But Watson himself had moments he'd rather forget, like when he spilled a catch at slip off Karl Whatham's edge. There were other mistakes with the ball and in the field: Michael Hussey grassed a hard chance above his head in the first over and then gave away overthrows with an unnecessary throw at the stumps, while Johnson, as he often does, bowled a couple of balls that barely made it on to Hawk-Eye's pitch map. #p#It all added up to a mixed-bag of a performance, though the way the Canadian lower order struggled and Australia's openers gradually found their touch, it turned Australia's way. Ponting knows that against Pakistan, on Saturday, they need to prove they can beat a quality side. #p#"Against better teams and deeper batting orders, we have to make sure we don't let teams get off to that sort of start," Ponting said. "If you look at someone like Sehwag, he plays a pretty similar way to what [Patel] played today, and if we happen to let him get off to a start like that in a big game, it's going to be a whole lot harder to peg them back. We've got some work to do, but I don't think we're that far away. We'll get a better indication when we take on a good team in a couple of days' time." #p#At least when Australia's players walked off after they bowled Canada out, Ponting gave Smith a pat on the back. All's well that ends well, but if they don't lift, their World Cup will be ending well before they want it to finish.
35	506630			Darshini Ravishankar		Choice of game I picked the Australia-Canada game mainly because tickets were easily available, but we were also hoping for an Ireland-style World Cup upset, however slim the chances were of that happening. Since it was a weekday and a non-India game the stadium was 70% empty, so my father and I had lots of seats to ourselves, and could stretch out and watch the game in total peace. #p# Team supported Canada, as they needed all the support they could get. It also helped that nearly all the players were of subcontinental origin, almost like a second Indian team. Whenever Balaji Rao came on to bowl, the few thousand in the stadium roared like they were present in full strength. Shame I couldn't buy any Canada flags, though. #p# World Cup prediction South Africa are my bet, as they have the most fearsome bowlers (they're the only team so far to take all 10 wickets in each match!) and most of their batsmen are in great form, like Australia's. There isn't any superficial hype surrounding them, unlike India, and they seem like such a happy, united team. Australia seem stronger at the moment but I think it's someone else's cup this year. #p# Key performer Hiral Patel, for the way he surprised everyone with his 54 off 45 balls. No one expected Canada to make as much as they did in 10 overs. In fact, when we entered the stadium, the man at the ticket counter told us that he hoped Canada would bat first so that he could go home by 5pm. #p# Shane Watson and Brad Haddin played really well, too, even though they bored everybody in the ground for the first 10 overs of the Australian innings. They played responsibly, and showed no impatience, and when they finally started smashing sixes to all parts of the ground, they looked like there was no dismissing them. When they did get out, their wickets looked like gifts to the Canadians. #p# One thing I'd have changed There was no parking around the Chinnaswamy Stadium, so we had to park our vehicle close to the nearby Kanteerva stadium and walk back. Then we had to walk 1.5 kms to collect our tickets, and walk all around the ground again to enter it. By the time we finally got past security, who repeatedly asked us whether we had photography equipment, and into our stand, we were quite irritated. I don't understand the no-photography rule. It seems to rob cricket fans of an important part of the experience of watching a game - preserving memories of it. #p# Face-off I relished Shaun Tait versus Ashish Bagai, the Canadian captain, was interesting. Bagai's straight, lofted four against Tait, and then a similar shot off the next ball (which was stopped at the boundary) were treats to watch. Tait got Bagai in the 28th over, caught behind off a short, wide ball that he needn't have tried to slash. #p# Wow moment There were several pariah kites swooping around the stadium, chasing what looked to me like pigeons. The floodlights were on, and one dived incredibly quickly down to the ground, blocking the light for a second, and veered back up in a flash. #p# Close encounter Cameron White fielded close to the west boundary, where we were, occasionally scowling up at our seats. There were a few who heckled him, calling him "Blackie"- which wasn't tasteful or funny. #p# John Davison and Harvir Baidwan patrolled our boundary during Australia's innings. The latter gave us small waves and a sheepish sort of grin, and John Davison smiled at the crowd often. The same characters who heckled White kept saying, "Davey, Davey, hogi bowling maadi!" ("Go bowl some!") #p# Accessories A pair of binoculars came in handy for watching the batsmen's grips, the expression of the captain when catches were dropped, and the pariah kites. #p# Shot of the day Shane Watson's huge slog-swept six, which went at least 10 rows back into the stand next to the pavilion. From where I was sitting I could see the arc of the ball's path perfectly as it flew from Watson's bat to the ground many, many metres away. #p# Crowd meter The stands were nearly empty, but the east section filled up steadily as Canada's innings came to a close. But the way the crowd yelled when the big screen announced the "city scream contest" belied the numbers the stadium held - it was as loud as anything I've ever heard in a cricket stadium. It would have been nice to see more people. From the outside one could hardly tell a match was going on, let alone a World Cup match. #p# Entertainment The music got better as the sky darkened, but the PA system wasn't very good. A mixture of Kannada, Tamil, Hindi, and English songs were played, and as a rule they were all hits, with throbbing beats and somewhat random lyrics. There was one extremely enthusiastic man a few rows in front of me who would dance even when no music was played, and kept up the energy until the very last ball. The drummers along the boundary did a great job building up the atmosphere. #p# There was some rather contrived entertainment during the break between the innings - an overly happy emcee supervised some catching, fielding, and batting contests, while the World Cup's neglected mascot, Stumpy the elephant, lumbered around the ground waving his bat and looking very cuddly. #p# ODIs v Twenty20 Each has its charm. An ODI is like a day-long picnic, and it requires more skill than a Twenty20. In my opinion, even weightlifters can play a Twenty20 - all they need to do is touch ball with bat and it will fly for a six. But yes, Twenty20s are more entertaining. #p# Marks out of 10 6, for the difficulty we had getting to the match, and for the certainty about the result. It was a fun experience, and I hope that I can go to more World Cup matches the next time around. #p# Overall The first half of the Canada innings was splendid, but their mild collapse was disappointing, though not unexpected. Their fielding was just bad, what with the dropped catch, missed run-outs and lack of diving. The Australian bowling reined Canada in very well and very quickly, and their batting never looked like it was going to fail. #p# The food provided at the stadium was good - drinks, sandwiches, samosas, bhajjis (fried snacks), fruit salad, and chips were available - and the placards and inflatable clappers were a nice touch. The new plasma screen was well-positioned and gave us all the information we needed. The stadium also looked cleaner than before. #p# Every player was cheered, every wicket and boundary was greeted, and the stadium staff was polite and helpful. The Australians and Canadians seemed like they were having a great deal of fun and spoke to each other often. At the end of the match, John Davison was congratulated by nearly all the players on the field, and everyone was smiling.
36	506494	England v West Indies, World Cup 2011, Chennai	Sammy eyes Caribbean revival	Dileep Premachandran in Chennai	March 16, 2011	#p#Of the current squad, only Shivnarine Chanderpaul - barely old enough to hold a bat - was around the last time West Indies beat England in the World Cup. A few might have watched footage of what Vivian Richards, Collis King and Joel Garner did to England in that Lord's final of 1979, and Darren Sammy, the captain, hopes that this campaign could mark the turning point in the fortunes of a side whose fall from grace is one of sport's more sobering stories. #p#"It's massive for us as cricketers," he said on the eve of the England game. "We came here as underdogs and we've managed to stay focussed. If we manage to achieve our ultimate goal, it'll be a huge boost for the people of the Caribbean." #p#In what is undoubtedly the tougher of the two groups, West Indies were the team many expected to slip up against the lesser sides. Instead, they disposed of Ireland and Netherlands quite comfortably and gave Bangladesh the kind of pasting that the teams led by Lloyd and Richards were famed for. #p#In contrast, England have slipped on both banana peels placed in their path. If they fail to register a fifth consecutive World Cup win against West Indies tomorrow, their Phileas Fogg-like adventure that started last November with a flight to Australia will be over. #p#Sammy isn't someone you associate with mental-disintegration tactics, but there was certainly an element of sledge to his thoughts on where the English stand right now. "It's a good time to play them," he said. "They've been on the road a long time. I saw somewhere that they've had four days at home in the last five months. Maybe some of them want to go home to their families. You never know." #p#Darren Sammy has been vocal about his team's chances against England Getty Images Enlarge #p#On another grass-free and bone-hard pitch, West Indies are boosted by the return of Chris Gayle. Kieron Pollard has been their big-hitting star in recent games, but a Gayle special of the kind that flattened South Africa in a Champions Trophy semi-final (2006) is near inevitable at some point during the competition. #p#Sammy himself has excelled with the ball while disappointing with the bat. With Dwayne Bravo now back home nursing his injured knee, it's all the more important that he finds his scoring touch soon. "Every game we've played, one player stands up," said Sammy. "I'd like to think a big innings is around the corner." #p#Having lost every toss so far, he isn't unduly concerned about it, though it does look the sort of surface where you want to bat first. And while others, and Graeme Swann in particular, have been vocal about the dew factor in some games, Sammy wasn't fussed. "We've managed it quite well," he said. "You just get a towel and wipe the ball. Simple." #p#Swann is one bowler West Indies will need to be especially wary of though, with four left-handers in their top five. "He has been England's premier bowler," said Sammy. "No one can question what he's done over the last two years. But he's also human. We have batsmen capable of dominating." #p#The West Indies view Ottis Gibson's experiences as England's bowling coach as one more point in their favour - "He's aware of weaknesses and we'll look to exploit them tomorrow" - though they're unlikely to change the combination of Kemar Roach's pace and Sulieman Benn's spin that has worked so well for them with the new ball. #p#Having watched Imran Tahir excel against England at this very venue a little over a week ago, West Indies will no doubt be tempted to try a leggie themselves. "It's food for thought," said Sammy, "whether we should play [Devendra] Bishoo tomorrow." #p#After two devastating innings against "lesser" opposition, this is also Pollard's chance to show that there's more to him lucrative IPL contracts. "Kieron and I had a chat, about finding the best place for him," said Sammy. "We worked out where he feels most comfortable." #p#If England's bowlers fail to find their length, and bowl as they did against Ireland and Bangladesh, Pollard could literally hit them out of the competition. Even the pretty pagoda-like structures at the top of the new stands won't be safe.
36	506497	WI v England, World Cup 2011, Group B, Chennai	Chaotic entertainers face the final curtain	The Preview by Andrew Miller	March 16, 2011	#p#Match Facts March 17, Chennai Start time 2.30pm (0900 GMT) #p#Stretched to the limit: James Anderson could pay the price for his poor form in the tournament to date Associated Press Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: James Anderson | Chris Gayle | Andrew Strauss | Graeme Swann Matches: England v West Indies at Chennai Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: England | West Indies #p#The Big Picture #p#"Did I entertain you?" was the poignant sign-off that Brian Lara uttered at Barbados four years ago, after his final international appearance had ended with a cruel run-out and a one-wicket defeat at the hands of England in the 2007 World Cup. The same question - and the same affirmative answer - would undoubtedly apply to England's chaotic campaigners this time around. Then as now, the players in question are braced for a humiliating early exit from the grandest of global tournaments, but given the treats they've served up so far, there's no doubt they'll be missed if they fail to scrape into the knock-out stages. #p#After five cliffhangers in five contests, the permutations are simple. Anything less than a victory, and England are gone, eliminated in embarrassing fashion for the fifth World Cup in succession. Even if they do rally themselves for one last push towards qualification, it might yet be a futile gesture, with Bangladesh and West Indies in a position to squeeze England back down to fifth spot if they can both win their final fixtures against South Africa and India respectively. It's an "arse-nipper", as Graeme Swann succinctly put it earlier this week. But England being England, they wouldn't settle for anything less. #p#However this make-or-break fixture pans out, England are sure to be recalled as the story of this World Cup, for without them what would the point of this first month have been? While the big guns in Group A have chugged effortlessly to the last four, Group B has been a thrill-a-minute with three of the four qualifiers still to be decided. That is thanks almost entirely to the fluctuating standards of an England squad that has forgotten how to close out a contest - no matter what the calibre of opposition may be. Mental exhaustion is clearly a factor, but the adrenaline of impending elimination may aid them in their bid for survival. #p#After their miserable stop-over in Chittagong, the squad has limped back to Chennai, the scene of their finest performance of the tournament to date, even if the finesse was limited to the final 16 overs of their effort in the field. A two-paced and spin-friendly wicket enabled England's bowlers to tap into some long-forgotten knowhow from their Ashes victory in Australia, although their batsmen had already steered them into familiarly choppy waters in being bowled out for 171 in 45.4 overs. #p#Quite what West Indies will make of such maverick opposition is anyone's guess. With ferocious hitters such as Chris Gayle and Kieron Pollard in their ranks, allied to the more conventional class of Darren Bravo, they are more than capable of shredding a bowling attack that has slipped onto auto-pilot all too frequently. Meanwhile the pace of Kemar Roach and the competitiveness of Sulieman Benn provide an edge with the ball that cannot be underestimated, as Bangladesh among others can testify. #p#A fortnight ago in Dhaka, West Indies routed Bangladesh for 58, one match before those same Bangladeshi batsmen put the skids under England's campaign with a thrilling two-wicket victory in Chittagong. Likewise, the same South African outfit that crumbled to a six-run defeat against England put West Indies firmly in their place in their opening match of the group stage, with AB de Villiers' century easing them to a seven-wicket win. #p#If England have lost the games they were expected to win, and vice versa, West Indies have taken a much more sedate route towards the quarter-finals. They are not there yet by any means, and could face an anxious final game against India if they don't come up with the goods in this contest. But come 2.30pm on Thursday, it'll be time to board the rollercoaster once again. Given what we've seen from West Indies' opponents so far in the competition, this one promises to be emotional. #p#Form guide (completed matches, most recent first) West Indies WWWLL England LWLTW #p#Watch out for... Against South Africa last week, Chennai provided a surface that Graeme Swann would wish to roll up and lug with him around the subcontinent (although the number of internal flights might persuade him to dump it somewhere in transit...) With sharp turn and vicious bounce, it was Swann's spell that sowed the first seeds of doubt in South Africa's hitherto serene progress, and though he picked up the solitary wicket of Graeme Smith, his efforts emboldened every other member of the attack. The scenario was markedly different against Bangladesh in Chittagong, however, when the dew-sodden surface denied him what he felt were his just rewards, and led to a 10% fine for an audible outburst. With more floodlights in prospect, he might hope to get through his stint in the first innings. #p#Kieron Pollard has a career average of 21.87 in 36 ODIs, figures which scarcely do justice to the hype he has attracted in his short career, particularly in the Twenty20 format. But in a nip-and-tuck contest against Ireland last week, he unfurled his full repertoire in a savage and game-changing onslaught. His 94 from 55 balls included a ballistic tempo-change in the Batting Powerplay, a facet of the game that England have consistently failed to exploit. If England's bowlers fail to nail their lengths - and who knows what length works for a man with such a keen eye? - he is capable of ending their campaign in a matter of overs. #p#Team news Injuries were England's biggest problem in the early stages of the tournament, but now it is illness that is undermining their preparations. Andrew Strauss and Graeme Swann both missed training on Tuesday, although they are expected to be fit, while attention now turns to Ajmal Shahzad, who bowled three jaffas and a lot of dross against Bangladesh, but nevertheless looked their most potent source of wickets. If he is deemed unfit, then James Anderson could earn a reprieve after reports in the press had suggested he was set for the axe. Chris Tremlett's suspect temperament held up well in extreme circumstances in the Ashes, but this would be quite a cauldron for his maiden outing of the campaign. #p#England (possible) 1 Andrew Strauss (capt), 2 Matt Prior (wk), 3 Jonathan Trott, 4 Ian Bell, 5 Eoin Morgan, 6 Ravi Bopara, 7 Tim Bresnan, 8 Paul Collingwood, 9 Graeme Swann, 10 Ajmal Shahzad/James Anderson, 11 Chris Tremlett. #p#Chris Gayle missed the Ireland victory with an abdominal strain but he is expected to reclaim his place at the top of the order. Nikita Miller is the first-choice spin twin for Sulieman Benn, although the success of Imran Tahir in the England game has tempted Darren Sammy to consider a wristy of his own. "It's food for thought," said Sammy, "whether we should play [Devendra] Bishoo tomorrow." #p#West Indies (possible) 1 Chris Gayle, 2 Devon Smith, 3 Darren Bravo, 4 Ramnaresh Sarwan, 5 Shivnarine Chanderpaul, 6 Kieron Pollard, 7 Darren Sammy (capt), 8 Devon Thomas (wk), 9 Nikita Miller, 10 Sulieman Benn, 11 Kemar Roach. #p#Try picking the XIs for tomorrow's game by playing Team Selector. #p#Pitch and conditions Strauss anticipates another low turner, which may yet influence the selection of an extra spinner, although neither Michael Yardy nor James Tredwell are treated with much confidence at present. #p#Stats and trivia #p#England and West Indies have faced each other on five previous occasions in World Cup history, although West Indies' only victory came in their first encounter, in the 1979 final at Lord's. #p#The teams have faced each other on three previous occasions in India - in the 1987 World Cup, in the 1989 Nehru Cup, and in the 2006 Champions Trophy.

36	506502	England v West Indies, World Cup 2011, Chennai	Strauss dismisses fatigue factor	Siddarth Ravindran in Chennai	March 16, 2011	#p#"This is a good time to play England, they have been on the road a long time, in order to stay on in India they have to win," West Indies captain Darren Sammy said on Wednesday, before joking, "Maybe some of them want to go home to their families, you never know." #p#Much has been made of the England team having spent only four days at home since late October when they departed to Australia for a dominant Ashes campaign. The continuous crush of high-profile cricket combined with the heat and humidity of the subcontinent seems to have taken its toll on the squad, with a string of players picking up fitness problems. #p#The fast bowler Ajmal Shahzad is the latest casualty, missing Wednesday's practice session at the MA Chidambaram Stadium after falling ill. It is still unclear whether he will recover in time for the must-win match against West Indies on Thursday. "We are not sure at this stage whether that will affect Shahzad's chances of being selected for tomorrow," England captain Andrew Strauss said. Shahzad had taken three wickets in the match against Bangladesh in Chittagong on Friday, and his possible absence increases the chances of James Anderson retaining his place in the XI. #p#There was better news for England regarding two other key players who were struggling with their fitness, with Strauss and offspinner Graeme Swann both recovering from the stomach bug that preventing them from training on Tuesday. "I'm feeling very well, I was a bit laid low day before night and yesterday morning," Strauss said. "Swann is also recovering well, should be practising today, don't know if he is quite as buoyant as I am, very confident that he'll be fine for tomorrow." #p#Chris Tremlett could join Tim Bresnan in the England side if Ajmal Shahzad's illness doesn't clear Getty Images Enlarge #p#Their most consistent batsman of the tournament, Jonathan Trott, had also been a member of their sick list earlier this week before recovering from a fever. These concerns are in addition to losing influential players Stuart Broad and Kevin Pietersen to injuries. Pietersen's tweet outlining the bright side to his injury added to the claims of homesickness. "Well, as frustrated as I am to be missing the rest of the World Cup & IPL, I'll be at home with my family & friends, I haven't been home properly since 29 Oct.," he had written after being ruled out of the tournament. #p#Strauss, though, was adamant the time way from home and the amount of cricket England have played over the past six months were not affecting their performance. "We have been on the road for a long time, but fatigue is the last thing on our mind," he said. "Potentially we have got four more games to play before a nice, long break." #p#The illnesses were common for teams touring the subcontinent, he said. "It's happened to a lot of the sides in this tournament, that guys go down. It's par for the course in this part of the world, we try and take all the precautions, but these things can strike at any stage." #p#He said the motivation of keeping the campaign for a first World Cup alive was motivation enough for his side. "We know what the prize there is. We are determined to make the most of the opportunity and take that prize," he said. "Fatigue is not an issue for us at the moment, and it won't be until right at the end of the tournament." #p#The end of the tournament could come as early as Thursday, giving Strauss' team two extra weeks of rest at home, unless they round off their league phase with a win against West Indies and results out of their control go their way.
36	506512	England v West Indies, World Cup 2011, Chennai	West Indies bank on Gayle factor	Madhusudhan Ramakrishnan	March 16, 2011	Chris Gayle has hit more ODI hundreds in India than any other visiting batsman AFP Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: Chris Gayle Matches: England v West Indies at Chennai Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: England | West Indies Grounds: MA Chidambaram Stadium #p#Shock defeats against Ireland and Bangladesh, and Bangladesh's subsequent win over Netherlands, have left England in a must-win situation in their final group game against West Indies. The two teams come into this crucial fixture having had contrasting runs of form. While West Indies have had a more consistent run so far, their wins have come against the lower-ranked teams. A heavy loss to South Africa in their first game was followed by three relatively easy wins against Netherlands, Bangladesh and Ireland. In what was expected to be a tight game against Bangladesh, West Indies bowled the hosts out for just 58 and wrapped up a comfortable victory. #p#England, on the other hand, performed very poorly against Bangladesh and Ireland but raised their game against India and South Africa. While their game against India ended in a high-scoring tie in Bangalore, they kept their nerve to triumph by six runs in a low-scoring encounter against South Africa in Chennai. Their performance against top teams and the win in Chennai should give England some confidence ahead of the do-or-die clash, despite the various concerns with illness and fatigue. #p#England also have an excellent record against West Indies in global tournaments. After the loss in the 1979 World Cup final, their only other loss came in the Champions Trophy final in 2004. The previous meeting in the World Cup ended in a one-wicket win for England. England will, however, miss Kevin Pietersen, who top-scored in their previous two wins against West Indies in global tournaments. England, who were second-best in head-to-head ODIs before 2005, have been the better team since and have capitalised on the consistent decline of West Indies. #p#England v West Indies in ODIs Played Won Lost W/L ratio Overall 82 37 41 0.90 Between Jan 1990 and Dec 2004 37 15 18 0.82 Since Jan 2005 12 8 4 2.00 In World Cup 5 4 1 4.00 Champions Trophy 2 1 1 1.00 #p#In home ODIs since the start of 2008, England have been the better batting side, with a higher average and run-rate. West Indies have been slightly more economical, although their bowling average is higher. Both teams have been ordinary in away ODIs in the same period, particularly West Indies, who have a win-loss ratio of 0.31. The huge difference between the batting and bowling averages is an indication of West Indies' troubles in recent years. However, West Indies have one of the best records among visiting teams in ODIs in India. England, on the other hand, have won just seven and lost 16 of the ODIs played in India since 2000. #p#Batting and bowling records of both teams Team Period Matches W/L ratio Runs/wicket (batting) Run rate Runs/wicket (bowling) Economy rate Average diff Run rate diff England(home) 2008-2011 32 1.14 30.97 5.28 28.94 5.00 2.03 0.28 West Indies(home) 2008-2011 32 0.57 29.41 5.15 30.35 4.95 -0.94 0.20 England(away) 2008-2011 40 0.76 30.87 5.21 33.17 5.48 -2.30 -0.27 West Indies(away) 2008-2011 33 0.31 26.11 4.96 34.27 5.21 -8.16 -0.25 England(in India) 2000-2011 20 0.33 26.48 5.12 38.37 5.45 -11.91 -0.33 West Indies(in India) 2000-2011 19 1.11 37.96 5.31 33.75 5.29 4.21 0.02 #p#England, having started with impressive batting performances against Netherlands and India, collapsed for low scores against South Africa and Bangladesh. Eoin Morgan, Pietersen's replacement, was superb against Bangladesh, but Pietersen could be missed because of his excellent record in matches against West Indies in big tournaments. Andrew Strauss, who scored a superb century against India in the tie in Bangalore, has been the highest run-getter in ODIs for England since 2008. Ian Bell and the exceptionally consistent Jonathan Trott form the core of a powerful England middle order. #p#Chris Gayle has been the mainstay of West Indies' batting for more than seven years now. Since 2008, he has been their highest run-getter in ODIs, with nearly 1800 runs at an average of 40 and a strike-rate approaching 100. Shivnarine Chanderpaul, playing his fifth World Cup, along with the experienced Ramnaresh Sarwan, needs to make bigger contributions for West Indies to progress further in the tournament. The class of Darren Bravo and the power hitting of Kieron Pollard is a big plus for a West Indian batting line-up that is missing Adrian Barath and Dwayne Bravo. #p#Gayle, one of the most explosive openers in ODIs, has been central to West Indies' fortunes in major matches over the years. Of his 19 centuries, nine have been scored in ODI defeats, which is second only to Sachin Tendulkar's tally of 13 centuries in defeats. Gayle has a stunning record in India with over 1000 runs at an average of 56.52. In the Champions Trophy 2006 in India, Gayle scored 101 in a close loss against England and a match-winning 133 in the semi-final against South Africa. He also took the game away from Australia in the World Twenty20 in 2009 with a quickfire 88 off 50 balls. Gayle has scored at over five runs per over against both pace and spin in the last few years and will be the key batsman in the important clash. #p#The Gayle factor Matches Runs 100 50 Average Strike rate Overall 226 8036 19 43 39.20 83.68 in India 21 1074 6 3 56.52 92.16 v England 24 903 2 4 43.00 79.91 in global tournaments 32 1248 4 4 43.03 82.37 #p#Tim Bresnan and Graeme Swann have been the standout bowlers in an otherwise uninspiring England bowling attack. The loss of Stuart Broad, the highest wicket-taker in the last three years, has been a major one. James Anderson, who has conceded more than 70 on two occasions in this tournament and been very expensive overall, bowled superbly to secure a victory in the tight game against South Africa. On a track in Chennai likely to assist spin, England might be tempted to play Swann and the accurate Michael Yardy. #p#Kemar Roach's quality pace and Sulieman Benn's variations have provided West indies with quality options in their bowling. Benn especially has been very hard to score off because of his height and trajectory, and will be a threat on a spin-friendly Chennai track. With Darren Sammy, Pollard and Gayle capable of some restrictive bowling, the West Indies attack is a fairly useful one in subcontinent conditions. #p#England have been the better batting side across different phases of an innings in the last three years. While they have scored at a higher rate in the first 15 overs, West Indies have been more economical. The teams are more evenly matched in the middle overs in terms of their batting and bowling run-rates. West Indies have been the better side in the final overs, with a run-rate difference of 0.17 as compared to England, who have a corresponding figure of -0.22. #p#Performance across the innings for both teams in all matches since 2008 Team Period(overs) Batting average Run rate Bowling average Economy rate Run rate difference England 0-15 40.02 5.02 38.43 4.93 0.09 West Indies 0-15 35.24 4.54 35.33 4.79 -0.25 England 16-40 34.79 4.88 32.94 4.88 0.00 West Indies 16-40 28.56 4.86 39.91 4.80 0.06 England 41-50 18.55 7.12 22.24 7.34 -0.22 West Indies 41-50 17.09 7.20 21.74 7.03 0.17 #p#Chennai, the venue for the game, has been one of the few bowler-friendly venues in India over the last few years. Among Indian grounds that have hosted at least eight matches since 2000, Chennai has had the lowest runs scored per wicket. It has been the one of the best venues for pace bowlers and spinners over the years. Since 2000, teams batting first have won three matches and lost four. There has been no significant advantage in batting first in day-night games either: in the last four day-night matches, the wins have been shared equally between the team batting first and the team chasing.
36	506556	WI v England, World Cup 2011, Group B, Chennai	Topsy-turvy England aim to finish the right way up	Siddarth Ravindran in Chennai	March 16, 2011	On their knees: England can feel the World Cup slipping away from them after an extraordinary campaign Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: James Anderson | Andrew Strauss Matches: England v West Indies at Chennai Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: England | West Indies #p#Over the past ten months, England have achieved their loftiest ambitions in two formats of the game: they were crowned Twenty20 champions after a convincing run in the Caribbean, and retained the Ashes in Australia with a commanding victory over Ricky Ponting's men. In pursuing the highest honour in the third format, however, they have been wildly inconsistent, and are now on the verge of exiting in the first stage of a tournament that was designed to coddle the big boys. #p#The league phase was supposed to be a month-long snoozefest, in which the smaller teams in world cricket enjoyed some time in the limelight before ceding the stage to the established powers for a high-stakes final fortnight. #p#The memo clearly didn't reach England, who have put together the most topsy-turvy league campaign in World Cup history, both in terms of the results - defeats to lower-ranked Ireland and Bangladesh, while taking points off the group favourites, India and South Africa - and in terms of the heart-stopping highs and lows of each match itself. Their most humdrum game was their opening victory in Nagpur, and even that came after the no-hopers from Netherlands had set a stiff target of 293. #p#In every match in which England have dropped points, they were in a dominant position before frittering their advantage away: Zaheer Khan's reverse-swing turned the game against India after England had muscled their way to 281 to 2 at the Chinnaswamy; a pink-haired Kevin O'Brien scripted Ireland's greatest day in cricket after they were headed for a thrashing at 111 for 5 chasing 328, and a nerveless Shafiul Islam carved 24 quick runs to stop Bangladesh fans from pouring out of the Chittagong stadium, and start partying in it. #p#"I just think we haven't played a good 100-over match," Jonathan Trott said. "We haven't played consistently both sides - we've been good with the ball and poor with the bat, great with the bat and poor with the ball. The bowlers bailed us out against South Africa. As a batting unit we've got to put our heads down and get a big score, or chase down whatever West Indies set." #p#One of the reasons for England's troubles is the batting Powerplay, a concept that has injected unpredictability into the tournament as most teams have struggled to use it properly. The best that England have managed against the Test teams in the group is a poor 33 for 2 against Bangladesh, while against India they lost the plot and nearly the match with a collapse of 4 for 25. In a low-scoring tussle against South Africa, they used it too late to cause any damage. #p#"It changes a batsman's mindset, the opposition team brings their best bowlers on," Strauss said. "I don't think we have done it as well as we would have liked, but hopefully that will change, it's certainly an important period of play in the match, but it's only five overs out of 50." #p#Related to the Powerplay botch-up is the lack of runs from the lower order. Duncan Fletcher's near-obsession with making the bowlers handy with the bat has meant England's tail has been productive over the past decade, but in this World Cup the fall of their fourth wicket has generally been the precursor to a collapse. Some mighty hits from the bowlers rescued a point in Bangalore, but there have been few runs from the lower-middle order onwards in the past three matches. #p#The absence of Stuart Broad for the remainder of the tournament with a side strain exacerbates the problem, but it is his fast bowling that will be missed more, as the other experienced quick bowler in the squad, James Anderson, is badly out of form. His mastery of swing with the red ball was one of the main reasons for England's Ashes victory, but he has been lacking that control with the white ball. The nadir was perhaps the 91 runs he leaked against India, but he was also wasteful at the death when Bangladesh were on the ropes at Chittagong, serving up a nine-ball over when line and length was essential. #p#Strauss had to deflect plenty of questions over Anderson's form in Tuesday's press conference, and whether the fast bowler plays in a campaign-defining match against West Indies could now depend on the unwell Ajmal Shahzad's availability. "Jimmy has had a tough time in some of the matches in the World Cup," Strauss said, "but we all know what a quality performer he is, he's done it for us over and over again in course of the winter and previously, so his name is very much in the mix for selection." #p#Anderson had scrambled a crucial leg-bye the last time these two teams met in the World Cup, in Barbados four years ago , in a match would have fitted perfectly with England's nerve-shredding run in 2011 - they prevailed with one wicket and a ball to spare. That victory meant that the Test opponent against whom England have their best win-loss record in World Cups is West Indies. It's hard to say whether that's good news or bad for England fans, given their side's extraordinary showing over the past month.

36	506646	West Indies v England, World Cup 2011, Group B, Chennai	England stay alive in another thriller	The Report by Andrew Miller	March 17, 2011	#p#England 243 (Trott 47, Russell 4-49) beat West Indies 225 (Russell 49, Tredwell 4-48) by 18 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details #p#Staying alive: England's crazy campaigners live to fight another day Getty Images Enlarge Related Links News : Bangladesh face uphill task after England win Players/Officials: James Anderson | Devendra Bishoo | Chris Gayle | Andrew Strauss | James Tredwell | Luke Wright Matches: England v West Indies at Chennai Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: England | West Indies #p#In a campaign of ludicrously slender margins, England gave themselves a fighting chance of reaching the World Cup quarter-finals after emerging victorious by 18 runs in a monstrous battle of wills against West Indies at Chennai. In a contest that fully lived up to the "arse-nipper" billing that Graeme Swann had given it beforehand, England once again teetered on the brink of oblivion before the spin of Swann and James Tredwell hauled them back into contention in a sensational denouement. Needing 244 for victory, West Indies were coasting on 222 for 6, before losing their last four wickets for three runs in 21 deliveries. #p#It was a finale that would have been remarkable in any other context, but coming from a team that has managed to turn each of its six qualifying fixtures into horror-shows best viewed from behind the sofa through cracks in the fingers, it was a conclusion that teetered towards self-parody. Following a schizophrenic batting performance, in which Jonathan Trott shed his demure image to crash six fours from his first nine balls, England themselves crashed from 121 for 2 to 151 for 6, before Luke Wright justified his first call-up of the campaign with a vital 44. Their eventual total was at least 30 runs below par, but not for the first time, the team's fighting spirit made up for it lacked in planning and application. #p#West Indies' reply was a tale of three cameos. Between them, Chris Gayle and Darren Sammy slammed 84 runs from 50 balls, while Andre Russell launched his own innings with 45 from 30 before going into his shell after a hugely controversial reprieve on the long-on boundary. While those three were cutting loose, aided and abetted by a string of silent partners, not least the obstinate Ramnaresh Sarwan, it was clear that England had no option but to take all ten wickets to progress. #p#Cue the spinners - one whose last dew-sodden performance had resulted in an ICC fine for an audible display of petulance; the other whose solitary appearance of the winter came in a forgotten ODI at Hobart back in January. Between them Swann and Tredwell scalped seven of the first nine wickets, including three in the last 11 balls of their allocation, before a sharp throw from fine leg sealed the victory with Sulieman Benn well short. #p#That it was Trott who delivered the decisive throw was fitting, because it was his superb catch running round at cow corner that looked to have removed Russell for 39 and turned the contest in England's favour at 204 for 7. However, as he landed Trott's momentum slid him agonisingly close to the boundary rope, and though the fielder insisted he had taken the ball cleanly, the third umpire overturned the decision and Russell came back to the crease with six more runs to his name. #p#It was a moment that might have knocked the stuffing out of lesser sides, but England's bottle is the one aspect of their cricket that cannot be questioned after the events of the past month. Chastised by his let-off, Russell added a further four runs from 16 deliveries before Tredwell, whose three top-order breakthroughs had given England a glimmer, nailed him lbw as he attempted to work a single to leg. One ball later, Benn survived a referral by the skin of his bails as he padded up to a straight one, but England had the bit between their teeth and the desperation to make their opportunity count. #p#Smart Stats This was England's fifth win over West Indies in World Cups and their sixth in global tournaments. They have lost only two matches to West Indies in major tournaments. While England scored 92 runs in boundaries, West Indies were far more attacking, scoring 126 runs in fours and sixes. Graeme Swann and James Tredwell picked up seven wickets for 84 runs in 20 overs. Tim Bresnan and Chris Tremlett, on the other hand, did not pick up a single wicket and conceded 93 runs in 12 overs. The 4 for 48 is Tredwell's best bowling performance in ODIs. West Indies had their best performance in the first ten overs of the innings in the 2011 World Cup scoring 78 for 2. Andre Russell followed up his 4 for 49 with 49 off 46 balls. He missed out on becoming only the eighth player to score a fifty and pick up four wickets in a World Cup game. #p#Though Strauss might have been tempted to wait for the tailender Benn to come onto strike, he decided there was no time to wait and unleashed Swann's final over on the well-set Sarwan, who had been in the toilet at the fall of the first wicket but whose belated appearance at No. 6 looked set to seal the game. He had eased along to 31 from 67 balls with scarcely a shot in anger, but Swann's first delivery turned sharply into the gloves, and looped tastily to Ian Bell at a commendably attacking short leg. Two balls later Kemar Roach slogged to Chris Tremlett at mid-off, whose extra height proved invaluable in reaching a low chance, and Bopara's subsequent over delivered the decisive run-out. #p#The start of the West Indies innings had been scarcely any less breathtaking. With his abdominal strain still appearing to cause him some discomfort, Gayle decided that boundaries, not singles, were the order of the day. He smashed the usually reliable Tim Bresnan for four fours in his second over of the match, before welcoming Tremlett to World Cup cricket in no-less-devastating fashion, with three fours and a dismissive six over wide long-on. #p#After five overs, West Indies already had 50 on the board, but in a portent of thrills to come, the spinners signalled a change of tempo. Swann's first over went for a tidy three runs, before Tredwell struck with his fourth ball of the tournament, one delivery after Gayle had swatted him for his eighth boundary in 20 balls. Leaning onto the front foot, he was rapped on the pad in front of middle, and a full four years after his maiden England tour, Tredwell finally had his first ODI wicket. #p#One over later, he had his second, when Devon Smith got in a muddle against a yorker, and allowed Matt Prior to pull off a sharp stumping as he scooped the rolling ball in his right glove. And Tredwell made it three wickets in four overs when Darren Bravo was caught in two minds as he pushed outside off, for Strauss at slip to cling onto a sharp low catch. #p#Sammy continued to attack the off-colour Bresnan, who switched ends to no avail, before another big six off Tredwell took him to 36 from 21 balls. However, after a relative period of calm, Bopara nailed him via an inside-edge onto the off stump, and the same mode of dismissal then accounted for Devon Thomas, who had been playing the anchor role in his 10 from 20 balls. Though Kieron Pollard played responsibly for his 27-ball 24, Swann eventually got the better of his block-it-or-slog-it approach, and at 150 for 6, the balance of power had veered towards England once again. #p#It was a scoreline that England themselves would have recognised, for the nadir of their own innings had been 151 for 6, after a calamitous collapse of 4 for 30 in 10.2 overs. All told, it was a batting performance that epitomised England's extraordinary campaign. While Trott was at the crease, caressing boundary after boundary in a 38-ball 47, there seemed no reason to doubt that, at the sixth time of asking, his team would finally produce the command performance that has been so glaringly absent from their efforts to date. But then, when he fell in the 22nd over to a feeble clip to short midwicket, the middle order lost all semblance of direction before Wright's run-a-ball stand of 41 with Tredwell prompted a vital revival. #p#Devendra Bishoo, the Guyanese legspinner, bowled supremely on debut to claim 3 for 34 in his ten overs, including 2 for 23 in a massively composed first spell of eight off the reel, while the bustling Russell was a constant threat as he mixed boundary balls with wicket-taking deliveries to finish with a career-best 4 for 49. But as they face up to yet another head-scratching post-mortem, both sides may wonder how on earth it came to this. With Bangladesh taking on South Africa on Saturday, and West Indies still to face a daunting finale against India, the tussle for qualification is far from over, even if England have taken their own fight as far as it will stretch. #p#Match Timeline
36	506763	England v West Indies, Group B, World Cup 2011, Chennai	Celebrations and uncharacteristic starts	Siddarth Ravindran at the Chidambaram Stadium	March 17, 2011	Andre Russell does his thing after getting rid of Matt Prior Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Matches: England v West Indies at Chennai Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: England | West Indies #p#The celebration - 1 England's openers were getting into top gear, with Andrew Strauss launching the first six of the day in the ninth over. Andre Russell though provided more ammunition to those critical of the decision to open with Matt Prior, by dislodging him for 21 with a length ball that took the inside-edge and cannoned into middle stump. Russell sprinted in jubilation before leaping and clicking his heels, savouring the wicket which came immediately after a loose first over. #p#The uncharacteristic start - Part 1 There have been plenty of questions about the pace of Jonathan Trott's one-day batting, with not everyone convinced that a mid-50s average makes up for a mid-70s strike-rate. There could be no questions about the pace of his batting today, however, as he began with a flurry of effortless boundaries. Six of his first nine deliveries reached the ropes, not one of them muscled or hit in the air, as he sped to 26 off 9 - an unimpeachable strike-rate of 289. #p#The uncharacteristic start - Part 2 Ravi Bopara is rarely more than a sixth-choice bowler. Kieron Pollard is one of the most brutal hitters in the world. Bring them face-to-face, that too in a Powerplay, and you'd expect the ball to be sailing into the crowd frequently. Instead, Pollard watchfully played out eight consecutive deliveries off the part-timer. A maiden to Pollard in the Powerplay? Put that down in your CV, Bopara. #p#The drop Perhaps in return for the respect shown by Pollard to his bowling, Bopara gave the batsman a reprieve in the 25th over. There had been more ups and downs than in a dirt-biking circuit, but the game remained even at that stage with Pollard threatening to be the difference. Two balls after a murderous hit over the official scorers' box, Pollard miscued one towards point; Bopara sprinted from covers and positioned himself under the ball, with his back to the pitch, but couldn't latch on, to the joy of Bangladesh fans everywhere. #p#The where-does-one-bowl over Chris Tremlett was one of three England players making their World Cup debut, and his first over couldn't have been worse. The two deliveries that weren't scored off were a leg-stump ball that Chris Gayle couldn't get past short fine leg and a full toss that wasn't swatted away. In between, Gayle hammered four balls that were short of length for 4, 6, 4 and 4. #p#The pose Russell had enjoyed himself in the morning with four wickets - three of which send stumps cartwheeling - and he continued to have fun with the bat. He announced his batting skills with a baseballer's blast over long-on which made the crowd sit up, but the shot he enjoyed the most was a lofted drive in the next over which flew wide of mid-off and went for four - he admired the stroke and held the follow-through for ages to make sure the cameras got a good shot. #p#The catch? Russell and Ramnaresh Sarwan were wrenching the game West Indies' way with a big stand, when Russell swiped a delivery from Swann towards long-on in the 38th over. Trott back-pedalled towards the rope, and took a catch tumbling backwards, seemingly inches within the rope. He signalled that he hadn't touched the boundary, but the TV umpire was called for. An agonising number of replays couldn't determine whether his floppy hat had brushed the rope, and Russell survived. And to make it worse for England, West Indies got six vital runs as well. #p#The celebration - 2 Trott had a fielding moment to remember soon after though, when Sulieman Benn got the ball towards him at fine leg. He collected and fired in the throw to the keeper, who took off the bails before Benn could make it back for an ill-advised second run. The last wicket was gone, and an ecstatic England team converged towards him to form a delirious huddle. England's thrill-ride in the World Cup continues.
36	506765	ICC World Cup 2011	Bangladesh face uphill task after England win	Madhusudhan Ramakrishnan	March 17, 2011	Bangladesh must beat South Africa to ensure qualification Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Report : England stay alive in another thriller Matches: England v West Indies at Chennai Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup #p#England's tremendous comeback against West Indies gave them an 18-run victory in their must-win encounter in Chennai. With that victory, they have given themselves every chance of qualifying for the quarter-finals. South Africa are the only team from Group B who have ensured qualification and there are a number of possible scenarios that will decide both the teams qualifying and the position of the teams that qualify for the knockouts. #p#Scenario 1: Bangladesh lose to South Africa and India beat West Indies In this case, Bangladesh will be eliminated because of their inferior net run rate. South Africa will finish top of the group with ten points and India will finish second with nine points. England and West Indies will finish third and fourth respectively. #p#Scenario 2: Bangladesh beat South Africa and West Indies beat India England will be hoping this scenario does not happen. If Bangladesh beat South Africa, they will move to eight points and West Indies will also finish on eight if they beat India. With three teams level on points and number of wins, the net run rate will decide the standings. West Indies and South Africa will take the top two spots and Bangladesh the third spot. India will edge out England for the fourth position barring a huge defeat against West Indies. #p#A highly unlikely situation that can result in England's progress at the expense of India is if West Indies make 300 and dismiss India for 117 or if West Indies can dismiss India for 150 and chase the target down in 20.3 overs. #p#Scenario 3: Bangladesh beat South Africa and India beat West Indies This scenario will eliminate West Indies as they will finish on six points as compared to Bangladesh and England, who will have eight and seven points respectively. India will move to the top spot with nine points and South Africa by virtue of a higher net run rate will finish above Bangladesh in second position. #p#Scenario 4: Bangladesh lose to South Africa and India lose to West Indies This scenario will pitchfork West Indies to the second spot, with eight points. South Africa will lead the group with 10, while India and England will both make the cut, with seven points, and their positions will be decided by NRR. With three wins and three losses, Bangladesh's campaign will end on six points. #p#Scenario 5: A washout or a tie in the Bangladesh v South Africa game If points are split in Mirpur, Bangladesh will finish level with England on seven points, but with a poorer NRR. This will confirm England's passage, while Bangladesh's hopes of progressing will rest on India either beating West Indies, or losing by a margin huge enough to bring their NRR crashing down below Bangladesh's. A close West Indian victory in Chennai will, however, end Bangladesh's World Cup. #p#Scenario 6: A washout or a tie in the India v West Indies game This is a scenario England will be hoping against, if Bangladesh manage to upset South Africa in Mirpur. With eight points each, Bangladesh, South Africa and India will then make the cut, while West Indies will pip England for the fourth spot on NRR despite being tied on seven points. If Bangladesh, however, lose in Mirpur, a tie or washout in Chennai will leave India second in the table behind South Africa, while West Indies and England will qualify in third and fourth positions. #p#In the highly-unlikely event that both games are either tied or washed out, India will move up to eight points and second on the table, while England, West Indies and Bangladesh will finish with seven points. With the poorest NRR of the three, Bangladesh will again be the team missing out.
36	506766	World Cup 2011	Shahzad ruled out with hamstring injury	ESPNcricinfo staff	March 17, 2011	Ajmal Shahzad won't be playing in the World Cup quarter-finals if England make it to the knockout stage Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: Ajmal Shahzad | Chris Woakes Matches: England v West Indies at Chennai Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: England #p#With England having kept their World Cup hopes alive after their 18-run victory against West Indies they need to decide on a replacement for Ajmal Shahzad who has been ruled out with a hamstring strain. #p#Shahzad picked up the problem, a recurrence of an injury he suffered in Australia, between playing Bangladesh, where he took 3 for 43, and the West Indies match and missed the final group game in Chennai. A spokesman said Shahzad "will return to the UK for further assessment" but the management were waiting on the West Indies result before considering their options. #p#A defeat would have sent England home and, although they still need results to go their way, it's likely another player will now be flown out. The likeliest replacement is Chris Woakes, the Warwickshire seamer, who made his international debut in Australia and impressed in both the Twenty20s and ODIs. In the first T20 at Adelaide he held his nerve to hit the winning runs then, in the fifth ODI at Brisbane, he took 6 for 49 which are the second best figures by an England bowler in one-dayers. #p#In recent weeks he has been on the Lions tour of West Indies playing the regional four-day tournament and took a hat-trick against Guyana at Providence. Another option could be Adil Rashid, the Yorkshire legspinner, but with James Tredwell having come into the side with 4 for 48 against West Indies England will probably feel their spin options are covered. #p#Shahzad becomes the third England player to be sent home from the World Cup following Kevin Pietersen (hernia) and Stuart Broad (side) back to the UK. Eoin Morgan was initially ruled out of the tournament, but then replaced Pietersen having recovered from his broken finger.
36	506774	England v West Indies, Group B, World Cup 2011, Chennai	Unknowns announce arrival on grand stage	Siddarth Ravindran at the Chidambaram Stadium	March 17, 2011	James Tredwell took four wickets on his World Cup debut in a crunch game Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: Devendra Bishoo | Ravi Bopara | Andre Russell | James Tredwell | Luke Wright Matches: England v West Indies at Chennai Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: England | West Indies #p#In a sink-or-swim match between two Test teams in cricket's biggest tournament, you'd expect the seasoned players and the marquee names to be imposing themselves on such a grand stage. But at the MA Chidambaram Stadium it was the no-namers who made the biggest impact as England continued their Hitchcockian progress through the World Cup with yet another nerve-shredder against West Indies. #p#James Tredwell, Devendra Bishoo and Andre Russell are names that might puzzle even committed cricket fans, though they turned out to be among the players who set up a memorably tense match. The surprises started even before the action did, when XIs were announced and both sides made big calls - England dropped their only experienced fast bowler James Anderson and their leading one-day run-scorer Paul Collingwood while West Indies dropped their most experienced batsman, Shivnarine Chanderpaul. #p#Once England chose to bat, it was assumed the red-hot pace of Kemar Roach and the spin of Sulieman Benn would be the big threats. Instead, it was Russell, a 22-year-old with only about a dozen List A matches for his home side Jamaica under his belt, who removed the England openers, following it up with exuberant Brett Lee-style celebrations. It wasn't frighteningly quick bowling from Russell, and he frequently pitched it too short, though he got several deliveries to hold their line, which was enough to get through the batsmen's defences three times and leave the stumps on the ground. #p#Taking the baton from Russell was the legspinner Bishoo. The purveyor of a difficult art, his task was even tougher as it was his first game in international cricket, his first game in the subcontinent, in front of a 10,000-strong crowd, and he was up against Jonathan Trott in full flow and Ian Bell. He kept his cool, and his line and lengths, and the absence of bad balls meant he didn't cede a boundary till the ninth over. #p#His control prompted the normally circumspect Trott to play against the turn, giving a catch to midwicket three short of his fifth half-century of the tournament. The prized wicket of Eoin Morgan followed, and Bishoo ended up with 3 for 34, the joint-best figures for a debutant West Indian spinner. #p#Bishoo and Russell had left England pondering an early flight home, before the fightback was spearheaded by another unlikely source. Luke Wright's batting average of 22 and bowling average of 56 has been a source of mirth for England fans, though he earned a measure of respect with an enterprising 44 that kept his team in the high-stakes contest. Half-an-hour of mayhem from Chris Gayle though left them scouring the travel websites again. #p#Andre Russell almost took West Indies home with his belligerent 49 Getty Images Enlarge #p#England are among the most analysed team in cricket, with a large press pack looking into the team's every move. It's unlikely, though, that any of them could have foretold that the team's World Cup hopes would be kept alive by the unspectacular bowling of Tredwell and the dibbly-dobblies of Ravi Bopara. #p#Faced with a rampaging Gayle in the Powerplay, with the knowledge that he had a total of zero wickets in his one-day career, and with nearly two months of turning up for England training sessions with getting a game, Tredwell was given the ball in the seventh over. A slog sweep for four made one fear the worst, but he remained unflappable, nipping out three wickets in four overs, including the big ones of Gayle and Darren Bravo, that re-infused belief in the England fans scattered around the stadium. #p#It was Bopara's turn then to take the centrestage, after the specialist quicks were hammered for more than ten an over. Ten wickets in 57 matches is hardly the stuff of champions, though Bopara's medium-pace kept England in the game by ending Darren Sammy's hard-hitting cameo. He even bowled a maiden to Kieron Pollard in a smartly delayed bowling Powerplay. #p#When Pollard perished after mowing a six into the drinks trolley and then powering one to the top of the sightscreen, West Indies looked to the experience of Ramnaresh Sarwan to pull them through. Yet again, though, it was a little-known who spiced up the contest, with Russell showing signs of adding to West Indies' burgeoning pack of medium-pace allrounders. He utterly dominated a 72-run stand with Sarwan, pulling off some flamboyant sixes and remaining unperturbed in the unnervingly tight finale. #p#Russell had taken West Indies to within 22 of victory before the journeyman Tredwell returned to end his stay, and his Man-of-the-Match chances, as West Indies lost their remaining three wickets for three runs in a spine-tingling finish. #p#Strauss acknowledged the difficulty of coming in from the cold for a big match. "It's so tough when you are sitting there on the outside, looking on all the time," he said. "Doing the net practice, waiting for your turn, and a lot time thinking your turn wouldn't come." #p#Both teams gambled by going with fringe players instead of established ones, and it paid off as the understudies played starring roles in a cracker that extended the suspense in Group B to the final league match.
36	506775	England v West Indies, Group B, World Cup 2011, Chennai	The life of the party lives another day	Sambit Bal in Chennai	March 17, 2011	It was a game for the outsiders, with Ravi Bopara's medium pace proving crucial to the cause Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: Devendra Bishoo | Ravi Bopara | Andre Russell | James Tredwell | Luke Wright Matches: England v West Indies at Chennai Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: England | West Indies #p#England are still alive in the World Cup, and just as well. Schizophrenic and never short of thrills, they have been the life of this tournament. Fittingly, they produced another flawed performance, yet inspirational and resilient, to ensure that they won't be boarding the flight home tomorrow morning. They have spent an eternity on the road so far this winter, but not having them at the business end of the tournament would just not be right. The World Cup needs them nearly as much as they need it. #p#If anything, England have displayed a near-miraculous ability to calibrate their game to the relative strengths of their opponents. But today they found an opponent more truant than them, and just as England had blown their previous match as much as Bangladesh had won it, today the West Indians lost it as much as England snatched it from them. #p#Ottis Gibson, the West Indies coach, and a vital member of the English troupe not so long ago, spoke almost enviously about the resilience in the opposition camp which kept them in the quarter-final reckoning. The 18-run margin may look huge in a relatively low-scoring game, but on the field, it was almost as tight as Jonathan's Trott's disputed catch on the long-on boundary - a massive moment which was, after inconclusive replays, called a six. #p#That was the sort of moment that could have crushed England. West Indies were less than 40 runs away from their target with Ramnaresh Sarwan and Andre Russell, playing only in his second ODI and batting like a braveheart, having added 54 for the seventh wicket. Russell's dismissal would have left them 204 for 7 with no more batting to follow. Instead they jumped to 210 for 6. With a catch having gone down in the outfield earlier, England would have been excused for imagining divine injustice. #p#But instead they regrouped. The field closed in. One more man was brought in to the circle. James Tredwell, a county veteran but World Cup rookie, who had kept England in the game with three wickets in his first four overs, replaced Graeme Swann and produced a tight over that yielded only a run. Ravi Bopara then chugged through another tidy over that was only ruined by a fortuitous squeeze from Sarwan that ran away to third man for four. But clearly the incident of that catch seemed to have unnerved the West Indians more than the English. #p#Till then, the West Indian batsmen had played boldly and adventurously; more adventurously perhaps than the occasion demanded. It looked fitful and desperate, but it was working. Nine sixes had been clouted, and Russell alone had hit three, each a clean blow over the straight field. But suddenly, with the knowledge that victory, now in their grasp, could have slipped with that catch on the boundary, they grew fidgety and edgy. And England had the men to prey on their nerves. #p#With four balls remaining in his tenth over, Tredwell went round the wicket to pin Russell on the crease. And back for his final over, Swann got a ball kick up to Sarwan and a forward short-leg had been posted to accept the inside-edge. Sulieman Benn survived a close lbw, but Kemar Roach went to a feeble loft to mid-off, and finally, Benn charged down for a desperate second to be run out by a yard. #p#By then England had already recovered from a middle-order collapse of 4 for 40 to post a score that could be defended, before weathering an early blitz from Chris Gayle, who clubbed the quick bowlers so ferociously that England, who opened with Swann, had spin at both ends by the seventh over. #p#But the moves that would prove decisive were made before the toss. In some ways, England's hands were forced by circumstance, having lost first Stuart Broad and then Ajmal Shahzad to injury. But instead of trusting the experience of James Anderson and Paul Collingwood England plumped for Tredwell and Luke Wright. It was a gamble because as Andrew Strauss admitted, as composed on the field as he is before the cameras, the new players may have come in mentally fresh, but they also did so without match practice, and in Tredwell's case, not a single wicket at ODI level. #p#But as was the case with Devendra Bishoo, the little Guyanese legspinner whom West Indies chose to blood, this was a match for the outsiders. Wright, who has spent most of his time in this World Cup as a substitute fielder, played perhaps the most important role of his stop-start international career to save the English innings from imploding. The West Indians made it easier for him by switching to their lesser bowlers when England were under the cosh, and by dropping their intensity on the field, but Wright batted intelligently, building gradually and then taking boundaries when opportunities came to swing his arms. #p#England haven't been the best team in the World Cup. In fact, a theoretical chance still exists - if Bangladesh beat South Africa and West Indies bounce back to beat India - that they could still be eliminated before the quarter-finals. But unlike some of the more fancied teams in this tournament, they are yet to lose to a top side, and with Bangladesh and Ireland out of their way, who knows how far they can go. #p#But for the moment, let's be grateful that they are still there, keeping the World Cup throbbing and turning. Are they really the new Pakistan, as Swann suggested immediately after the win? Who would have ever said that about an English side?

At 151 for 6, England's tail was exposed but West Indies didn't bring on their spearhead, Kemar Roach, and instead chose to use the less menacing Sulieman Benn and Kieron Pollard, which allowed Luke Wright to lead a revival. #p#During the chase, they had England on the mat, first after the all-out-attack from Chris Gayle and Darren Sammy, and later when the Andre Russell -Ramnaresh Sarwan stand took them close, but on both occasions a clutch of wickets undermined their chances of victory. West Indies coach Ottis Gibson wants his side to grasp some of England's scrapping ability, which he feels will be vital for Caribbean cricket to rise again. #p#"England have been a resilient side for a long time, they don't always play their best game, but somebody stands up, today it was Tredwell, Luke Wright's been waiting for a game a while as well, he had a good game with the bat," Gibson said after the game. "They have got the resilience that we are looking for." #p#West Indies came out chasing 243 as though it was 343, with Gayle initially setting a scorching pace before Sammy blasted three sixes to keep the run-rate at seven an over. It was a bizarre scorecard, with the top six batsmen either going berzerk at close to two runs a ball, or dropping anchor at a strike-rate of 45 or less - as though only first gear and top gear existed. #p#Gibson said the power-hitting from Gayle and Sammy was part of their strategy. "The hardness of the ball made it easier for stroke-play, as the ball got softer it became a lot harder to bat," he said. "We knew the ball would stay a little bit in the pitch and that it would turn a lot more when it was softer, so the strategy was to capitalise on the early overs which we did. We were always at five an over (required rate). What we needed was somebody to see us through, and that didn't happen." #p#While using Sammy as a pinch-hitter was a planned move, pushing the wicketkeeper Devon Thomas to No. 4 was less so. "A toilet break," Gibson revealed as the reason behind the change. "Sarwan couldn't make it to the crease in time, that's why Thomas came." #p#Despite the defeat, Gibson said that the performance of the two newcomers, allrounder Russell and legspinner Devendra Bishoo , gave him cause for optimism. Russell picked up four wickets before his quickfire 49 took West Indies close to the finish line. "Great performance from Andre Russell today in only his second international game," he said, "bowling very well and then making a good 49, putting on a good partnership with Sarwan." #p#Bishoo impressed on debut, with three wickets including those of Jonathan Trott and Eoin Morgan. "You saw the emergence of young Devendra Bishoo, another little gem we have known about for a while, who came here and did a great job with his legspinners," Gibson said. "Roach, Russell, Dwayne Bravo, all those guys are under 25, they are going to be the nucleus of the West Indies team for a long time to come. As a coach, there is a hell of a lot to take out of this [defeat] and move forward with." #p#The defeat in Chennai means West Indies could face a must-win tie against India on Sunday, if Bangladesh manage to upset South Africa on Saturday. A Bangladesh defeat will almost certainly send West Indies into the quarter-finals, irrespective of the outcome against India. "We haven't beaten a top team in some 20 months," said Gibson. "We would like to do that [on Sunday], we had another opportunity today, we didn't take it but we are getting closer."

Ireland have done the most to justify the Associates' presence this tournament, consistently challenging top sides with the exception of South Africa. They've been the best of the four qualifiers for this World Cup, the best-placed among that group to feature more regularly against the elite teams, and they would want to reinforce that with a clinical performance against Netherlands on Friday in what will be both teams' last World Cup game. #p#The Netherlands captain Peter Borren has repeatedly stressed the need for Associate teams to play the top sides more often, not just in World Cups. Since pushing England close, Netherlands have declined steadily, their captain admitting they haven't met their own standards. A winless World Cup would be deflating at the least, and it's a harsh result for a team that would perhaps feel it is in the wrong group, given how the other two Associates have performed this tournament. A win, however, against an opponent who've won the respect of the cricketing world would restore some pride in a team that has, by its own admission, underperformed. #p#Form guide (completed matches, most recent first) #p#Netherlands : LLLLL Ireland : LLLWL #p#Watch out for... #p#Wesley Barresi : He's got starts in four of his five this World Cup but has then got bogged down, undermining his healthy strike-rate of 74. He was pushed from the middle order to open this World Cup but hasn't delivered the starts that the promotion was meant to bring about. A familiar opposition in Ireland should prompt him to show lesser restraint. #p#Kevin O'Brien : His stunning century against England will be hard to replicate but O'Brien has since stumbled in his performances with the bat. He was dismissed cheaply against India and threw his wicket at a crucial juncture in what was building up to be a close chase against West Indies. Moreover, he's had trouble against Netherlands. In seven games against them, he averages just 17.40 with a highest of 34. What better stage to make amends than the World Cup. #p#Team news #p#Ireland (possible): 1 William Porterfield (capt), 2 Paul Stirling, 3 Ed Joyce, 4 Niall O'Brien (wk), 5 Gary Wilson, 6 Kevin O'Brien, 7 Alex Cusack, 8 John Mooney, 9 Trent Johnston, 10 George Dockrell, 11 Boyd Rankin. #p#Netherlands (possible): 1 Eric Swarczynski, 2 Wesley Baressi (wk), 3 Tom Cooper, 4 Ryan ten Doeschate, 5 Alexei Kerveezee, 6 Bas Zuiderent, 7 Tom de Grooth, 8 Mudassar Bukhari, 9 Peter Borren, 10 Pieter Seelaar, 11 Adeel Raja. #p#Try picking the XIs for tomorrow's game by playing Team Selector. #p#Stats and trivia #p#Ireland have an excellent record against Netherlands in ODIs, winning five out of seven.

37	506738	Ireland v Netherlands, Group B, World Cup 2011, Kolkata	Ireland ready for the big guys - Simmons	ESPNcricinfo staff	March 17, 2011	'Ireland are ready to take on the big guys' Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Preview : Associates play for pride before exit Players/Officials: Peter Borren | William Porterfield | Phil Simmons Matches: Ireland v Netherlands at Kolkata Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Ireland #p#Ireland ought to play more often against the bigger teams because they've won their respect given how they've performed in this World Cup, coach Phil Simmons has said. Ireland failed to qualify for the quarter-finals, but beat England and challenged Bangladesh, India and West Indies in the run-up to their final game of the tournament, against Netherlands on Friday in Kolkata. #p#"We need to play more games against big guys because they all have respect for us now," Simmons said. "We can play against big guys. We now no longer play to compete only, but to win. I think the biggest improvement is that we come looking to win the game (against bigger sides) and planning how to win the game." #p#The disappointing feature of Ireland's performance, Simmons said, was the fact that they didn't finish off matches despite pushing some of the top teams close. Though they overcame England in a thrilling finish, they lost narrowly to Bangladesh in Mirpur and faltered in what was shaping up to be a fighting chase against West Indies. More experience of playing against the bigger teams was the key to improvement, according to Simmons. #p#"It's disappointing that we put ourselves in a position to win, but could not follow up. I think it shows that we need more games at this level to get us ready against big guys." Simmons admitted his team still had a long way to go to achieve Test status, but deserved to compete more often in the limited-overs formats. "We have been asking the ICC that we need more games. We are nowhere near Tests, but we sure can play one-day internationals and Twenty20 matches." #p#Ireland captain William Porterfield said the team's batsmen need to step up. "In some of the games we put ourselves into winning positions. It would have been wonderful if we had a couple of wins under our belts," he said. "We need to improve on a couple of areas in our batting. We have lost wickets in clusters in some of the matches, something we can't afford to do against big teams." #p#Porterfield's Netherlands counterpart, Peter Borren, said the game was significant as his team is yet to register a win in the competition. "Motivation is not difficult for us because we obviously have not had a win and hope to end on a high note," he said. "Ireland has done well in the tournament and has been competitive, but if we go out there and win tomorrow, we will be making a statement."
37	506783	Ireland v Netherlands, World Cup 2011, Group B, Kolkata	Stirling ton sets up six-wicket win	The Bulletin by Liam Brickhill	March 18, 2011	#p#Ireland 307 for 4 (Stirling 101, Porterfield 68, Cooper 2-31) beat Netherlands 306 (ten Doeschate 106, Borren 84, Stirling 2-51) by six wickets Live scorecard and ball-by-ball details #p#Paul Stirling blitzes one to the boundary during his match-winning hundred Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: Peter Borren | Paul Stirling | Ryan ten Doeschate Matches: Ireland v Netherlands at Kolkata Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Ireland | Netherlands #p#Two sparkling centuries lit up Ireland's clash with Netherlands at Eden Gardens in Kolkata, Ryan ten Doeschate propping Netherlands up with his second ton of the tournament and Paul Stirling then launching Ireland's pursuit of 306 with a blazing, 72-ball 101. Ireland's disciplined bowling and far superior fielding proved the difference between the two sides, and they eventually triumphed by six wickets with more than two overs to spare after a far closer finish had appeared possible. #p#Apart from one lapse in the first over, Ireland had barely fumbled while restricting Netherlands on a benign, batting-friendly surface and closed out the innings in bizarre circumstances with four run-outs in four balls. Netherlands were nowhere near as tight in comparison, putting down three clear chances and failing to keep the pressure on in the field, their lapses repeatedly allowing Ireland to stay ahead of the game. #p#Netherlands should have had a breakthrough as early as the third over, but Adeel Raja put down a top edge off William Porterfield's bat at third man and Ireland were soon rocketing along at eight an over. Stirling provided the main impetus in that regard, swinging from the hip from the very start of his knock, as the first ball he faced was answered with a wild hook and a top edge that sailed straight over the wicketkeeper for six. He barely slowed down thereafter, hitting very little straight down the ground but repeatedly puncturing the field on both sides of the wicket. #p#He plundered 19 from Bernard Loots' second over, including a second six over deep midwicket, and shortly after brought up a 25-ball half century, the second fastest in the tournament. Porterfield was rather more circumspect but had no problems putting the bad ball away, and after 68 out of 81 runs came in boundaries in the first 10 overs Netherlands were forced to postpone their use of the bowling Powerplay simply to try and slow Ireland down. #p#With Pieter Seelaar and ten Doeschate, Netherlands' two most accomplished bowlers, operating in tandem, the tactic temporarily worked but when the bowling Powerplay was eventually taken in the 19th over, and the batsmen attempted to pick up the tempo once again, Netherlands put down two chances in as many overs to lose further ground. #p#Porterfield eased past fifty in the 20th over but by then Stirling already had a hundred in his sights. Their partnership stretched to 177, a new Irish record for the opening stand in ODIs, before, in a three-ball flurry of excitement, Porterfield fell to a catch behind and Stirling brought up his century but then thumped the next ball - a long-hop - straight to the fielder on the deep-midwicket boundary. Their departures opened a window of opportunity for Netherlands but Ireland's chase barely missed a step, with each successive batsman making a contribution and the brothers O'Brien closing out the game with an unbroken 28-run partnership at close to nine an over. #p#While lacklustre bowling and fielding let Netherlands down, the ascendancy had swung between the two teams before lunch and Netherlands had gained in an attacking stand between ten Doeschate and captain Peter Borren. The Ireland bowlers had few answers against the pair and were hampered by an injury to young left-arm spinner George Dockrell, who appeared to dislocate his shoulder as he dived to stop the ball and had to immediately leave the field. #p#Smart Stats The target of 307 is the second-highest successfully chased score in ODIs in Kolkata. The highest is 316 by India against Sri Lanka in 2009. Ryan ten Doeschate's century is his second of the tournament and he becomes the third player after AB de Villiers and Sachin Tendulkar to score two centuries in the 2011 World Cup. ten Doeschate has now scored five centuries and nine fifties in ODIs. Among batsmen who have scored over 1500 runs in ODIs, his average of 67.00 is the highest. The 121-run stand between ten Doeschate and Peter Borren is the highest for the fifth wicket for Netherlands in ODIs. Paul Stirling scored a century off just 70 balls, which is the fourth fastest in World Cups and the second fastest for an Irish batsman in World Cups. Stirling's strike rate of 140.27 is the second highest for an Irish batsman for a score over 100 in ODIs The 177-run stand between William Porterfield and Stirling is the third-highest opening-wicket partnership in the 2011 World Cup and the highest for Ireland in ODIs. The 81 runs scored by Ireland in the mandatory Powerplay is their highest score in the first ten overs of an innings in the tournament. #p#In his absence, ten Doeschate and Borren added 121 for the fifth wicket, by far the largest stand of the innings, in quick time on a pitch that looked increasingly good for batting after the early-morning moisture had been scorched from the surface. ten Doeschate had also been involved in two other important partnerships after Netherlands lost two early wickets and then suffered a further casualty when Wesley Barresi was forced to leave the field in just the second over after being hit on the back of the head by a return throw from Kevin O'Brien. #p#ten Doeschate kick-started his innings by adding 41 with Alexei Kervezee, who struggled to deal with the early bounce and movement and eventually gave his wicket away softly, pushing a length delivery from John Mooney straight into the hands of Kevin O'Brien. That dismissal brought Barresi back to the crease, and he immediately set about the Irish bowling. He raced into the 40s before he was pinned in front of his stumps, but Dockrell's injury noticeably dampened Ireland's mood and ten Doeschate and Borren quickly seized the initiative once again. #p#ten Doeschate raised his fifty in the 27th over and with the field set back in defence, the partnership developed with plenty of running between the wickets before he opened up as he closed in on a century. Borren raced to a 56-ball half-century in the 38th over and ten Doeschate went to his own landmark soon after in the midst of another expensive over from Boyd Rankin. He celebrated by heaving Stirling over wide long-on but fell trying to repeat the shot next ball, caught at long-off by Mooney. #p#Borren and wicketkeeper Atse Buurman didn't allow the pitch to slow Netherlands' momentum and continued to find the boundary - though more than once it was courtesy of outside edges and slashes past third man but the innings ended in farcical circumstances when Netherlands lost four wickets in four balls - all run out - to be bowled out for 306. That still might have been a match-winning total, but ultimately Ireland showed the value of their greater professionalism and the enhanced self-belief that has come from their positive performances in this tournament. #p#Match Timeline

He is due to play for Somerset in the upcoming English county season after signing for them last year. #p#"He [Dockrell] has dislocated his [right] shoulder and will probably be out for the standard four to six weeks," Ireland captain William Porterfield said after his team's six-wicket victory. "It's not great timing as he was due to start pre-season training with Somerset, so it is a setback for him and hopefully he gets over it quickly." #p#Dockrell picked up the injury while trying to field off his own bowling in his fourth over and, in his absence, Ireland conceded 306 in their final match of the tournament.

37	506926	Ireland v Netherlands, World Cup 2011, Group B, Kolkata	Porterfield proud of Ireland's show	ESPNcricinfo staff	March 18, 2011	#p#William Porterfield reflected proudly on Ireland's World Cup campaign after they complete their stay in the tournament with a six-wicket victory against Netherlands. Paul Stirling led an impressive run chase with 101 off 72 balls, adding 177 for the first wicket with Porterfield, which enabled Ireland to hunt down 307 with 14 deliveries to spare. #p#It was the second time they had chased down more than 300 to win following the famous pursuit against England, in Bangalore, when they reached 329. Two victories was a fair return for Ireland, whose reputation has been further enhanced, but it could have been even better after they wasted a golden chance against Bangladesh and also competed against West Indies. #p#"We have turned up for every game. We were consistent with the ball and on the field stands but haven't backed it up with the bat consistently what we did today," Porterfield said."But when you put yourselves into winning positions you will win more than you lose. It was great to chase 300 for the second time in the tournament. #p#"Anytime we got behind the run rate we just picked up. We played good cricket in the second half of the game. So I am very pleased." #p#Porterfield was happy to play second fiddle to Stirling as he dispatched the Netherlands bowlers around Eden Gardens, but was less pleased with Ireland's display in the field. "It took a lot of pressure of me," he said. "I was happy to play the second fiddle and watch someone smash it around and get a century off 70 balls. #p#Ireland have an impressive account of themselves during the World Cup AFP Enlarge #p#"But we should not have been chasing that [many]. We let ourselves down in the first half. But we have bowled and fielded well throughout the tournament and it was nice to see the batters coming to the party today." #p#Ireland's competitive showing at the tournament came at an opportune moment with Associates still waiting to find out whether they'll have a chance to appear in the 2015 World Cup when it is trimmed to ten teams. #p#Although Netherlands finished winless they didn't disgrace themselves and pushed England close during their opening game with Ryan ten Doeschate hitting a fine hundred. He followed that with 106 against Ireland, but Netherlands' bowling has been their weakness and couldn't contain the Ireland top order. #p#"We batted pretty well to get more than 300 and I think our total was quite defendable," Peter Borren, the captain, said. "We did not show discipline in bowling and dropped some catches, so we are pretty disappointed. We probably should have won the game. Fielding has been an area of concern for us in the last couple of years. Ireland saved 20-25 runs with their fielding and we did just the opposite, giving away runs that we could have saved."

The match itself doesn't quite promise to be as hot as the matches between big teams in the Group B: New Zealand are going easy, not risking either Daniel Vettori or Kyle Mills; Sri Lanka, the pre-tournament favourites, are yet to put up a performance to match that billing. #p#That said, there is a lot at stake. Not only is this the last league game for both teams, which makes this important for momentum purposes, more importantly the winners here will be assured a place in the top two, which means they will get one of the two bottom teams from Group B in the quarters. Then again, looking at how chaotic Group B has been, that might eventually not count for much: one of the bottom sides there still could be India, and one of the top ones Bangladesh. #p#Neither New Zealand nor Sri Lanka will be thinking of Group B, though. To finish in the top two, and to give themselves an even chance to win the quarterfinal, will be some progress for New Zealand, who were blanked 4-0 and 5-0 in their last two series in the subcontinent. For Sri Lanka, this is an opportunity to announce themselves in this World Cup. They have been efficient against the minnows, but they lost to Pakistan, and had only fought back to make things even before rain ended their game against Australia. #p#Form guide (completed matches, most recent first) New Zealand WWWLW Sri Lanka WWLWW #p#Watch out for... #p#This will be a near homecoming for Lasith Malinga , who - when playing for Mumbai Indians - got the whole Wankhede Stadium to chant "Ma-lin-ga, Ma-lin-ga" when bowling yorkers and slower balls from hell.

38	506734	New Zealand v Sri Lanka, World Cup 2011, Mumbai	Nathan McCullum steps into Vettori's shoes	Nagraj Gollapudi in Mumbai	March 17, 2011	Nathan McCullum will have to wear the premier spinner's hat against Sri Lanka Associated Press Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: Nathan McCullum Matches: New Zealand v Sri Lanka at Mumbai Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: New Zealand #p#Nathan McCullum does not bowl a doosra. He says he is working on an unfinished delivery, for which he does not have a name yet. McCullum, however, is certain about his role in this New Zealand side: to defend at all costs. On Friday he will face his biggest challenge against the Sri Lankan batsmen, who read hands better than master palmists. In the absence of Daniel Vettori for the second consecutive match, McCullum has to be New Zealand's frontline spinner. #p#McCullum's build-up so far in this World Cup has been patchy. Not once has he delivered a full quota of 10 overs, bring used primarily as a utility bowler rather than a strike option. He has taken only three wickets in five matches at an average of 45, which is better than his career mean of 50. All his wickets have come towards the end of the innings, after the mandatory ball change, and he has failed to ask questions of opposition batsmen. Even spinners from weaker teams - Ray Price of Zimbabwe (seven wickets at 21 each), George Dockerell of Ireland (seven at 27) and Peeter Seelar of Netherlands (seven at 35) - have made stronger impressions than has McCullum. #p#Yet, McCullum could play Sri Lanka with added confidence. He had a brief chat with Sunil Fernando, Muttiah Muralitharan's coach, who dropped in during New Zealand's training session ahead of the Pakistan match at John Wright's request. Though the chat lasted barely a few minutes, McCullum was reinvigorated. He realised his thought process about working towards a wicket was similar to what Fernando had in mind. There was not much time to talk technique, but McCullum is bound to utilise the knowledge against Sri Lankans. #p#"I guess it depends on what type of spinner you are and how you work in the team. They perform different roles depending on the type of spinner," McCullum said of the role of a spinner in modern-day cricket. "As for my role, it is to work hard and try and go for 40-45 off my ten overs, and if I pick up one or two wickets that will do." #p#McCullum felt his job was no different to that of a Muralitharan, the difference being Murali is a strike bowler. "In the Sri Lankan side, Muralitharan is looked at as a big wicket-taker, but at the end of the day even he has to go for 40-45 runs while he picks up the wickets." McCullum is not cocky about his strengths. He is modest in fact, and would like to one day pick the brains of Murali and Harbhajan Singh to understand how they do what they do. In the interim he could change his mindset and become a wicket-taker instead of being tamed by batsmen. #p#In the only World Cup match played at the Wankhede so far, New Zealand's bowlers had to toil to get wickets against Canada, who lost by 97 runs but lasted 50 overs. It was the first time New Zealand had to bowl their complete quota of overs. It was also the only occasion McCullum came close to bowling 10 overs - he finished with 56 for 1 off eight. #p#On Wednesday, Ross Taylor said the absence of Vettori and Kyle Mills would not hurt them because New Zealand had enough men of character to step up. McCullum can be one of them. The pitch has enough bounce and turn, New Zealand have a good fielding side. He needs to bowl with the positive attitude with which he bats. McCullum is one of the best finishers in the game. He has as strike-rate of 120 while batting in the final 10 overs; 52% of his runs are in boundaries. He needs to be that aggressive while bowling. #p#"I don't think my role changes at all. It just means I got to little bit more consistent and more aware of performing my role to the full extent," he said. "When you lose a big player like Daniel Vettori and Kyle Milles every one needs to stand up and perform their role to the full extent."

Chasing a challenging total of 277, Sri Lanka got off to a good start with Tillakaratne Dilshan and Upul Tharanga adding 76, but the hosts lost control immediately as four wickets fell for just 20 runs in seven overs. Sri Lanka have just one match left to repair those mistakes before the quarterfinals. #p#"When the time comes, the guys will step up," Sangakkara said, shrugging off the idea that the middle order had some work to do. "We had probably one bad game against Pakistan. We looked pretty solid against Australia and the other games, the middle order didn't have much to do. So the real test will come and the guys are very capable of stepping up in those games for us." #p#The fact that batsmen in the lower middle order - Mathews, Perera, Silva - have not spent enough time in the middle is not causing any distress for Sangakkara. "If we can win matches with just the top order, I think that is good enough for us. But if the middle order needs to come in, that's why they are selected because they're good enough to do the job. Failures do happen. So that's the way cricket goes. You take those opportunities and do as much as you can. If you cannot be successful, you try and learn and get better." #p#Sangakkara said it was important the Sri Lanka don't lose the focus going into the knockouts. "You know, when you play in a World Cup, past doesn't really matter and it's exactly what you do when the game comes. For us, it's going back to the basics and probably we cover all our bases and take the opportunity." #p#Many captains, including Ross Taylor, Sangakkara's counterpart for tomorrow's game, have stressed that a victory in the final group clash would provide the momentum going into the quarterfinals. Sangakkara differs. "Every side likes to build momentum and take it into the really important stages. At the same time sides also might not win in the final first-round game and won't be too much worried about it. The quarters, semis and the finals are the one that really count. Therefore, what happens just before does not really matter, unless it takes psychological toll on that particular side."

Kumar Sangakkara made his first ODI century since June 2008, supported by a controversial 66 from Mahela Jayawardene , to haul Sri Lanka up to 265 before Muttiah Muralitharan spun New Zealand to defeat with 4 for 25. #p#Coming into the tournament as one of the favourites, Sri Lanka have not quite convinced so far and but for their three most experienced players might have struggled again. Instead the finish was the kind of one-sided result that has epitomised Group A. #p#New Zealand, though, will rue their misfortune when Jayawardene was reprieved at a critical moment. Sri Lanka had lost both openers and were struggling to get on top of the New Zealand slow bowlers when, in the 24th over, Jayawardene chipped a return catch to Nathan McCullum. #p#It went low to McCullum's right and the bowler dived full-length to scoop the ball centimetres off the turf. The batsman stood his ground and the decision was sent upstairs. Side-on replays seemed to clearly show McCullum's fingers under the ball but a front-on shot, as it so often does, created doubt that the third umpire, Amiesh Saheba, ruled on. Before then Jayawardene had scrambled for 50 deliveries to make 26 but silkily added a further 40 at a run a ball and Sri Lanka never looked back. #p#Sangakkara helped himself to a century that he's been waiting 64 matches for. Looking typically unhurried, he was content to work the ball around early on before unfurling some of the stylish strokes that are his hallmark as the innings went on. One six, eased down the ground off Scott Styris, told of a batsman in total #p#Smart stats The 145-run partnership between Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene is the second-highest for Sri Lanka against New Zealand in a World Cup match. Sangakkara and Jayawardene have put together 4724 partnership runs in ODIs, which is the highest by a non-opening pair. This was also their tenth century partnership in ODIs, which puts them in second place, next only to the Sachin Tendulkar-Rahul Dravid pair, who have 11. In World Cups, this was their third century partnership in ten innings, but the first against a Test-playing team. Only three other non-opening pairs have got three hundred stands in World Cups. The 112-run margin of victory is Sri Lanka's third-highest against New Zealand. Muttiah Muralitharan's bowling returns of 4 for 25 is his second-best in World Cups, next only to his 4 for 19 against Ireland in 2007. New Zealand's total of 153 is their fourth-lowest in a World Cup match, and their poorest against Sri Lanka. control. The verbal exchanges that Jayawardene got involved with after his escape only served to fire him up and he was soon exhibiting the fluent form that had deserted him since his century against Canada in Sri Lanka's opening game. #p#The pair added 145 and the importance of the stand was demonstrated by what followed. Sangakkara rushed to his century with four boundaries in six deliveries but was out soon after for 111. Following his dismissal Sri Lanka lost five wickets for 55 in the final 8.2 overs. That they even got so many was almost entirely down to Angelo Mathews, who swatted 41 from 35 balls to thwart New Zealand's fightback. #p#In the end, the collapse was irrelevant but in the knockout stages, opposition teams will know beneath Sri Lanka's top order is a soft underbelly waiting to be exposed. New Zealand would have backed themselves to make a better fist of chasing but - despite dew, on a ground that will host the World Cup final, hampering the Sri Lanka spinners - Muralitharan and Mendis choked them into submission. #p#The early work was done by the quicks when Brendon McCullum was given out by the TV umpire after Jayawardene, of all people, claimed a low catch off Mathews. There was some uncertainty as the take was almost spilled at the last moment. TV replays were not entirely certain but, unlike the first time, the right decision was made and McCullum was sent on his was for 14. After Guptill fell for 13, Jesse Ryder and Ross Taylor threatened to make a match of it but the spinners took over. #p#Mendis' mystery may have faded with exposure but his variations proved too much for Ryder who nibbed a carrom-ball behind for a 23-ball 19. Muralitharan's introduction had been delayed after he picked up an injury while batting. Despite hobbling around, he was still devastating when he finally got into the attack in the 18th over. #p#A doosra took care of Kane Williamson for 5 before he landed the killer blow by spinning one back into Taylor's pads. Despite a big stride and a review, Taylor was rightly given out for 33 and his team never looked like competing. Scott Styris chipped a return catch to Muralitharan, who belied his injury to spring up and snaffle the chance, and Nathan McCullum and James Franklin soon followed. Between them Mendis and Muralitharan took six wickets for 49 in 14 overs. #p#Unlike the frenzied excitement in Group B, the qualifiers in Group A are already settled. Sri Lanka are guaranteed to finish second whatever happens between Australia and Pakistan, which might well leave them in line for a contest against the World Cup mysterybox, England, in the quarter finals. #p#Match Timeline
38	506935	New Zealand v Sri Lanka, Group A, World Cup 2011, Mumbai	Not a lucky day for Tharanga or Malinga	Nagraj Gollapudi at the Wankhede Stadium	March 18, 2011	Nuwan Kulasekara walks back sheepishly after knocking a catch over the boundary for six Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Matches: New Zealand v Sri Lanka at Mumbai Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: New Zealand | Sri Lanka #p#Non-starter of the day There are many awkward ways of getting out, but nothing is more frustrating for a batsman than to get run out after the bowler deflects a straight drive onto the stumps. Tillkaratne Dilshan punched a half-volley from Tim Southee straight back. The ball bounced a yard in front of Southee who was still finishing his follow-through, but managed to stretch his right hand to slightly divert the path of the ball, which eventually went on to hit the stumps at the non-striker's end. Upul Tharanga, who had walked forward some four yards, was forced to only walk back, head down. #p#Wasted review of the day Jayawardene was well aware it was a perfect reverse-swinging yorker form Southee. It was going nowhere except hitting his leg stump as it was pitched in line. Still he asked for a review, which only embarrassed him. It was a sheer waste of time, especially since he knew there was no inside edge. #p#The unluckiest man In the end Lasith Malinga came up with a smile. It was a smile of disbelief. Two catches had been dropped in a space of four deliveries in his fourth over. Also smiling were Jesse Ryder and Ross Taylor, the beneficiaries. Malinga sent a perfectly-pitched short delivery into Ryder's ribs, but he smartly played it off his hips, albeit in the air. It seemed to be going straight to Upul Tharanga at midwicket, but the fielder messed it up. Two balls later, Taylor slashed hard at another short delivery, pitched outside the line of off stump. He was too early into the shot, and it seemed an easy catch as the ball travelled towards Nuwan Kulasekara at third man. But Kulasekera committed the fatal error of moving forward. Just as he did that the ball rushed too fast onto him and he only managed to spike it over the ropes. A catch that should have been a single at most ended up being a six. #p#The Murali moment It was the duel between the two oldest players from both teams. Muttiah Muralitharan was in his element, having already managed to get rid of Kane Williamson and Ross Taylor with his loopy offspinners. He had pulled his hamstring while running between the wickets but that did not stop him from jumping high in the air as soon as Scott Styris scooped a return catch to him. With both his legs in the air and the arms raised high to hold the catch, Murali resembled a spiker more than a cricketer. For sure he had spiked New Zealand's momentum.

Report : Murali and Sangakkara ease Sri Lanka top Audio/Video: Ross Taylor: Disappointing result Players/Officials: Mahela Jayawardene | Nathan McCullum | Kumar Sangakkara | Ross Taylor Matches: New Zealand v Sri Lanka at Mumbai Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: New Zealand | Sri Lanka #p#Ross Taylor, New Zealand's stand-in captain, has said that if technology cannot be conclusive it should just not be used. Taylor's remarks came in the wake of the controversial return catch of Mahela Jayawardene during the Sri Lanka innings, which was pouched spectacularly by Nathan McCullum who threw himself to his right to hold the catch inches above the ground. But the third umpire ruled the decision against New Zealand. #p#Jayawardene went for a premeditated push towards the leg side, but was surprised by a slower delivery from McCullum which arrived late. Having rushed into the shot, Jayawardene could only watch the ball loop towards the unmanned space at silly mid-on. But McCullum leaped from the spot where he had finished his follow-through as if he was standing on a diving board. Amazingly he managed to get the tips of the fingers of his outstretched right hand under the ball. #p#Viewed from the press box, which is behind the bowler's arm, the first reaction was that the catch was taken on the first bounce. But numerous close replays indicated McCullum had actually held one of the catches of the tournament. His reaction was nothing short of ecstatic: he picked himself up and stamped the ground with one foot and pirouetted delightedly. But Jayawardene had his doubts and asked Asad Rauf, one of the on-field umpires, to refer the decision to the TV umpire. Moments later, third umpire Amiesh Saheba gave Jayawardene the benefit of the doubt, much to the chagrin of McCullum. Along with his captain Ross Taylor, both men argued with the on-field umpire Rauf briefly before leaving with their heads shaking. Simon Doull, the former New Zealand fast bowler, was livid in the commentary box and was adamant about the authenticity of the catch. #p#It was a critical moment in the match when Sri Lanka were struggling at 87 for 2 after 23.1 overs with Jayawardene on 26. "I haven't seen the catch, I have seen it only live. I thought it was carried, but the third umpire obviously had other things," Taylor said after the match. "When you generally think that you have taken the catch, it's your natural instinct. It is disappointing." #p#Asked if he would prefer the batsman taking a fielder's words in such a situation, Taylor said he would not rule that out. "It depends upon the person. You look at Jacques Kallis; he asks the fielders if they caught it cleanly and he trusts the words of the fielders. You put it up to the batsman to make the decision and at the end of the day you just hope the technology is right and if the technology is not right, well then don't use it." #p#Kumar Sangakkara, Sri Lanka's captain and Jayawardene's batting partner at the time of the incident, differed. According to Sangakkara, his team-mate had the right to ask for a referral. "I was completely blocked from behind. Mahela was very honest and he said he was not sure he caught it cleanly," Sangakkara said. "Mahela is someone who walks when he nicks it and if he saw Nathan had taken a clean catch he wouldn't have come around. He wasn't very sure and the umpires weren't sure because they were unsighted, so they checked with the technology and they went in favour of Mahela." #p#Sangakkara pointed out that during the New Zealand innings, Brendon McCullum had also waited for the third umpire's ruling on a low catch held at slip by Jayawardene, though it is not certain whether that was simply done in retaliation. "That's the way the game is played," he said. "We had Brendon McCullum stand his ground when Mahela took that catch and they went upstairs and it was proved that it was a clean catch. So it can go either way."
38	506956	New Zealand v Sri Lanka, Group A, World Cup 2011, Mumbai	Taylor identifies loss of wickets as downfall	Nagraj Gollapudi at the Wankhede Stadium	March 18, 2011	#p#New Zealand may wonder how far they have progressed after the seven-wicket defeat against Australia three weeks ago. Then, as now, their batsmen failed to build partnerships. Then, as now, New Zealand collapsed without putting up a fight. The only difference: back then they were tried by pace, while today the noose was tightened by the spinners. Just replace Mitchell Johnson, Shaun Tait and Brett Lee with Muttiah Muralitharan, Ajantha Mendis and Lasith Malinga. #p#So have New Zealand become such an easy picking? Kumar Sangakkara, the Sri Lanka captain, was confident that New Zealand never liked the variety in his bowling attack. And it was not a recent allergy they had developed. "We kind of understand that they find the variation in our bowling attack a bit troublesome," Sangakkara said after the 112-run victory. "They find Mendis, Malinga and Murali quite difficult, so we try to maximise on that particular fact." #p#The only time New Zealand's batsmen showed some promise was when Jesse Ryder and Ross Taylor were steadily beginning to rebuild the innings after the early loss of the openers. Ryder was timing the ball well, while Taylor showed the same spirit visible during his match-winning century against Pakistan. But it was not an easy pitch - it was taking sufficient turn, and coupled with a good bounce, it was a shot in the arm for the spinners. Also the dew made the ball skid. Patience was New Zealand's life vest. Sadly their batsmen left too many loose ends and lost their way pretty quickly. #p#After the demoralising loss to Australia, John Wright, the New Zealand coach, had imposed a condition that it was mandatory the top order lasted for at least 35 overs. The other rider was that not more than three wickets could be lost. On Friday, the New Zealand innings folded in exactly 35 overs. "We just did not get there," Taylor, New Zealand's stand-in captain for the game, said. "We put plans in place to try to achieve them and today we did not do it." #p#Jesse Ryder timed the ball well before he edged one from Ajantha Mendis Getty Images Enlarge #p#It would be harsh to single out Taylor because he was only filling in for the injured Daniel Vettori, who has been sidelined by a knee injury. Also, the absence of Kyle Mills, a frontline bowler, has not helped matters. New Zealand's problems were aggravated when Hamish Bennett, Mill's replacement, was forced to leave the field midway into his fifth over after he picked up a calf strain. #p#Taylor felt that Bennett's absence in the crucial middle overs allowed Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene to establish themselves and lay a good foundation. "In losing Hamish Bennett, we lost a little bit of firepower during the middle stages. But the way we came back to restrict them to 260 with a bowler down was not too bad. But we just kept losing wickets. At the end we were up with the rate but when you keep losing wicket 260 becomes a big target." #p#The loss will not hurt New Zealand's cause much as they have already booked a quarter-finals' berth. Even if it is not yet clear who their opponent will be, Taylor felt that it was important for the players to regroup fast and start from a new page. "The confidence would have taken a dent. But we have played some good cricket over the last little while. We have got to think positively. In the next couple of days we will know who our opponents are and then plan accordingly. The break allows us to recover from the injury toll."
38	506961	New Zealand v Sri Lanka, Group A, World Cup 2011, Mumbai	Sangakkara takes command	Nagraj Gollapudi at the Wankhede Stadium	March 18, 2011	Kumar Sangakkara found the perfect balance between defence and attack en route to his first one-day century since June 2008 Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Report : Murali and Sangakkara ease Sri Lanka top Audio/Video: Kumar Sangakkara: Good for our confidence Players/Officials: Kumar Sangakkara Matches: New Zealand v Sri Lanka at Mumbai Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: New Zealand | Sri Lanka #p#It was a simple punch. He did not finish the shot, just left the bat hanging mid-air briefly. The power behind the stroke was enough to carry the ball past the ropes on the straight boundary. Hamish Bennett had not done much wrong, except pitching on a length with a straighter delivery on the offstump. But Kumar Sangakkara had moved in quickly to time the ball sweetly. He did not need to add the flourish by finishing the follow-through. It was a stroke of authority. #p#Sangakkara played many such elegant strokes on Friday at the Wankhede Stadium, both along the ground and lofted drives, but with every stroke he strengthened his and Sri Lanka's grip over the match. On Friday, he played an innings as much of belief as of desire. #p#Sri Lanka had a disastrous start, losing both openers inside the first half hour. The onus was on Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene to remain solid considering the fact that the rest of the middle-order batsmen had not clocked enough time in the middle in the previous matches. Sri Lanka had to win this match in order to strengthen their chances of playing the quarter-finals and the semi-finals in front of a home crowd. #p#Twenty-three thousand fans turned up at the Wankhede, which has a capacity of about 33,000, and most cheers were reserved for the Sri Lankans. Still New Zealand's bowlers did not make the job easier for the Lankan duo. Backed by supremely athletic fielding, New Zealand cramped their opponents. After 10 overs, Sri Lanka were 43 for 2. Five overs later, at the end of the bowling Powerplay, only 17 had been added. With 20 overs left, Sri Lanka were 124 for 2. #p#Even Jayawardene, a fluent player on any surface, was finding it hard to dominate. It was the most vital phase in the match. If Sri Lanka threw caution to the wind but failed in the gamble, then New Zealand would take the upperhand. But if Sangakkara and Jaywardene continued steadfastly, there would come a time when they could break free with the knowledge that the likes of Angelo Mathews was yet to come. Unfortunately Jayawardene was defeated by a Waqar Younis (reverse-swinging toe crusher) from Tim Southee on the very first ball of the batting Powerplay. #p#Days like these bring a different set of challenges to even a batsman like Sangakkara, who became the fourth Sri Lanka batsman to breach the 9000-run mark in one-dayers. It is on days like these that a batsman analyses his game completely, works out every stroke he is going to play in his mind before playing it, understands the field inside out, calculates the best bowler(s) to target, does a quick reconnaissance of the field before each over to identify gaps he could take advantage of. It is not that these measures are not taken by a batsman in every match, but most times there is a larger freedom for the batsman to take liberties, which was not readily available on Friday. #p#A good example of Sangakkara's improvisation came two overs into the batting Powerplay. Tim Southee had pitched it short and wide outside off stump and had been duly slapped for a four and six. To escape further punishment, Southee ran in to bowl the next delivery from around the stumps. The idea was to bowl from wide off the crease, keep it short and bowl into the body of Sangakkara. Southee had covered his bases cleverly by keeping the third man and the fine leg on the boundary, just as insurance. So what does Sangakkara do to counter the challenge? He moves outside the leg stump, lines up parallel to the delivery, before cutting it in front of square and over point for a handsome six. #p#The amazing thing about the stroke was Sangakkara did not upper cut it. He used the pace of the ball to place it perfectly. In the first two overs of the batting Powerplay only eight runs came; in the following two 32 runs were smacked. Like he had said on the eve of the match, Sangakkara was not going to lose his head when the field was up. The idea was to play the field to his advantage. Importantly, the platform had been laid for the lower order to bolster the innings further. #p#This is the third World Cup for Sangakkara and this was his maiden century in the event, and also his first one-day hundred in three years. In the 63 innings between the last hundred and Friday's century, Sangakkara has got 19 fifties. It is not that he does not like getting hundreds. He is a tenacious character. It is just that he read the match situation perfectly on Friday. #p#"Understanding when to accelerate and when to consolidate in your innings is the key," he said after the match. "When that kind of self-realisation comes through it makes it easier to score runs. I have got close a few times and probably I concentrated less on getting a hundred, and probably more on doing what was needed to be done at that moment." #p#In the ICC's Test batsmen rankings, Sangakkara is just one point behind Sachin Tendulkar and Jacques Kallis. In the longer versions he has shower more grit than in the one-dayers. It might be a mental thing. He is seventh on the ODI rankings. Ahead of him are men like Hashim Amla, AB de Villiers, Michael Hussey and MS Dhoni - men who have created more impact on their team's results more consistently. If Sangakkara wants an example of how to influence one's team, he need look no further than fellow Sri Lankan Aravinda de Silva, another batsman who played according to the situation during Sri Lanka's victorious campaign in 1996. de Silva's contrasting knocks in the semi-finals and the final are part of cricket's folklore. #p#So far this tournament, Sangakkara has stressed on the fact that the real test lies in the knockout stages. Whatever has happened so far will, and does, not matter. The do-or-die match is where the heroes will be remembered. He could do well to listen to those words.

"In the next few days we got to pay as much attention as we can to Murali's injury and get him on his feet for the next game. Going back to Sri Lanka for him is going to be important in that sense." #p#Murali, who will retire after the World Cup, said the injury wouldn't hinder his participation in the rest of the tournament. "I have been carrying this hamstring injury for some time and it's not a problem. I am prepared to play the rest of the matches because I am retiring after the World Cup." #p#Muralitharan hurt his knee as he dived to avoid getting run out and was limping during New Zealand's chase, leaving the field twice to receive treatment. He returned and virtually bowled on one leg during a spell of 4 for 25, which helped Sri Lanka win by 112 runs. #p#"Murali did a pretty okay job bowling off one leg and getting us all those wickets. He bowled beautifully," said Sangakkara. "Murali's done it before with an injury in Australia and he nearly won us a game there. Here it was something special, it shows how hungry he is to play and do well."
39	506862	Bangladesh v South Africa, Group B, World Cup 2011, Mirpur	Bangladesh wary of South African pace	Firdose Moonda in Mirpur	March 18, 2011	The Bangladesh batting redeemed itself in the game against England Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: Shakib Al Hasan Matches: Bangladesh v South Africa at Dhaka Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Bangladesh #p#Of all the questions Shakib Al Hasan had to answer at his pre-match press conference in Dhaka, the one about the score was asked most often. How much would Bangladesh like to put on the board to feel safe if they bat first? How much would they be comfortable chasing? How much do they think South Africa would be looking at? #p#Eventually Shakib chose to answer in the simplest way possible. "If we bat first we'll have to put on a good total and if we bowl first we'll have to restrict them," he said, wiping his brow. It was probably another way of saying "I don't know" but instead of being that basic he added another line for good measure: 'I haven't seen the wicket yet so I am not sure." #p#Amongst all those questions the number 58 was not mentioned once, neither were any of the connotations that have come with it. Bangladesh last played in Dhaka on the day that they were bowled out for 58, by the West Indies, a loss that revealed an ugly side to fans that have been welcoming and proud of their status as World Cup hosts. Since then, Bangladesh have recovered admirably, showing that they can handle pressure by chasing 225 to beat England in a tight finish. #p#That's what Shakib is focusing on. "Throughout this tournament we have played well, even though people have said that we haven't batted enough." That was enough to prompt another round of numbers questions, this time about individual scores. "We've seen even Associate players score centuries at this World Cup, but not one of the Bangladesh batsman has done so," said the questioner, who stopped right there, not bothering to ask anything, just wanting Shakib to respond to what's being perceived as batting failings. #p#"Only Virender Sehwag and Virat Kohli have scored centuries in Bangladesh in the tournament," he said, referring to the opening match in which India put on 370 for 4. "That was a different wicket and we scored 280 in it. No other team has scored more than 250." The pitch at Dhaka is known to be tricky for batsmen, with the average score for a team batting first just 231 - a far cry from the scores in excess of 300 that recent ODIs have seen. #p#It's hardly the sort of surface that a batting side under pressure will look to play on. What it is is the kind of pitch that promotes character building. It's the type that will reward the man who can withstand an assault from seam bowlers and spinners, who can show patience and who can build an innings with hard work rather than come out and expect to wave his bat around like a wand to conjure up a big score. #p#It's also the kind of pitch that bowlers will look forward to playing on, particularly a bowling unit that has dismissed all five of the teams they have faced so far. South Africa have a 100% record in the bowling department and with the discipline and variation they have, they will want to hold on to that. It's the most varied attack South Africa ever had at a World Cup and they've kept things fluid by mixing up the combinations. They've opened twice with a spinner, rotated the bowlers creatively and bowled to specific plans. #p#Shakib said that although the South Africans spinners are bowling "reasonably well" it's not them that the Bangladesh batsmen are worried about. "We'll have to be careful about their fast bowlers too." South Africa have bowled Bangladesh out for 173 and 143 on this surface before, in March 2008, with seamers claiming 12 of the 20 wickets. Those may turn out to be numbers most worth concentrating on.
39	506888	Bangladesh v South Africa, Group B, World Cup 2011, Mirpur	Now or never for Bangladesh	The Preview by Sidharth Monga	March 18, 2011	Bangladesh need Tamim Iqbal to step up Associated Press Enlarge Related Links Features : Can Bangladesh keep the party alive? Matches: Bangladesh v South Africa at Dhaka Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Bangladesh | South Africa #p#Match Facts March 19, Mirpur Start time 09.30 am (03.30 GMT) #p#The Big Picture The back-door is shut now. Had West Indies won their game last night, Bangladesh would have made it through to the quarter-finals. As it turned out, the game between West Indies and England twisted and turned, went inside-out, upside-down, before England bit another bullet and stayed alive in the tournament. Surely about a 1000 miles north, the Bangladesh players watched in hope and later in agony in their team hotel in Dhaka. Thanks to that result, Bangladesh are now a point behind England, and a long way behind every contender in terms of net run-rate. There is an upside too: Bangladesh no longer need to watch helplessly, hoping for some other team to do what is desirable for them. #p#It's relatively simple now: beat South Africa and go through, no who-does-what elsewhere in the group. However, just the thought and the equation are simple, not actually beating South Africa, whose pace attack - even on the slow and low pitch at Mirpur - will provide the hosts with their biggest test. South Africa have also been on a bit of a roll, their tight win against India cancelling out the close defeat to England. They will want to finish at the top of the table, and hence face the fourth-placed team in Group A. Given how this World Cup has gone, it might not be the most desirable thing to do, for it could mean they might have to face Sri Lanka in Sri Lanka. #p#There is no reason why Bangladesh shouldn't back themselves, though. They have beaten South Africa in a World Cup before, they have the advantage of home conditions, they have had back-to-back wins, but they also know this is not going to be easy. It's been a funny World Cup so far: Bangladesh, bowled out for 58 by West Indies, were supporting West Indies yesterday; England, great rivals of South Africa, will be supporting South Africa tomorrow, as will be West Indies. #p#Graeme Smith certainly doesn't want to miss a poke at England. "I think English fans are getting used to supporting South Africans these days," he said on the eve of this game. #p#What happens if  South Africa win : Bangladesh are knocked out, and India, England and West Indies go through #p#Bangladesh win : Bangladesh go through, leaving West Indies a must-win game against India #p#The game is tied or no-result : England go through thanks to a superior net run-rate, and Bangladesh are left hoping West Indies lose their game on Sunday #p#Form guide (completed matches, most recent first) Bangladesh WWLWL South Africa WWLWW #p#Pitch and conditions The Bangladesh part of the World Cup returns to Shere Bangla Stadium in Mirpur, where Bangladesh will like a turning surface, but it is not quite possible to create a rank turner in Mirpur. The best they can manage is the low and slow pitch that they rolled out for Ireland. There is no rain forecast, and there shouldn't be too much of early-morning freshness for this day game, because the sun is already about three-and-a-half hours old by the 9.30 am start in Bangladesh. #p#Watch out for... Bangladesh's best batsman, Tamim Iqbal , hasn't had a great World Cup, and he knows how much rests on him. He will want to set that record straight, and make sure this is not his last chance in the tournament. #p#Graeme Smith has had his share of problems at the top of the order, but playing Bangladesh in Bangladesh provides him with a fairly good challenge before the knockouts. #p#Team news Bangladesh won't make too many changes to their winning combination, except that offspinner Naeem Islam is likely to replace left-arm spinner Suhrawadi Shuvo, on account of a few left-hand batsmen in the South African line-up. #p#Bangladesh (probable): 1 Tamim Iqbal, 2 Imrul Kayes, 3 Junaid Siddique, 4 Shahriar Nafees, 5 Shakib Al Hasan (capt), 6 Mushfiqur Rahim (wk), 7 Mahmudullah, 8 Suhrawadi Shuvo / Naeem Islam, 9 Abdur Razzak, 10 Shafiul Islam, 11 Rubel Hossain. #p#South Africa are back to full fitness, and Imran Tahir may come back in place of either Johan Botha or Robin Peterson. If AB de Villiers comes back, he might not keep, which might mean that Colin Ingram, despite his 46 against Ireland, might have to sit out. #p#South Africa (probable): 1 Graeme Smith (capt), 2 Hashim Amla, 3 Jacques Kallis, 4 AB de Villiers, 5 JP Duminy, 6 Faf du Plessis, 7 Morne van Wyk (wk), 8 Johan Botha / Imran Tahir, 9 Robin Peterson, 10 Dale Steyn, 11 Morne Morkel #p#Stats #p#No Bangladesh batsman has scored a World Cup century. #p#The only time Bangladesh have beaten South Africa in international cricket was in Providence in the previous World Cup. #p#AB de Villiers, with 318 runs from four innings, is the only middle-order batsman in the top-six run-getters of the tournament so far. #p#Quotes "We are on the right track and moving forward to our target as we already have won three matches out of five as per our expectation. Everything is okay with the team, but still we believe that we are yet to play our best cricket in the tournament." Tamim Iqbal calls for his team to play the best they can #p#"They need to win the game. We expect a very passionate crowd. They will also be the team under pressure so we hope to be able to force them into doing things they wouldn't want to do." Graeme Smith knows who will be more desperate come Saturday
39	506899	Bangladesh v South Africa, Group B, World Cup 2011, Mirpur	Looking to lead from the front again - Smith	Firdose Moonda in Mirpur	March 18, 2011	Graeme Smith's highest score in this World Cup has been 45 against West Indies Associated Press Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: Graeme Smith Matches: Bangladesh v South Africa at Dhaka Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: South Africa #p#When a 22-year-old Graeme Smith was given the biggest job in South African cricket, Dhaka was the venue of his first assignment. He had to lead the side to a seven-match tri-series involving the hosts and India, in which South Africa won three of the four round-robin matches they played. The final, between South Africa and India, was washed out. #p#Now, eight years on, Smith is ending his tenure as captain and one of the stops on his last assignment is Dhaka. He seems to have fond memories of the place where it all began. "It was a bit up and down at the start, but in the last four years or so I've really felt in control," he said. "From around 2008, I've seen us reap rewards and begun to understand what's required of me. I've had a team that I felt I could really say is mine." #p#It's interesting that Smith should pick 2008 as the time when things began changing. That was time enough after South Africa's Caribbean World Cup semi-final exit to have a fresh look at the one-day set-up and left time enough to build before the tournament's next edition. In between that they had major Test series to concentrate on as well, and won in England and Australia while drawing in India. They ended up losing the ODI series' that followed those Test wins but 2008 marked the start of South Africa playing to plans, a phrase that encompasses various things we've seen at this World Cup. Like rotating players within the squad to suit conditions and targeting specific players in calculated ways. #p#It's involved doing a lot of homework, but almost all of it has paid off. When Smith opened the bowling with an offspinner to Chris Gayle, he had him out within three balls. When he opened with a left-arm spinner to Kevin Pietersen, the same happened. They wanted to target the Indians bowlers in the Powerplay and the way they batted in that period won them the match. Similar research has been done for the match against Bangladesh. #p#Smith looked like an eager school kid as he reeled off the things he had learnt about Bangladesh so far. "We've seen that they have averaged 40 to 41 overs of spin with the ball, so we expect a lot of that. They have seven left handers and play well on the front foot but if we can put pressure on them from the start, they don't have a huge confidence base." #p#Smith emphasised that even though South Africa have qualified for the quarter-finals, they are not going to slack off. It has nothing to do with the win that Bangladesh earned over South Africa in the 2007 World Cup. "There is no added emotion from our perspective and no revenge talk," Smith said. "Four years it a lot of time to let things go." #p#What there might be is an eagerness to show how much they have improved from that day in Guyana, when a confident 87 from Mohammed Ashraful and a strangling bowling performance from Shakib Al Hasan and Abdur Razzak saw South Africa bowled out for 184, chasing 252. #p#"We used to rely on brute force in the past, but we are more subtle now," Smith said. The spinners, for a start, have added to the finesse. All three frontline spinners, Imran Tahir, Robin Peterson and Johan Botha, have been among the wickets but, as is the nature of their trade, it's out-thinking the batsman that has done the trick more than scaring them. Hashim Amla and AB de Villiers have scored picture-perfect centuries and JP Duminy a gritty 99. #p#They've been "street-smart" as Smith likes to call it but that doesn't mean their bullying days are done. Dale Steyn and Morne Morkel can bruise teams upfront, and given that South Africa are determined to pressurise Bangaldesh from the outset, that's what they will be looking to do. #p#Smith himself may indulge in a bit of the bullying. The captain has been struggling for form, the 45 he scored against West Indies his highest score of the tournament. "It's been frustrating," he said. "I've got a lot of starts and haven't been able to capitalise on them." Getting significant time at the crease and having a good knock is vital to Smith for another reason - it how he shows his ability as a leader. "It's an important time for me to do well. For a long time I have led from the front and I would like to get back to doing that." #p#Maybe it wouldn't be so crucial to have a defining innings if Smith wasn't wrapping up his stint at the helm. For now, his time is all about the experiences and he hopes Bangladesh will give him one to add to his collection. "It's going to be wonderful for us to play here in this World Cup. We know the crowd are going to be behind Bangladesh, we'll be up for it."
39	506909	Bangladesh v South Africa, Group B, World Cup 2011, Mirpur	Can Bangladesh keep the party alive?	Firdose Moonda in Mirpur	March 18, 2011	Will Bangladesh manage a repeat of the heady scenes from the England game? Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Preview : Now or never for Bangladesh Players/Officials: Shakib Al Hasan | Graeme Smith Matches: Bangladesh v South Africa at Dhaka Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Bangladesh | South Africa #p#The Lobby Café at the Sheraton Hotel where the South Africa and Bangladesh teams are staying emptied out faster than a stadium does after England beat West Indies. The romantic cricket-watching scene of noses pressed against glass with curious eyes straining to see the screen had played out when Andre Russell and Ramnaresh Sarwan were batting. When the collapse began, those cricket lovers disappeared, their hopes of Bangladesh easing into the quarter-finals gone with them. #p#At the end, only one smiling policeman remained. "I am very happy," he said. "I am very happy because if Bangladesh were to get into the quarter-finals because of the West Indies beating England, that is not good. They should rather get in by beating South Africa. That is very good." #p#Pride is what he was talking about. In recent weeks, Bangladesh have had plenty to be proud about. Their role as hosts of the World Cup is something that they are treasuring, something that they hope will put them on the global map in the same light as South Africa has been since the football World Cup. Tourists are welcomed with the words "Thank you for coming to Bangladesh," Dhaka is transformed into something magical at night with fairy lights on all the streets and there are posters advertising the tournament and the team everywhere. #p#The Bangladesh team are a dominant feature in the marketing campaign, because without them the tournament would hold far less value to the public. The team, in good touch before the event when they blanked New Zealand at home, came in as a strong contender to qualify for the knockout stage. It was the first time in the history of Bangladesh cricket that there was pressure on the team of this nature - the pressure of expectation - and now the moment has arrived where the limits of testing that pressure will be reached. #p#Bangladesh could not have expected it to be easy - with India, South Africa and England in their group. They probably eyed West Indies as the soft targets, the men in decline with a record of inconsistency that could see them fold at some stage of a six-match league. That didn't go according to plan and West Indies earned the most resounding of wins against them. It was a serious reality check of everything, from where they stand in world cricket to what they need to do to qualify for the quarter-finals. #p#In a beautiful twist of irony, one of the things they needed was for West Indies to beat England. That would have given Bangladesh a clear passage to the knockouts. It meant that the same team whose bus was stoned, accidentally or not, when they beat Bangladesh, was being cheered on in earnest. It would have been a less dignified way to qualify for the quarters, but it would have been a way, and that may have been all that mattered. #p#The team themselves don't seem to have placed too much importance on the West Indies loss, knowing that they can't expect favours on the road to success. Shakib Al Hasan didn't even watch the whole match. "When Chris Gayle was batting, I was watching. After that, I watched Hindi movies," he said. It may have been that he wanted to get away from the cricket for a while, but it's likely that he was avoiding the goings-on in Chennai because he wanted to get the mindset right and it seems he has. #p#"We have to fight to get to the quarter-finals ourselves," he said. It's a tough ask, but they can take comfort in knowing that the World Cup has usually provided the stage to pull off a big upset. In 1999, they did it against Pakistan, in 2007 they did it twice, to make up for not doing it in 2003. First, they axed a giant, beating India by five wickets and ultimately sending them out of the tournament. Then, they were a banana skin for South Africa in the Super Eights, something that will no doubt be a source of motivation ahead of tomorrow's match. #p#Bangladesh are enjoying their role as World Cup hosts Associated Press Enlarge #p#The biggest inspiration should come from within though. Bangladesh have made strides towards being a credible cricketing nation in the recent past. Graeme Smith, South Africa's captain, said the "knockouts will make the World Cup because it will feature the best teams in the world." Bangladesh would dearly love to be counted among those. #p#Beyond wins over Associates and the odd triumph against Zimbabwe, they whitewashed the West Indies away from home and did the same against New Zealand. The only way they can prove how much they have improved and how seriously they can be taken is with their actions on the cricket field. #p#Their fans will come into the fray - with the passion they are showing for the game seeing Bangladesh talked about as the new market for cricket. It's no secret that keeping a host in a tournament for as long as possible keeps interest alive in the event, but for this host to stay in the tournament will do more than just give the competition life. It will give it boisterousness, it will give it energy, it will give it a new character. #p#It will give all those people the reasons they need to keep believing and to keep supporting. It will bring back those who turned away from the café, because they didn't think Bangladesh could do it for themselves. #p#At the far end of that restaurant a few South African players were sitting as the support dwindled. Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel, Morne van Wyk, Colin Ingram and Johan Botha watched with amused smiles as the West Indies did the ch--- better than South Africa in Chennai. They saw, first-hand, what it will mean for the public if Bangladesh get through and they will be braced for a tough fight when the players step onto the Shere Bangla field.
39	506964	Bangladesh v South Africa, Group B, World Cup 2011, Mirpur	Abject Bangladesh surrender meekly	The Bulletin by Abhishek Purohit	March 19, 2011	#p#South Africa 284 for 8 (Kallis 69, du Plessis 52, Amla 51, Rubel 3-56) beat Bangladesh 78 (Shakib 30, Peterson 4-12, Tsotsobe 3-14) by 206 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details #p#Lonwabo Tsotsobe scuttled Bangladesh's chase inside eight overs Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Analysis : South Africa made the ideal changes Features : The great Bangla tragedy Matches: Bangladesh v South Africa at Dhaka Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Bangladesh | South Africa #p#Bangladesh were not favourites to win their virtual pre-quarterfinal against the might of South Africa, especially after the visitors breezed away to 284, but it was the meek manner of their abject batting surrender that would have jarred even their most faithful fans. Eight overs in to the tall chase, and the heart of their batting line-up had been ripped out by Lonwabo Tsotsobe, causing the substantial crowd at the Shere Bangla Stadium to quickly start dwindling. They never recovered from those initial blows, and all they managed was to beat their lowest total of 58 achieved against West Indies earlier in the tournament by 20 runs, before being put out of their misery by Robin Peterson's fourth wicket. #p#This was after South Africa came out blazing in the morning, and the solid base that the openers gave allowed Jacques Kallis and Faf du Plessis to consolidate and accelerate seamlessly, giving their spin-heavy attack a substantial cushion to stifle Bangladesh and bowl them to the top the group. That they did so with 206 runs to spare was a testimony to how the fight completely went out of Bangladesh, and also confirmed England's qualification for the knockouts. #p#It was not that South Africa's attack, minus Dale Steyn and Morne Morkel, held a lot of alarms. Tsotsobe did get enough bounce off the slow wicket to trouble the batsmen, and also got it to cut in from a very tight line outside off stump. But it was more a case of poor shot selection by the Bangladesh batsmen under the pressure of a big chase in a must-win game in front of a large home crowd. The first four dismissals were demonstrations of the various ways of how not to play on a low and slow wicket. #p#Smart Stats The 206-run defeat is the second largest for Bangladesh in ODIs and their largest margin of defeat in World Cups. The previous highest margin of defeat in World Cups was the 198-run loss to Sri Lanka in 2007 This is Bangladesh's second score below 100 in World Cups. They now share the record for most team scores below 100 with Canada, Namibia and Ireland. Bangladesh's 78 is their sixth-lowest score in ODIs and their lowest against against South Africa. Three of their top six lowest scores have come in Dhaka. Bangladesh scored just seven runs in the bowling Powerplay which is the lowest score by a team in the bowling Powerplay in the tournament. The previous lowest was nine runs by Kenya against Sri Lanka. Bangladesh have been much more poorer in ODIs in Mirpur than in the games played in Chittagong. They have been bowled out twice under 100 in Mirpur and average just 16. In Chittagong, they average 32.75 and score at a slightly higher run rate. The 98-run stand between Hashim Amla and Graeme Smith is the 14th fifty-plus stand between the pair for the opening wicket in ODIs. They are behind the South African record of 21 fifty-plus stands which is jointly held by Herschelle Gibbs and Smith and Gibbs and Gary Kirsten. Jacques Kallis became the highest run getter for South Africa in World Cups after going past Gibbs' tally of 1067 runs. The win is South Africa's eighth by a margin of 200 runs or more in ODIs. It is also the third-largest margin of victory for South Africa in World Cups. Robin Peterson's 4 for 12 is his best bowling performance in ODIs surpassing his 3 for 22 against England in Chennai. #p#Tamim Iqbal was too early into the pull off a short Tsotsobe delivery that was way outside off stump, and was caught behind off a healthy under-edge, as South Africa referred successfully after umpire Daryl Harper missed the deflection. Imrul Kayes shouldered arms to a full Tsotsobe delivery that cut back in to shatter the stumps. Graeme Smith had started with Johan Botha, and his suffocating lines had Junaid Siddique in absolute uncertainty, not sure whether to go back or forward, and he ended up being trapped in front by one that went straight on. Shahriar Nafees played on, driving in princely fashion from the crease to one that nipped back in slowly. #p#Bangladesh's chase was only eight overs old, and already their dream had caved in at 21 for 4. Mushfiqur Rahim pottered around for some time before being snapped up one-handed by an alert Smith at slip off Peterson. Before his dismissal, Bangladesh managed seven runs in the bowling Powerplay, the lowest in the tournament, trumping Kenya who had made nine runs against Sri Lanka. #p#Amid all the anti-climax, Shakib Al Hasan displayed his class, straight-driving and pulling Tsotsobe, and caressing and slashing the spinners for boundaries. There were loud cheers as Bangladesh passed 58 but Shakib departed soon after as Bangladesh's party rapidly came to a rude end. Peterson cleaned up the tail as Bangladesh lasted all of 28 overs to bring the curtain down on what was ultimately a chaotic campaign. #p#Bangladesh's struggles stood out against the contrasting approaches of Hashim Amla and Graeme Smith, which had worked perfectly for South Africa at the top as the duo batted their way to a 98-run opening stand. It was fascinating to see how the openers went about tackling the spinners in their different styles. While Amla allowed the ball to come to him, and played it as late as possible off the back foot, Smith was very eager to push forward and use his feet frequently in an attempt to meet the ball early. #p#Amla carried on in the nonchalant fashion that has made him the world's most prolific one-day batsman of late. Anything marginally short was quickly dispatched, even against the turn. Smith was uncertain to start with, but Bangladesh helped him settle the nerves with a couple of freebies on leg stump that he happily put away past short fine leg. #p#It was only after the drinks break that the openers lost their cool and their wickets. JP Duminy followed and at 141 for 3 with 20 overs to go, Bangladesh were in it. But Kallis and du Plessis started milking the singles calmly. Only four boundaries were hit in the next 12 overs but South Africa still scored at five an over. The duo added 82 risk-free runs inside 15 overs as the Bangladesh attack struggled for penetration. #p#Peterson did not let South Africa miss the seventh batsman they had left out, clattering 22 in nine deliveries as 83 came off the last eight overs. Even though wickets tumbled late, there was enough spunk in Peterson and Botha to lift South Africa to 284. It turned out to be much more than sufficient for a Bangladesh outfit that finally lost the spark that had made it come back strongly twice in the tournament after crushing losses to West Indies and India, with wins over England, Ireland, and Netherlands. #p#Match Timeline
39	507022	Bangladesh v South Africa, Group B, World Cup 2011, Mirpur	Shoddy display, sarcastic applause	Firdose Moonda in Mirpur	March 19, 2011	The fans started to make their way out as soon as the Bangladesh top order folded Associated Press Enlarge Related Links Matches: Bangladesh v South Africa at Dhaka Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Bangladesh | South Africa #p#The perfect placement Jacques Kallis had played his way cautiously to 30, rotating the strike with Hashim Amla and managing two boundaries. Then, he rolled out a vintage stroke. Shafiul Islam bowled a regular, on-a-good-length ball and Kallis just presented his bat. He made contact that had better timing than all the clocks in the world. The ball snuck in between Faf du Plessis' legs, evaded a diving Tamim Iqbal, escaped the exasperated Mahmadullah at mid-on too and eased it way to the boundary. Effortless. #p#The mind-the-gap moment Bangladesh cost themselves in the field with some sloppy work but this was the most careless. Abdur Razzak was at point when Kallis cut the ball to him, off the bowling of Shakib Al Hasan. Razzak kneeled down and should have picked it up immediately, giving away no runs in the process, but he somehow allowed the ball into the gap between his left knee and right leg. As it was teasing him, his hands couldn't get around the ball in time and it rolled away for four. #p#The un-noticed 50 Jacques Kallis was playing a low-key innings but he must have expected someone to clap when he reached his half-century. It wasn't brought up in a flashy fashion - a small flick to fine leg, an ambled single. But nobody seemed to notice. As Kallis stood, bat in the air, acknowledging the crowd, there was minimal sounds beyond the constant burble. A section of the crowd must have realised what was going on and offered small applause but most didn't seem too aware that South Africa's greatest all-rounder had reached another milestone. #p#The catch that stuck After a solid display of butter fingers, Shakib Al Hasan finally gave Bangladesh their moment in the field. Jacques Kallis wanted to use the batting Powerplay to capitalise and decided to start from the get-go. He rocked on the back foot and smacked the third ball of the over back to Shakib. It wasn't a clean catch at first, as the captain juggled it on the first attempt but held on it on the second. #p#The tragedy #p#It was only the 8th over of the Bangladesh chase but at 21 for 4, the dream was crashing fast. Lonwabo Tsotsobe had exposed too many weaknesses and what lay before the fans, a raw batting line-up, was too painful for them to see. Rows of seats became empty and dozens of people were making their way to the exit. The dream was dying and they weren't hanging around to see it splutter and struggle its way to the inevitable end. #p#The giant catch #p#Graeme Smith and agile are not two concepts that marry easily, but he showed his nimble side while fielding at slip. Robin Peterson had tempted Mushfiqur Rahim to go onto his front foot and drive and the push from the Bangladeshi batsman resulted in nothing more than an edge. It flew to the right of Smith at first slip and was dipping fast but Smith lunged with his full reach and took the catch. #p#The lowest is over #p#When Shakib Al Hasan gently took a single off Johan Botha on the leg side, in the 21st over, the crowd began to cheer louder than had for the entire Bangladesh innings. Not because they were applauding their captain supreme who had to be a one-man team for much of the match, with the bat and ball, but because the worst they'd seen of this World Cup would not come back to haunt them. That single was the 58th, the same amount that Bangladesh had been bowled out for against the West Indies and they still had five wickets in hand. Even though Mahmadullah was run out on that score, the same ignominy was avoided, but not by much.
39	507061	Bangladesh v South Africa, Group B, World Cup 2011, Mirpur	Everything was a weakness for Bangladesh	Firdose Moonda in Mirpur	March 19, 2011	#p#A devastated Shakib Al Hasan has said his team's performance against South Africa was so poor that he couldn't identify any specific areas of concern. Bangladesh were bowled out for 78, the third lowest total of the tournament, and Shakib could not explain how they fell so far short of the 285 run target. #p#"When you score 180 or 200 you can find those mistakes [that explain why you didn't win]," he said. "But when you are bowled out for 70 or 80, I don't know how you can find those weaknesses. They are all weaknesses." #p#It was a stark admission, but an accurate one. Everything was a weakness. Bangladesh's demise in this match, although it was played out with the bat, was orchestrated with the ball. "Our fast bowlers let us down today," Shakib said. They simply gave away too many runs. Before the match, Shakib said that apart from the opening game, which was played on a different type of wicket, scoring 250 on this surface was a rarity. He knew that it would take a sterling effort with the bat or a feeble one with the ball to allow a first innings total in excess of 250 to be reached. #p#"We thought they had scored 20 runs more," Shakib said, indicating that a target of 265 would have been more acceptable. Had Bangladesh fielded better, they may have found themselves chasing even less as Graeme Smith said that South Africa though 250 was a reasonable total. Instead, balls snuck in between hands and through legs, they weren't hunted down to the boundary as much they were ambled after, and the throws coming in from the outfield were more limp and wayward than strong and purposeful. #p#Shakib Al Hasan is crestfallen after Bangladesh failed to qualify for the knockout stage of the World Cup Associated Press Enlarge #p#While Bangladesh have never been a side known for their fielding prowess, in a match this important they should have put extra effort into the things they can control - things like getting to the ball quickly and keeping the run leakage to a minimum. There were moments of commitment, when fielders in the inner ring pounced like tigers, but those were undone by the number of times an extra few runs were conceded because of a fumble on the rope or a lapse in concentration when a clean pick up would have done the trick. #p#It might be an area of their game they are going to work on or it might be an area of their game that was neglected because of circumstance, the reality of playing in a do-or-die situation. Shakib said that the enormity of the task at hand took its toll and that the ability of the side, which were so determined in another must win match against England, have not changed overnight. "Maybe pressure got to everyone. Maybe the expectation was high and we couldn't handle it. The skill levels are still the same. " #p#It was exactly those skills, which have shown so much improvement in recent times, that had earned Bangladesh the label of being a decent pick for the second round and created the expectation in the first place. With the progress they had made, the team themselves had ambitions of getting to the knockouts and Shakib said there is massive disappointment that they haven't. "Before the tournament we believed that we will qualify for the second round. That was the plan, especially in the home conditions." #p#Having built a strong base at home, Shakib knows that he will have to spend the next few days, and even months, giving answers for his team's shortcomings. He seems to have mastered the way he should do that with regards to this tournament. No excuses, no asking for forgiveness, no justifying, just plainly stating what is glaringly obvious - that in the moments that mattered, Bangladesh didn't turn up. He understands that his team will have an enormous debt to repay to those who believed in them from ball one. "They [the fan] deserve more; we didn't play well at all. The way we were performing for the last 12 months, they were expecting us to do better than we did," he said, and then came the clincher, "but we couldn't."
39	507084	Bangladesh v South Africa, Group B, World Cup 2011, Mirpur	South Africa made the ideal changes	Firdose Moonda in Mirpur	March 19, 2011	#p#Eighty wickets in eight matches, including the warm-up games, and South Africa's bowling can rightly be called the best in the competition to date. No team, except India on a batsmen's paradise in Nagpur, has scored more than 250 against them. #p#The wickets have come from everywhere: the two menacing fast bowlers who were rested in Mirpur - Dale Steyn and Morne Morkel - the offspinner Johan Botha, the left-arm spinner Robin Peterson, the new legspinner Imran Tahir and now even the reserve bowler - Lonwabo Tsotsobe. #p#"I feel very chuffed about it," Tsotsobe said of his 3 for 14 Man-of-the-Match performance against Bangladesh. "It woke me up and said to me that I have to work harder each day. I am still part of the team." #p#Those were the words that made Graeme Smith's smile, already wide as the room itself, even wider. South Africa have been trying to build a team culture that stands out from the ethos they previously had - of being like a boarding school, where authority comes from the top and the rest must follow suit - to a more embracing one where every member of the team is important. The result of that is that when those on the fringes are called on to perform, they don't feel as though they need to step into massive shoes; they simply get on with their job. #p#"From the start we've always been a squad," Smith said, when asked how pleasing it was that Tsotsobe had come in and performed with such aplomb. Tsotsobe was the leading wicket-taker in the recent home one-day series against India and, on the face of it, it looked as though he was being left out of side at just the wrong time, when he was trying to establish himself as the vital third prong in the seam attack. "It was very difficult for us to leave Lopsy out, he has been very good for us," Smith said. #p#Lonwabo Tsotsobe took 3 for 14 in his first match of the World Cup Getty Images Enlarge #p#It turned out to be somewhat of a stroke of genius to rest Steyn and Morkel and bring in Tsotsobe and Wayne Parnell, the two left-armers who sat on the sidelines for the first five group games. The hunger of the two pacers had been building for over a month. They had seen the way the West Indies pace attack had torn through the Bangladesh line-up and they knew that with a fragile confidence base they may be able to do the same, especially with the number of left-handers in the Bangladesh line-up. #p#It was the ideal way to bring Tsotsobe and Parnell into the tournament, because with South Africa comfortably through to the quarter-finals, it would have been easy for the team to slack off. Bringing in two squad members who would not have thought of slacking off at all was the master move. Smith recognised the team needed to find that extra fire from within. "We could have easily gone through the motions when we had them five down," he said. "But it was good to see the commitment of the guys." #p#Instead of releasing the brake when they had Bangladesh at 36 for 5, they slammed on it harder and that's what Smith was proud of. "It was good to see the guys putting their bodies on the line." The fielding was their way of squeezing the life out of the Bangladesh batsmen. It seemed like a brutal way to handle a team that were clearly under the cosh and that were going to surrender at any point. Instead of letting Bangladesh admit defeat on their own terms, South Africa wanted to dictate proceedings. #p#That's the best preparation for the quarter-finals, where South Africa's real test begins. They've talked about taking it one game at a time and not thinking too far ahead of themselves. Now, the time they've been preparing for with small steps has come. It's important that South Africa don't change their approach too drastically, since it has served them so well. "We have to just carry on the way we have," Smith said "We've met each challenge as it comes." #p#The Bangladesh challenge was met with the brute force that Smith said the team used to be about and the street smartness that he said they'd gathered in the last few years about playing sub-continent sides. South Africa are changing tactics and strategies with each game, not for the sake of it, but to be able to directly challenge the opposition. That's why Smith is not concerned about who they meet in the next round. "I've said before that if you are to win this tournament, you have to beat whoever you play, so we are not thinking about it."
39	507105	Bangladesh v South Africa, Group B, World Cup 2011, Mirpur	The great Bangla tragedy	Firdose Moonda in Mirpur	March 19, 2011	There were always signs that Bangladesh's last act was going to be a horror show, and it ended up being so when their players forget their lines Associated Press Enlarge Related Links Report : Abject Bangladesh surrender meekly Analysis : Everything was a weakness for Bangladesh Matches: Bangladesh v South Africa at Dhaka Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Bangladesh | South Africa #p#Shakespeare would have been proud of this tragedy. There was unfulfilled ambition, revenge, inner turmoil and death, not of anyone, but of a dream. #p#At the end, the Bangladesh vision lay lifeless on the Shere Bangla field. The supporters had abandoned them, some leaving when the early dents were made in the batting line-up and the rest jumping ship near the end. The play wasn't worth watching anymore and they didn't care what happened to the hero Shakib Al Hasan. He was the protagonist and we all know what happens to them in Shakespeare's scripts. #p#When the curtain opened, the scene that rolled out had the makings of a horror show. The Bangladesh fast bowlers were feeding Hashim Amla and Graeme Smith some juicy deliveries. Full tosses, balls pitched on leg stump, short and wide stuff, and there was no stopping the opening pair. Bangladesh allowed Smith, who had been in scratchy form in the tournament, to plant some roots and settle. They gave Amla the stage to continue growing his stature as one of the batsmen of the tournament, and Bangladesh's woes may have grown even more had they been allowed to continue. #p#There was a twist in the plot, though. Abdur Razzak, Naeem Islam, Mahmudullah and Shakib did what they did to South Africa in the 2007 World Cup in Guyana - tied them up. Although they were not running the same kind of strangling circles as they did on that day, they still managed to pull the run-rate back enough for 250 to look like a reasonable amount of runs to restrict South Africa to. #p#Of course, the South Africa batsmen were part of the play too and they had some acting to do themselves. Jacques Kallis brought up his half-century almost unnoticed, and Faf du Plessis was able to craft his character for the third time in this World Cup. du Plessis has been able to show the maturity that many from his domestic franchise knew he had all along, against India, Ireland and again today. South Africa's middle order, still relatively untested, may need a few more of these situations before they start to be considered as threatening as the bowling attack, but du Plessis will be central to that. #p#The Bangladesh bowlers would have never seen him before and it showed. They bowled to him as South Africa bowled to Mohammad Ashraful in Guyana in that World Cup - as though he was too unknown a quantity for them to have done much homework on. They batted in the same fashion against Lonwabo Tsotsobe, although they had seen him on during South Africa's A tour early last year. #p#What really happened is that Bangladesh hadn't rehearsed their lines properly, hadn't put enough research into the South Africa players; maybe because they didn't expect them to field the side that they ended up fielding. Once Tsotsobe had set them back significantly, the lines that they were struggling to remember were gone. #p#There was no recovery. The fans seemed to know that before anyone else and that may have been why they started pouring out. Shakib tried to prompt a comeback, that gentle reminder of how things should be, and he had four beautiful boundaries, but his performance alone would never be enough. Smith has said that South Africa were on no revenge mission; but the way they unleashed the pain on Bangladesh told a different story. It meant that there was no room for any of the ambition Bangladesh had harboured to peep through. #p#This game alone may not have been the vehicle to fulfill Bangladesh's dream but because of the results of the past few weeks - the loss to West Indies and then the West Indies loss to England - everything eventually hung on beating South Africa. Maybe the end wasn't too painful because beating the team that has looked strongest in this tournament would be a tough ask. It may have made the final act easier to swallow. #p#Shakib was too traumatised to be able to think about the way forward, but Smith had a suggestion, although it is not positive. He thinks there that there is still a long way to go before the script can be revised. "The challenge will be to create consistency," he said. '"They need to start learning to win." It may be as difficult as learning their lines but they've got four years to practise.
40	506830	Australia v Pakistan, Group A, World cup 2011, Colombo	Pakistan keep focus amid Shoaib retirement	Osman Samiuddin in Colombo	March 18, 2011	Shahid Afridi was non-committal about whether Shoaib Akhtar would play against Australia AFP Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: Shahid Afridi | Shoaib Akhtar Matches: Australia v Pakistan at Colombo (RPS) Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Pakistan #p#Even in his departure - perhaps especially in it - Shoaib Akhtar can't help but be the centre of attention. Before Thursday, Pakistan's game against Australia was all about Pakistan's game against Australia: who will top the group, will Pakistan change their opening partnership, will they be able to handle Australia's pace, will history play a role in Pakistan breaking Australia's unbeaten streak, given that they remain the last side to beat them in a World Cup match (at Headingley in the previous century, 1999)? #p#All this remains relevant but also irrelevant because the answer most people want is whether or not Shoaib will get a chance to play another game in this tournament. He was dropped - not rested - for the game against Zimbabwe and the concerns about his fitness, retirement or not, remain. Shahid Afridi rarely reveals his hand publicly and he seemed in a particular hurry today, so the question remained, essentially, unanswered. #p#On fitness, on a guarantee of ten overs and younger legs in the field, Wahab Riaz retains his place in the XI from the last game. On emotion - and the management is not particularly keen to let that get in the way - and the believable prospect of a game-changing over or two, Shoaib might sneak in. If Afridi was leaning anywhere between ruling him in and ruling him out, it appeared to be towards the latter. Maybe: "As for future games, let's look at the combination. If he is needed we will definitely use him," was all he would say. #p#The announcement dominated proceedings. Was this the right time for him to go? "I don't think it is bad timing. Maybe he could have decided after the World Cup but it's up to him," Afridi replied, still non-committal. Was there any friction behind the decision? "I don't think so. He never said anything about being upset or anything. I think he is enjoying himself if he is playing or even if he isn't playing." Was it a good decision? "I think he took the right decision. It was his own decision. Because of his bowling Pakistan won quite a few matches. He has set a good example because in Pakistan normally the selector kicks you out, you don't leave yourself." #p#In truth, Afridi is right to be blasé about the matter. He, and Pakistan's campaign, cannot be distracted by this, though chances are he is not anyway. He is not a man to dwell on matters too much. And there are other issues of personnel to be resolved, prime among them Ahmed Shehzad. He has been backed unconditionally through five games, which have fetched 51 runs, and worse, some careless dismissals. Do they give him one more game, in the hope he might do something, or should they show some ruthlessness and dump him now? #p#"Maybe we'll do some changing in the opening," was Afridi's typically concise response. They at least have options now. Asad Shafiq's assured World Cup debut against Zimbabwe - "He did well so he should be in shouldn't he? Definitely he will play next game" - means he remains in the XI. Kamran Akmal can thus resume a promising opening partnership with Mohammad Hafeez - "We can [use Kamran as opener], definitely we can do it" - and Umar Akmal is fit and available for selection again. #p#Without changing the bent or balance of the XI, Pakistan can make a key personnel change, which is precisely the situation they want to be in. And it leaves them with three spinning options as well. They don't want, as Afridi said, to be experimenting right now. #p#All that leaves the minor matter of Australia, a team untested and not as ominous as it once was, but a team nonetheless calibrated simply and clearly to win matches. Beat them and maybe top the group, potentially drawing a less difficult quarter-final. Lose and face the top teams from the other group. Ultimately, the best sides will have to be beaten at some stage or another. #p#"They are a very professional side and they know how to use these conditions as well. They are very strong mentally and physically," Afridi said. "But we know our strength as well, we know how to tackle and deal with these guys, so we are well-prepared. We've made some plans against them and you will see tomorrow in the game we will do something new."
40	506884	Australia v Pakistan, Group A, World Cup 2011, Colombo	Ponting eager for Pakistan test	Brydon Coverdale in Colombo	March 18, 2011	The Pakistan game, Ricky Ponting has said, will give Australia a better indication of where they stand Associated Press Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: Ricky Ponting Matches: Australia v Pakistan at Colombo (RPS) Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Australia #p#A delayed flight, a midnight arrival at their hotel in Colombo and one afternoon training session on Friday might seem like a rushed preparation for Australia's match against Pakistan on Saturday. In fact, their build-up has been anything but hurried. Ricky Ponting's men have spent more than a month travelling around India and Sri Lanka, but in between rounds of golf and elephant rides, they've hardly got out of second gear on the field. #p#So far, they haven't needed to, and they enter Saturday's game unbeaten and with first place in Group A there for the taking. Wins over Zimbabwe and a lacklustre New Zealand were followed a fortnight later by victories against Kenya and Canada. At times their opponents have surprised them with fireworks but overall it has been a slow burn, dampened by the wash-out against Sri Lanka, which was poised to be their first major challenge. #p#Meanwhile, Pakistan have spent a month in Sri Lanka, stumbling once when Ross Taylor took a liking to the short boundaries in Pallekele, but otherwise steering themselves through to the quarter-finals with relative comfort, including a win over the home team. All that this match will determine is who Pakistan and Australia face in their first knockout game, and whether they play it in Colombo, Dhaka or Ahmedabad. But it will also give Ponting an indication of where his men sit. #p#"We really do start to feel that the tournament is kicking off now," Ponting said. "We've had our games along the way and the other big game we had in our pool matches was the game against Sri Lanka, which was washed out, unfortunately. We've been really excited about playing this game against Pakistan for quite a while. #p#"During those longer breaks, we've trained exceptionally hard and trained very, very well. We just haven't had the continuity we would have liked with our games. But we got a couple of good results in Bangalore last week. At this stage we're the only undefeated team in the tournament, which is nice for us, but I think we'll get a better feel tomorrow at the end of the game for just where we're at and how well we're placed in this World Cup." #p#The Australians will fancy their attack against Pakistan, who have been bowled out for 184 by Canada and 192 by New Zealand in their past three games. But the big challenge will be overcoming a Pakistan bowling group led by Umar Gul, with his swinging yorkers, and the captain Shahid Afridi, who is the leading wicket-taker in the tournament. #p#The last time the teams met in an ODI, Afridi stuck the ball in his mouth. This time, he'll be looking for bite off the pitch and at the Premadasa, where even Steven Smith was turning the ball sharply before the rain came against Sri Lanka, Afridi could be a handful. #p#"He has been the standout bowler, wickets-wise, in the tournament so far," Ponting said. "He tends to control the middle of their bowling innings particularly well. He doesn't go for a lot of runs, either, which is probably the main reason he's taken the amount of wickets that he has. He builds up pressure, and if he builds up pressure from his end you can guarantee that the guy at the other end is more likely to strike and take wickets as well. That was one of the big things we spoke about this morning, making sure we play him well. #p#"They've got a number of match-winning players in their team. If you look through their better-performed player through the tournament so far, you'd look at Afridi and Gul as the two guys who have been their standout players. We know we're going to have to play those guys well tomorrow if we want to win the game. They're a dangerous side. They proved that last time they played Sri Lanka here at this venue, how good a side they can be." #p#Pakistan were also the last team to beat Australia in a World Cup match, at Headingley in 1999, and Ponting's men have now extended their streak to 34 games without a loss. Making it 35 will be their toughest challenge so far in this tournament, but after a month in second gear, they'll be pleased to finally put the foot down.
40	506894	Australia v Pakistan, World Cup 2011, Group A, Colombo	Australia want to get serious	The Preview by Andrew McGlashan	March 18, 2011	#p#Match Facts March 19, Colombo Start time 14.30 (0900 GMT) #p#Ricky Ponting has cut a frustrated figure in Australia's recent matches AFP Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: Kamran Akmal | Ricky Ponting | Shoaib Akhtar | Umar Akmal Matches: Australia v Pakistan at Colombo (RPS) Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Australia | Pakistan #p#The Big Picture #p#It's all about jostling for position in Group A with both Australia and Pakistan still eyeing a top-of-the-table finish and, potentially, a slightly easier quarter-final, although that is a debatable point given the form of teams on in the opposite group. These two teams have served up some classic confrontations in their time and Pakistan were the last side to beat Ricky Ponting's team at a World Cup - way back on May 23, 1999. #p#Australia remain the only unbeaten team in this edition having overcome Kenya and Canada in Bangalore, but not without a few unconvincing moments with bat and ball. The sight of Ponting losing his cool is a clear sign that he is far from happy with how his team are currently shaping up in what has been a odd tournament for them. Their biggest match, against Sri Lanka, was washed out and the rest have been easy - perhaps too much so. #p#For the sake of fine-tuning before the quarter-finals Australia need to be pushed. That, though, depends on which Pakistan turn up. They aren't really a side motivated by group positions with their progression safely assured. Still, Australia's bowlers know they'll need to be better than over the last week against a talented, if unpredictable, Pakistan batting line-up. The likes of Ponting, Cameron White and Steven Smith need some time in the middle, too. #p#Pakistan's bowling attack should provide a proper test even if Shoaib Akhtar doesn't play. Shahid Afridi is having a memorable tournament with the ball and there are plenty of other spin options that could trouble Australia. However, don't be surprised if their unbeaten World Cup record is extended for at least another week. #p#Form guide (completed matches, most recent first) Australia WWWWW Pakistan WLWWW #p#Watch out for... #p#Ricky Ponting is living up to the 'captain grumpy' tag at the moment following is angry display when he almost collided with Smith when taking a catch against Canada. He later admitted it didn't look good, but his mood was hardly improved when he pulled to square leg for 7 to continue a lean trot. His damaged little finger is clearly causing him problems, especially in the field, although Ponting will be desperate not to give an inch. However, it's been a long time since he made a telling contribution, and that pressure will start to tell at some point. #p#Umar Akmal is a tempestuous youngster who only knows one way to play: attack. He missed the last game with an ankle niggle but should be fit to take on Australia. His confrontation with the quicks will be worth viewing and he won't let the spinners settle. If Umar comes off he is fantastic to watch, but he's also equally likely to combust quickly. Either way, it won't be dull viewing. #p#Team news #p#Australia are likely to resist the temptation to give any of their squad players a came ahead of the knockout stage. John Hastings is the spare bowling option should they decide to rest a quick but he may have to wait on the sidelines. #p#Australia (probable) 1 Shane Watson, 2 Brad Haddin (wk), 3 Ricky Ponting (capt), 4 Michael Clarke, 5 Cameron White, 6 Michael Hussey, 7 Steven Smith, 8 Mitchell Johnson, 9 Brett Lee, 10 Jason Krejza, 11 Shaun Tait #p#Pakistan have a number of options and no one is quite sure which route they'll take. However, it seems likely that Ahmed Shehzad's poor form will cost him his place with Kamran Akmal being moved up to open alongside Mohammad Hafeez. Umar Akmal is fit again and then there's the decision between the steadiness of Wahab Riaz and the match-changing potential of Shoaib Akhtar. #p#Pakistan (possible) 1 Mohammad Hafeez, 2 Kamran Akmal (wk), 3 Asad Shafiq, 4 Younis Khan, 5 Misbah-ul-Haq, 6 Umar Akmal, 7 Shahid Afridi (capt), 8 Abdul Razzaq, 9 Umar Gul, 10 Abdur Rehman, 11 Wahab Riaz #p#Pitch and conditions #p#The bowlers have enjoyed some success at Colombo so far and there was significant turn on offer before rain arrived during the Sri Lanka-Australia match. Rain has played its part in Sri Lanka, though, and there is a chance of showers impacting the match. Australia, especially, will hope for an uninterrupted contest. #p#Stats and trivia #p#The last World Cup meeting between these two was early in the 2003 tournament when Australia won by 82 runs #p#Cameron White needs three runs to reach 2000 in ODIs #p#Australia took the bilateral series against Pakistan at home last year 5-0 #p#Quotes #p#"At this stage we're the only undefeated team in the tournament, which is nice for us, but I think we'll get a better feel tomorrow at the end of the game for just where we're at and how well we're placed in this World Cup." Ricky Ponting on his side's form in the tournament #p#"We've made some plans against them and you will see tomorrow in the game we will do something new." Shahid Afridi suggests there might be a few surprises from his side
40	506913	Australia v Pakistan, Group A, World cup 2011, Colombo	Hilditch wants more impact from Tait	Brydon Coverdale in Colombo	March 18, 2011	Shaun Tait should have more impact in the early and middle overs according to Australia' chairman of selectors Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: Jason Krejza | Shaun Tait Matches: Australia v Pakistan at Colombo (RPS) Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Australia #p#The man who signed off on Australia's aggressive World Cup attack believes Shaun Tait needs to have more impact if Australia are to win a fourth consecutive title. The chairman of selectors, Andrew Hilditch, also said that if Ricky Ponting can steer his side to another world triumph, it would rate as more satisfying than the previous three, which were achieved with great players such as Glenn McGrath and Adam Gilchrist. #p#Tait was a key part of the 2007 campaign, when he finished joint second on the tournament wicket tally with 23 at 20.30, and his speed and hostility provided the perfect balance against the control of McGrath and Nathan Bracken. This time, Australia have gone with a trio of seriously quick bowlers, and while Tait is their leading wicket taker, he has also at times been slapped around the ground by moderate batsmen. #p#As the selector on duty, Hilditch will be watching at the Premadasa on Saturday when Tait, Brett Lee and Mitchell Johnson try to run through Pakistan, their last chance to hone their approach before the quarter-finals. Hilditch said he was thrilled with the way Lee had returned from his serious elbow injury, but he wanted more from Tait as the knockout stage of the tournament rapidly approaches. #p#"I'm really happy with how Brett is going," Hilditch said. "I think it's a great credit to him, what he's done at his age and with the injuries he has had. He has come back just brilliantly. He's bowling really well. Mitchell Johnson has been really good. I think Taity has got to improve a little bit. He's going to have to impact with the new ball and then impact in the middle overs. I think the test on how that's going to work is going to be in the next few games." #p#The other men who will be important for Australia in the middle overs are the spinners, Jason Krejza and Steven Smith, who have not yet had a major impact on the tour. Against Pakistan, Hilditch will be keeping a close eye on Krejza, who, having made his name in the longer form of the game, was thrust into the one-day setup due to injuries to Nathan Hauritz and Xavier Doherty. #p#"It's a big test for Jason tomorrow on what could be a bit of a turning track," Hilditch said. "He's bowling pretty well. It's a steep learning curve, coming from playing Tasmanian cricket to playing against the best players in the world, but I think he's adjusting pretty well and it will be interesting to see how he goes tomorrow." #p#Australia are chasing their 35th consecutive World Cup match without a defeat, which stretches back to the 1999 tournament, the first of their three straight titles. As a selector since 1996, Hilditch has been involved in choosing all the successful squads, and he said that while 2007 was "the best campaign I've ever seen", it would be overtaken if Ponting lifts the trophy on April 2. #p#"If we manage to pull this off, I think it would be even better than 2007, because we've lost quite a few players since 2007. We had already lost quite a few players between 2003 and 2007. People forget that before 2007, we lost to England in the one-day series, we lost to New Zealand in the one-day series. We were actually going in looking like significant underdogs in 2007, and then we played the way we did. #p#"I think this is totally different. We've lost virtually most of the side since that time, and the fact that we've continued on the way we have done is great. This will be a massive challenge in these conditions. They're obviously not our ideal conditions and with this side, a fairly new side, it would be a great effort."

An impressive display in the field laid the foundations as the reigning champions were bundled out for 176 on a difficult surface, their lowest total in a World Cup since 1992, and despite a mighty effort from Brett Lee Pakistan were guided home by Umar Akmal and Abdul Razzaq. #p#Despite not having either team's progression at stake, the final group positions determine quarter-final opposition while momentum is also a factor. Both teams were hyped for the contest, and it came to an early head when Umar and Brad Haddin almost came to blows in the field. Australia were desperate not to relinquish a proud record dating back to May 23, 1999. #p#After their batting subsided with 20 balls unused, Australia's only chance was to bowl Pakistan out, but in the event it required Lee himself to do most of the damage. He removed both openers in a fiery new-ball burst before returning to claim Younis Khan and Misbah-ul-Haq with consecutive deliveries in 23rd over, leaving Pakistan wobbling on 98 for 4. #p#Smart stats Australia's defeat ends a 34-match World Cup streak without a loss. During this period, which started on May 27, 1999, they won 32 matches, while one was tied and one was a no-result. The scoring patterns of the two teams were distinctly different in this match: Australia took 89 singles, 13 twos, and struck ten fours; Pakistan took 59 singles, eight twos, but struck 21 fours, more than twice the number that Australia managed. Since September 2010, Shahid Afridi has been dismissed 21 times in 341 balls, at an average of 16.24 balls per dismissal. Brett Lee's figures of 4 for 28 are his best against Pakistan. In 21 ODIs against them, he has taken 38 wickets at 23.18. In his last 12 ODI innings, Ricky Ponting has scored 289 runs at an average of 24.08, with only one half-century. #p#However, support for Lee was too late in coming which didn't leave enough runs for Australia to play with. Mitchell Johnson had Asad Shafiq taken at slip off the glove for a composed 46 and Shahid Afridi brainlessly carved to long-on against Jason Krejza. Surprisingly, Lee wasn't immediately recalled with 34 runs still needed and by the time he came back the target was down to 10. Umar played one of his most composed innings yet, and Razzaq finished the chase with consecutive boundaries. #p#Lee could easily have removed Kamran Akmal in the first over of Pakistan's reply, while in his second over he squared up Mohammad Hafeez and made good ground to take the return catch. With attacking fields set by Ricky Ponting, further boundaries were notched up by Kamran and Shafiq, who had to battle some pain after twisting his ankle, but Lee kept his side in the match singlehandedly. #p#After being carved over the covers he thundered a rapid delivery into Kamran's pads and this time he was given out by Marais Erasmus with the review unable to save him. However, Ponting knew he had to save some of Lee for later and his spell ended after five overs which released the pressure on Pakistan. #p#Shafiq, who showed his composure against Zimbabwe in his first World Cup outing, played another mature hand knowing that the required rate was always in hand. Both he and Younis had a few nervous moments - with the pair edging through a vacant slip cordon - but together they took the requirement below 100. Eventually, though, Younis flashed once too often outside off and gave a simple catch to Brad Haddin, and from the very next ball, the match was back in the balance when Misbah, the other half of Pakistan's experienced middle order, hung his bat out at a Lee outswinger. #p#Umar wasn't going to fiddle his way towards the target and drilled his fifth ball through the covers, but to his immense credit he throttled back to play a very mature hand. He picked the right moments to attack, including a six off Krejza, and didn't panic after Lee's rapid inroads. It helped that he had the experience of Razzaq at the end to see them across the line. #p#Australia have been saying how they wanted a test after easing through most of the group stage but the batting wasn't up to it on a difficult surface that offered spin and a touch of uneven bounce. Two batsmen desperate for a substantial innings, Ponting (19) and Cameron White (8), both struggled leaving the lower order exposed to an attack that had all the bases covered on a surface offering spin and reverse swing. #p#Pakistan had an early scare when Gul pulled up at the start of his second over with a knee problem and needed attention from the physio. Whatever treatment was provided worked wonders because he produced a lovely nip-backer to beat Shane Watson's ambitious drive. Ponting has been scratchy during the tournament and was again unconvincing with his first boundary came from a fortunate top-edge after he was comprehensively beaten by a Wahab Riaz bouncer. #p#Not for the first time spin brought his downfall when he tried to cut Hafeez, who produced a superb 10-over spell for 26, and got a thick edge that Kamran did well to take in the webbing of his right glove. However, it was originally given not out and the DRS was needed to overturn the decision in Pakistan's favour. Meanwhile, as the players waited for the TV umpire, there was an altercation between Haddin and the Pakistanis. #p#Haddin has been consistent during the tournament without reaching the three-figure score the top order needs and he couldn't convert here when he pushed at a delivery from Wahab Riaz. Misbah missed an opportunity to run out Michael Clarke but made no mistake when his next chance came around when his throw to Kamran found White short after a laboured stay. #p#In Clarke and Michael Hussey, Australia had two of their in-form players together but even they found scoring tough as Afridi mixed up his bowling options. Razzaq was held back until the 35th over and made an immediate impression when Clarke missed an ugly heave against a well-disguised off-cutter which trimmed the off bail. #p#Hussey couldn't perform a rescue-act, either, when he chipped a simple catch to midwicket and the innings was coming off the rails as Razzaq produced a nippy delivery to find Johnson's outside edge. It left the tail to cope with Gul and Afridi which proved too much, but Australia weren't many short of a matchwinning total. The quarters and semi-final will be fascinating viewing if the pitches are anything like this surface. #p#Match Timeline

Matches: Australia v Pakistan at Colombo (RPS) Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Australia | Pakistan Gallery: Pakistan end Australia's World Cup run #p#Referral of the day Pakistan haven't been too hot in their usage of the DRS in this World Cup, their batsmen and bowlers both too eager to go upstairs to challenge decisions that, to the naked eye, have mostly looked right in the first place. But when Ricky Ponting edged Mohammad Hafeez - and it was so huge, it nearly came off the face of the bat - and Marais Erasmus turned it down, they asked for it straight away. They'd already wasted one early in the innings but as replays confirmed, the edge was so massive Kamran Akmal did remarkably well to hold on to it. Perhaps Akmal holding on to an actual edge was what Erasmus couldn't believe? We're not sure what Ponting was hoping to achieve by hanging around but this is surely why the DRS exists. #p#Scrap of the day Bragging rights and a favourable quarter-final draw were the only incentives in a game of two sides already assured knock-out spots. It could've been a low-tension stroll through the Premadasa but low intensity is not something associated with these two sides. Pakistan announced their intent by not giving into emotion and keeping Shoaib Akhtar out. Through the day there was chatter among opponents, though Umar Akmal and Brad Haddin took it to another level with their feisty tete-a-tete after the Ricky Ponting referral. Words were exchanged - not nice ones - and fingers pointed, before Shahid Afridi and Younis Khan tried to calm things down. They didn't and the situation seemed to get worse with what appeared to be a little shove of Younis by Haddin. Ah, dead group games  #p#Double of the day The result was drifting towards foregone-conclusion territory with Pakistan needing 79 more runs with eight wickets in hand, when Brett Lee gave the game some spark. Lee had removed both the openers in his first spell, and as soon as he came back for his second, he struck a double blow. Younis Khan edged behind from the fourth ball of Lee's second spell and the next delivery Misbah-ul-Haq also nicked through to Brad Haddin. It was the lift the Australians needed, but unfortunately for Lee, his was proving to be a solo effort. #p#Soccer of the day Lee did some fine work with the ball in this match, but this was not his best moment. He dug the ball in to Umar Akmal, who kept it out, though not without a certain awkwardness, and in his follow-through Lee looked set to collect the ball. Instead, he decided to kick it off the ground towards the wicketkeeper - the only problem being that it skewed off the side of his boot and ran away towards fine leg for an overthrow. Or, more correctly, an overkick. Innings Dot balls 4s 6s PP1 PP2 PP3 Last 10 overs NB/Wides Australia 173 10 1 36/1 31/0 3/2 28/3 0/10 Pakistan 159 21 1 45/2 17/0 N/A 9/0 0/4
40	507156	Australia v Pakistan, Group A, World Cup 2011, Colombo	A hard call on Ponting's one-day future	Brydon Coverdale at the R Premadasa Stadium	March 19, 2011	Ricky Ponting had only made 19 when he edged one behind to Kamran Akmal at the Premadasa AFP Enlarge Related Links News : Team-mates back Ponting on captaincy Analysis : After the streak, Australia can get on with business Report : Pakistan end Australia's run to finish top Players/Officials: Ricky Ponting Matches: Australia v Pakistan at Colombo (RPS) Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Australia #p#"I'm going. I have to keep playing. I've missed enough cricket the last couple of years." Those were the words of Ricky Ponting earlier this week, when asked if he would be part of Australia's one-day tour of Bangladesh immediately after the World Cup. #p#Three days later, the chairman of selectors, Andrew Hilditch, had this to say: "Some players get to go on their own terms at the right times and some don't. I suppose if you're determined to play forever then at some stage a selector is going to make the hard call." #p#Hilditch went on to praise Ponting's energy and fitness, and said that if any man was capable of playing for a long time, it was the Australia captain. There was no hint that his panel would be making a "hard call" any time soon. But there is nothing to be gained from Ponting, who is now 36, extending his one-day career beyond this World Cup. #p#If he can guide the Australians to a fourth consecutive title, it would be his greatest captaincy achievement. It would also be the perfect time to fold away the coloured clothing for good. If not - and they have much work to do after their 34-match streak without a World Cup loss ended against Pakistan in Colombo - it would still be the right time to start thinking about the next era of Australia's one-day team. #p#Michael Clarke has proven himself a thoughtful and adventurous captain, and handing him control of the one-day team would be a positive move. It would also create space to give more exposure to young batsmen like Callum Ferguson and Aaron Finch, who could be important parts of Australia's one-day future. And what else can Ponting, a potentially four-time World Cup winner, hope to achieve in one-day cricket? #p#Maybe he will go on in Tests; the temptation of another challenging summer against India on the horizon, and visions of one final Ashes tour in 2013 still flickering in his mind. However, by the time the 2015 World Cup comes around, he'll be 40, and will be on the golf course working on his formidable handicap. #p#Of course, Ponting has been a giant of limited-overs cricket - a tally of 13,184 runs speaks for itself, and his unbeaten 140 in the 2003 World Cup final victory over India is one of the great one-day innings. But right now, he is stuck in the leanest patch of his international career, which continued on Saturday, when he edged behind as he tried to cut against the spin of Mohammad Hafeez. #p#Since he started at the Academy as a 16-year-old, batting has never appeared difficult for Ponting. It certainly seems to be getting harder. On Saturday at the Premadasa, he hustled to the crease with purpose, rehearsing the swing of his bat as he walked, like a boxer punching the air. #p#He was careful, and took eight balls to get off the mark. But he was also on the front foot, as is his style when he wishes to make a statement, and when he tried his first hook he was beaten by the bounce of Wahab Riaz, and the top edge flew high over the wicketkeeper's head to the boundary. #p#The shot that was once Ponting's trademark has become one of his major weaknesses, his judgment not what it was in his youth. In Bangalore on Wednesday, he was surprised by the pace of Canada's Henry Osinde, and lobbed a catch when he tried to pull. #p#Across all formats, Ponting has played 37 innings since he last made a hundred, against West Indies in an ODI in February last year. The only time he has gone longer without an international triple-figure score was a 43-innings stretch, starting in December 2003. #p#But even then, during his barren period he still found ways to contribute, and averaged 40.20 across all formats. Now, since his last century, he has averaged 28.27. It is possible to return stronger from such a drought as a young man, but as an ageing player it is much more challenging. #p#"I'm trying as hard as ever and I feel like I'm seeing the ball as good as ever," Ponting said after making 19 against Pakistan. "If I keep doing the right things, hopefully that big score will come for me. It's been a few games now and I certainly haven't scored the runs I would have liked to have scored in the World Cup so far, but the big games are coming up and hopefully I get some in the quarter-final." #p#If Ponting wishes to play on after the finals, he would be better off narrowing his focus to Test cricket, and sliding down to No. 5 or 6. It is not a dishonourable move for a captain. Allan Border ended his career down the order, and nobody thought less of him. Steve Waugh hardly ever batted above No. 5. #p#But Australia don't play any more Tests until August, so that is a debate for another day. For now, it's Ponting's one-day future that needs to be considered. And if he is planning to continue after the World Cup, the selectors might need to make that hard call.
40	507159	Australia v Pakistan, Group A, World Cup 2011, Colombo	After the streak, Australia can get on with business	Brydon Coverdale at the R Premadasa Stadium	March 19, 2011	#p#Not even Muhammad Ali boasted an unbeaten streak this great. It has taken 34 matches, but Australia have finally been defeated in a World Cup game for the first time since 1999. In that time, three titles were won, 15 different opponents were vanquished and 34 players were used to keep the sequence alive. #p#Nobody really expected it to last this long, and now that it has ended, Australia can go back to being just any other team in the tournament. That's no bad thing. Expectations are lowered, pressure is lifted and any lingering aura that surrounded the team will fade. #p#The captain, Ricky Ponting, never likes to lose but was pleased the streak finished in the group stage rather than the upcoming knockouts. And after a month on the subcontinent with barely a threat from any of their previous opponents, he hopes the loss to Pakistan will help his side as the business end of the tournament approaches. #p#"To be honest, I don't think the loss will hurt us at all," Ponting said. "I know for a fact the guys haven't been thinking about the winning streak at all because it hasn't been mentioned around our group or our change-rooms or meetings or anything. I think the fact that we've played a good Pakistan team and we've come up short will get all the guys thinking just exactly what they need to be thinking about and the way they need to play to win World Cup games. #p#"We've found ourselves in some tough situations today and we weren't good enough to get out of them. We have to learn from that, and we have to learn from that quickly, because if we play India in Ahmedabad, then you can guarantee the same situations are going to pop up again, and we'll have to handle them a whole lot better than we did today [Saturday]." #p#Brett Lee tried his best to pull Australia back, but he needs his team-mates to fire going forward Getty Images Enlarge #p#Ponting was one of only two men playing in the match who was also part of the last World Cup game Australia had lost. That was also a defeat at the hands of Pakistan, whose only remaining player from that 1999 line-up was Abdul Razzaq. #p#Shoaib Akhtar was also part of that side, but was overlooked for this game. As it turned out, Pakistan barely missed him. From the spin of Abdur Rehman, who opened the bowling, to the excellent swing bowling of Umar Gul, to the miserly offbreaks of Mohammad Hafeez, to the nagging seamers of Razzaq, Australia struggled against all of Pakistan's bowlers. #p#"We weren't able to rotate the strike anywhere near well enough off [Hafeez]," Ponting said. "He was the one who put the brakes on the most. When you've got a guy who's doing that at one end it does build up pressure, and generally when you build up pressure in one-day cricket is when teams can have batting collapses like we did today. #p#"You've got to give them credit for the way they bowled. We'll certainly learn from the experience today about what you have to do to play spin bowling well and how to rotate the strike a bit better." #p#Australia lost their last six wickets for 42 runs, and it left their bowlers with little to defend. Brett Lee did his best to drag Australia bag into the contest with two new-ball wickets and a pair in consecutive deliveries in his second spell, but he had little support. #p#That's one thing Australia will need to rectify before their quarter-final, which will be against India in Ahmedabad, unless West Indies upset India on Sunday. If that is the case, Australia would most likely head to Dhaka to take on West Indies. #p#Wherever they end up, they will be starting afresh after their first loss in 34 games. They'll settle for a three-match winning streak to end the tournament.
40	507162	Australia v Pakistan, Group A, World Cup 2011, Colombo	A game to savour and forget	Osman Samiuddin at the R Premadasa Stadium	March 19, 2011	Asad Shafiq has shown in two games in a row that he can play responsibly at No. 3 Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Report : Pakistan end Australia's run to finish top Players/Officials: Waqar Younis Matches: Australia v Pakistan at Colombo (RPS) Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Pakistan #p#What a strange kind of win this is for Pakistan. It is an impressive one; there should be no mistaking that. The first team to beat Australia in a World Cup in 35 games and 12 years was always going to have to play a big game to do it. To top the group, with just one loss, is something very few would have predicted before the tournament began. #p#And to draw, potentially, the weakest of the qualifiers from Group B - that is just a numerical reality in this most-open tournament, not a comment on whichever side it eventually is - means Pakistan could have asked for nothing more. Yet, as much as the win should mean, it might mean nothing at all by the next game. It is that kind of an in between triumph. #p#From the evidence of six games, from the evidence of this win, there is enough to suggest that Shahid Afridi's pre-tournament target of a semi-final spot is eminently achievable. It was before the tournament began as well, but deeds are achieved on the field, not on paper. #p#Pakistan's bowling won them this game. It is what always wins them games and what always makes them a contender. It is why they don't go the way of West Indies or New Zealand, because they always have an attack that can do a job; bowl sides out in Tests, defend targets in ODIs. #p#Umar Gul again led the way and he is increasingly becoming a pivotal figure in the campaign. Waqar Younis' presence as coach is no coincidence, as it wasn't when Gul went through an earlier phase of success in 2006, with Waqar as bowling coach at the time. "He's improving day by day," Waqar said, with a hint of pride. "He's found his right length and he's not only bowling straight but with some pace. He's attacking areas where it's hard to hit, so he's getting better and better, which is great for the team." #p#There was no let-up behind him. Abdur Rehman used defence smartly as attack; Wahab Riaz recovered after an iffy start and even Abdul Razzaq clocked in. Mohammad Hafeez's batting has hit a dip again, but his bowling has assumed greater importance and his spell at the Premadasa was the one that really took the life out of Australia's innings. #p#It would have been nothing without a fielding display about as sharp as any Pakistan has put together under Afridi and Waqar. Hafeez was operating a kind of Sri Lanka-like choke, darting them in but turning them also, forcing batsmen to play to short midwicket - a crucial position in any strangle - who would swoop in, stop the single and throw back to Hafeez for it to be repeated all over again, on loop. #p#Runs and boundaries were given up only grudgingly. There were direct hits, a run-out and generally the impression that stealing singles within the circle or doubles out to big boundaries was a risk. "It's going to get better," Waqar said. "It makes a difference when you are playing against a bigger team and we still need to improve. But definitely today was a much better performance. We took our catches and we stopped boundaries. We did our job so we must give credit to the fielding." #p#The batting has more promise than before, though it remains prone to jitters. The surface wasn't the easiest and Australia's quicks will test most sides, but Pakistan will take particular delight in their two youngest batsmen taking them home. It is the blend in their batting through the middle that is their strength. There is experience in Younis Khan and Misbah-ul-Haq and freshness in Asad Shafiq and Umar Akmal. Younis and Misbah set up the Sri Lanka win, Shafiq and Umar this one. #p#Umar's hand was worthy of the Man-of-the-Match award, for he counterpunched just when Pakistan could have been knocked out, and he finished the game. But Shafiq's 46, like the unbeaten 78 against Zimbabwe last week, caught the eye for its quiet sense and method, always full of intent but not averse to caution. #p#Waqar didn't hold back in his praise. "He's becoming more and more mature every day, not only this series but even if you go back to the New Zealand series where he played some really good knocks. He's very steady, not a big hitter, he manoeuvres the ball here and there, picks up the odd boundary. At No. 3, he's done a superb job in the last match [against Zimbabwe] and he's done a job today [Saturday] as well." #p#It is a big win, "a real achievement," concluded Waqar. But every win from now will, unavoidably, be bigger. They will enjoy it now, Waqar said, before waiting on the permutations of who they play. They will also have to "forget it." It's not often Pakistan have been able to say that of a win against Australia recently, which tells, if you think about it, its own story of what this team has done and could yet do.
41	507075	Kenya v Zimbabwe, Group A, World Cup 2011, Kolkata,	Kenya's last chance for victory	The Preview by Sriram Veera	March 19, 2011	#p#Match Facts March 20, Kolkata Start time 0930 hours (0400 GMT) #p#Will Steve Tikolo script himself a perfect farewell? Thota Sreenivas Enlarge Related Links Matches: Kenya v Zimbabwe at Kolkata Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Kenya | Zimbabwe #p#The Big Picture Kenya v Zimbabwe is a meaningless contest between two teams with one victory between them in this World Cup, so why should anyone watch it? Well, if you are a Kenyan fan, this is a must-watch because it is the last chance they have to win a game in this tournament. If you are a Zimbabwe fan, this campaign must have been painful to watch, but there could be some light at the end of the tunnel. If you are a neutral fan, watch the game to catch some entertaining characters. #p#Ray Price is one such character. He is enthralling to watch and reminds one of those county cricketers from the days of the yore around whom celebrated writer Neville Cardus would spin a myth. Cardus would have loved Price: He is miserly with the ball and even his run-up, if it can be called that, is miserly. Why waste energy running when you can just walk two steps and let it rip? He almost snarls at the batsmen, loves to sledge, and is known to extend his follow-through to a hand-shaking distance from the batsman. He bowls spin but has a mind of a fast bowler. And he is a fighter. His economy rate is 3.86 from 88 ODIS; not many can boast of such parsimony. It's a pity that he, and his fellow spinners, have been let down so terribly by the batsmen. The captain, Elton Chigumbura, has also been a pale shadow of the hard-hitting batsman that we know he can be. His batting and bowling has been in decline ever since he took over the captaincy - he has picked two wickets at an average of 158.50 from 19 games, and averaged 19.85 with the bat. #p#His opposite number, Jimmy Kamande, has had an interesting ride in this tournament. He began by talking about playing the "Kenyan brand of cricket", but was let down by his batsmen. Then there was a rumour about a rift within the team that needed his intervention before his team finally showed some admirable resistance against Australia. Tanmay Mishra, who displayed such flair and skill against the Australia spinners, will be the man to watch out for against the Zimbabwe tweakers. Collins Obuya has always been flamboyant and it will be the final farewell song for Steve Tikolo, a Kenyan legend. #p#Form guide (completed matches, most recent first) Kenya LLLLL Zimbabwe LLLWL #p#Watch out for... When Steve Tikolo was younger, he used to stun the top teams with his dazzling strokeplay. Age has caught up with him in this tournament and for a batsmen who used to play late, he now seems late on deliveries. However, this is his final shot at glory and he is the type of player who is likely to rise to the occasion. #p#Tatenda Taibu is a player who can thrill and disappoint you in equal measure. There is so much talent to dazzle you but he can press the self-destruct button at any time. He is almost addicted to constant innovation while batting and it often leads to his demise. He has a high of 98 in this tournament but his has scored a total of 136 runs from five games. Which Taibu will turn up tomorrow? The impish version prone to self-destruction or the talented one who will thrill? #p#Team news #p#Kenya will bring back Tikolo for one last hurray and it's to be seen whether Zimbabwe bring back Charles Coventry. #p#Zimbabwe (probable): 1 Brendan Taylor, 2 Regis Chakabva, 3 Tatenda Taibu (wk), 4 Craig Ervine, 5 Elton Chigumbura (capt), 6 Charles Coventry, 7 Greg Lamb, 8 Prosper Utseya, 9 Graeme Cremer, 10 Ray Price, 11 Chris Mpofu. #p#Kenya (probable): 1 Maurice Ouma (wk), 2 Alex Obanda, 3 Collins Obuya, 4 Steve Tikolo, 5 David Obuya, 6 Tanmay Mishra, 7 Thomas Odoyo, 8 Jimmy Kamande (capt), 9 Nehemiah Odhiambo, 10 James Ngoche, 11 Elijah Otieno. #p#Stats and trivia #p#Eighteen of 24 wickets Zimbabwe have taken at the World Cup have gone to their spinners #p#Ray Price has an economy rate of 3.54, the best along with Muttiah Muralitharan and Shahid Afridi, for bowlers who have bowled more than 15 overs in this tournament. #p#Quotes "We fielded well and bowled superbly against Pakistan, but that can't be said about our batting. We have to work on it because that has been the big problem through the tournament. Besides the batting part, we've put up a big fight. My biggest concern is on the batting in the first 15 overs, especially against stronger teams. We have to really work on that when we get home." Elton Chigumbura knows his team's Achilles heel #p#"Steve Tikolo is a legend. He is the man who actually made us play One-day International cricket. He is the one who made us qualify for the first time in 1996 World Cup... Hopefully, we will send him off with a win." Jimmy Kamande hopes for the perfect farewell gift for Tikolo
41	507076	Kenya v Zimbabwe, World Cup 2011, Kolkata	Do it for Tikolo, urges Kamande	ESPNcricinfo staff	March 19, 2011	Steve Tikolo has called time on his long international career, and will bow out after Kenya's game against Zimbabwe Thota Sreenivas Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: Jimmy Kamande | Steve Tikolo Matches: Kenya v Zimbabwe at Kolkata Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Kenya | Zimbabwe #p#Kenya captain Jimmy Kamande has urged his team to give veteran batsman Steve Tikolo a fitting send-off against Zimbabwe at Eden Gardens on Sunday. Tikolo, 39, has been an integral part of all five of Kenya's World Cup campaigns and has announced that he will retire after the current tournament, the match against Zimbabwe his last for Kenya. #p#"We call him 'Gunnzie' (one who bats like a gun)," said Kamande. "He is a legend. He is the man, actually, who made me play one-day international cricket and he is the one who made us qualify for the first time in the 1996 World Cup. I remember watching him play in the qualifiers in 1995 and we owe a lot to the guy. Hopefully, we will send him off with a win." #p#A towering figure in Kenyan cricket and for a time widely held to be the best batsman outside the Test arena, Tikolo played his first representative match for Kenya against Zimbabwe in Nairobi in 1993 at the age of just 21 - a match that Kenya actually won by three wickets - and top-scored with 65 in Kenya's first ever World Cup game, against India at the Barabati Stadium in Cuttack in 1996. #p#He was also part of the Kenyan team which pulled off an upset win over West Indies in that tournament, and captained Kenya to the Semi Finals of the 2003 competition. Kenya's leading runscorer in ODIs by a distance, Tikolo has amassed 3,411 runs, including three hundreds, and has also taken 94 wickets with his offspin. #p#Kamande also expressed his disappointment over Australia captain Ricky Ponting's remarks that Associate cricketing nations shouldn't be involved in the World Cup. "What is disappointing is that someone like Ricky Ponting saying that Associates don't need to be here (in the World Cup)," said Kamande. "We need to keep improving and all we need to do is to play good cricket. #p#"This tournament is a stepping stone for Kenyan cricket. A lot of guys here have never been to the World Cup, we know what it takes to achieve here, whatever we gain, we take it back home with us and try to improve our performance." #p#Kamande suggested that his side desperately needed more top-class matches in between World Cups to raise standards."One thing I know for sure is that if we keep playing against the Test-playing nations or their 'A' sides the [improved] performances will be there. But the thing is after this World Cup you might go and never see these teams again so it becomes very difficult. #p#"If we're going to prepare to play Australia again [in a World Cup] in the next five or 10 years it's going to become very difficult for us [without] regular matches." Since their successful 2003 World Cup campaign, Kenya have played a meagre 12 one-day internationals against the top Test-playing nations, with none at all in the two years leading up to the current competition.
41	507134	Zimbabwe news	Test return excites Zimbabwe coach	ESPNcricinfo staff	March 19, 2011	Zimbabwe coach Alan Butcher has warned Zimbabwe may take some beatings early on in their return to Test cricket AFP Enlarge Related Links News : Tests will make us more competitive - Chigumbura Players/Officials: Alan Butcher Matches: Kenya v Zimbabwe at Kolkata Teams: Zimbabwe #p#Alan Butcher, Zimbabwe's coach, has said the team's return to Test cricket, scheduled for August 2011, after six years of self-imposed exile will be "massive" for the team. #p#"Our return to Test cricket is happening in August against Bangladesh," Butcher told AFP on the eve of Zimbabwe's last match of the on-going World Cup. "I think after that Pakistan and New Zealand come to Zimbabwe to play one Test each and some ODIs. That's going to be a massive thing for Zimbabwe." #p#After withdrawing from Tests in September 2005, Zimbabwe have struggled in ODIs, having won only 32 out of 107 matches in that time, with just five of those victories coming against Test playing nations apart from Bangladesh. Butcher said he was aware it would not be an easy road back into Test cricket for his side. #p#"No doubt you might be wondering if we are going to be up for the challenge and the answer to that, honestly, is probably no. The only place to learn to play Test cricket is by actually doing that. There is no other place that can prepare you. So obviously we will be doing all that we can but I will be surprised if we can come out of it without some beatings in the initial stages. But I hope the players can learn from the experience." #p#Zimbabwe have struggled in the World Cup so far, having lost four out of their five matches. They take on Kenya in their final match on Sunday, at Eden Gardens, and Butcher is hoping for an improved performance. He had earlier pointed to Zimbabwe's exile from Tests as one of the reasons his batsmen were struggling to play long innings and continued to stress that batting had been the team's weakness #p#"Our spin bowling has done a fantastic job, but our batting has been a disappointment. We have not given our spin attack enough chances to win us games. We've scored runs in the past, but it has just not worked out [this time]." #p#Butcher had also stressed on the importance of developing new talent when Zimbabwe re-enter the Test arena, but he did mention Brendan Taylor, Tatenda Taibu, Ray Price and Graeme Cremer from the current crop of players as being important to the teams' future. Zimbabwe's opponents on Sunday, Kenya, have had their own problems through the World Cup, losing all their games so far. But Butcher said Zimbabwe wouldn't be taking anything for granted. #p#"We are making sure we do our homework and ensure that we give them [Kenya] as much respect as we gave other, big teams."

This match was the last in the tournament for both teams, and with little but pride to play for, Kenya captain Jimmy Kamande had urged his team to give Steve Tikolo, playing his final game for his country, a fitting send off. It was not to be, however, as half-centuries from Tatenda Taibu, Vusi Sibanda and Craig Ervine carried Zimbabwe past 300 and Kenya's chase never got off the ground. #p#Chris Mpofu, the solitary specialist seamer in Zimbabwe's side, started Kenya's troubles by removing opener David Obuya in the first over, and three overs later Collins Obuya's run-out brought Tikolo to the crease for the final time in internationals. He got going with a couple of firm flicks to the deep-midwicket boundary but then played back to Price and was struck in line with leg stump to be sent on his way. In a touching sign of respect to the retiring Tikolo, the Zimbabweans rushed in to shake his hand and he left the field, clearly emotional, to a standing ovation from both teams and the smattering of spectators around the ground. #p#Alex Obanda, who appeared to have adjusted to the conditions and had progressed easily into the 20s, lost partner Tanmay Mishra to a top-edged sweep and soon followed him back to the pavilion as an arm ball from Price struck pad before bat as he stretched forward to defend. It was spin that did for Thomas Odoyo too, Greg Lamb ripping one past his defences as he played back in defence, and a successful review by Zimbabwe secued the dismissal. #p#Kenya were in the dire position of 73 for 6 when Odoyo was removed, and slipped even further when Rakep Patel slog-swept straight to Regis Chakabva at deep midwicket for the seventh wicket. Their rapid slide was briefly halted by Nehemiah Odhiambo, who swung his way merrily to an unbeaten 44, but it was only a matter of time before the tail capitulated completely. #p#Zimbabwe's innings had been built around two fluent partnerships. Sibanda and Taibu added 110 for the third wicket to help their team recover from a shaky start and lay a solid platform before Ervine and Chigumbura put on a rollicking 105 to boost the score out of Kenya's reach. #p#The batsmen initially struggled to impose themselves - after Chigumbura's decision to bat -on a cracked, dry surface that got slower and lower as the afternoon wore on. Odhiambo, who impressed with his pace and bounce against Australia in Bangalore, was brought on in the ninth over and with his sixth delivery achieved the breakthrough, a length delivery on a perfect line kissing the edge of Chakabva's bat on the way through to wicketkeeper David Obuya. Taylor followed soon after, playing too early as the ball stopped on the wicket to spoon an easy catch to mid-on as Zimbabwe slipped to 36 for 2. #p#Taibu and Sibanda were generally cautious as they set about constructing a partnership after the early wickets, but while the batting surface was not conducive to stroke-making the outfield remained very fast and both batsmen were quick to seize on the bad ball. While Sibanda was more orthodox in his shots, Taibu was characteristically innovative, twice reverse-sweeping offspinner James Ngoche to the boundary. #p#Kenya wasted both their reviews to contested lbw decisions in an effort to break the stand, but both Sibanda and Taibu barely offered a chance to the bowlers in the course of their partnership and Sibanda, in particular, soon began to take the attack to the bowlers. He reached a 54-ball half-century in the 28th over with an elegant loft over long-on but could have been run out immediately afterwards due a late decision from Taibu to turn a quick single down. #p#There had been several occasions of uncertainty in the running during the partnership, and one over later atrocious running finally cost Sibanda his wicket. Taibu was the man at fault, initially setting off before opting against the run, and with both batsmen at one end Sibanda didn't even bother to attempt to make it back to safety. #p#Zimbabwe's momentum barely dipped despite the wicket, however, and two overs later Taibu brought up his own fifty - and passed 3,000 runs in one-day internationals - with a scything cut to backward point. He paid the price for one cheeky reverse-sweep too many, trapped leg before for 53, but his dismissal brought Ervine and Chigumbura together for the decisive stand of the innings. #p#Once both had settled, they began to ping the boundary with ease and Ervine rushed to his fifty from just 46 balls in the midst of a batting Powerplay that yielded 50 runs and the wicket of Chigumbura - caught at long-on for a rapid 38. With 300 in sight, Ervine chopped a drive onto his own stumps but Lamb and Utseya continued the charge in fine style. #p#Zimbabwe wanted more from their World Cup campaign, but their resounding wins over Canada and Kenya will at least lend credence to their claim that they're too good to be lumped with the Associates as they look forward to a return to Test cricket. The end of Kenya's trip to India also marks something of a new beginning for them, and without Tikolo in their middle order it is now up to a clutch of promising youngsters to rebuild for what is, hopefully, a brighter future. #p#Match Timeline
41	507275	Steve Tikolo retires	Kenya's greatest cricketer	S Rajesh	March 20, 2011	Steve Tikolo played the lone hand on several occasions for Kenya AFP Enlarge Related Links News : Disappointing farewell for Tikolo Players/Officials: Steve Tikolo Matches: Kenya v Zimbabwe at Kolkata Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Kenya #p#An ODI tally of 3421 in 134 matches may not sound like much, but it's a huge deal considering the fact that these stats belong to a batsman from one of the Associate teams. When at the peak of his powers, Steve Tikolo was a classy batsman with talent that isn't reflected in a career average of 28.99. Over a 15-year career Tikolo played five World Cups, and scored an ODI half-century against all Test-playing teams except New Zealand and Pakistan. #p#Tikolo's first one-day international was in the 1996 World Cup, against India. Kenya were beaten comprehensively, but Tikolo was the one Kenyan batsman to make an impression, scoring a smooth and polished 65 when no other team-mate touched 30. #p#Five games later Tikolo showed his debut display was no fluke, creaming 96 off 95 balls against a Sri Lankan attack that included Chaminda Vaas and Muttiah Muralitharan. As was the case so often in his career, this was a lone hand as well, with no one else from Kenya scoring even half as many runs. Tikolo finished that World Cup with an average of 39.20 and a strike rate of 80.99, and it was clear that Kenya had discovered a top-class batsman. #p#Playing for an Associate team reduced his chances of testing himself against the top teams, but he continued to impress on the big occasions whenever the opportunity came along: in the 1999 World Cup he again showed he belonged to a different class compared to the other Kenyan batsmen. Against England, Tikolo scored 71 out of a team total of 203, and he followed that with his second successive World Cup half-century against India. #p#The 2003 World Cup was slightly disappointing from a personal point of view even though Kenya reached the semi-final - Tikolo did get a half-century there, against India again - but in 2007 Tikolo made full use of limited opportunities, scoring 155 in three innings. The highlight was an outstanding 76 against England, in which Tikolo again played the lone hand - the second-highest score in the innings of 177 was 17. #p#Tikolo finished with a career average of 28.99, but that's only because the runs dried up almost completely in his last 17 matches, in which he averaged less than 14. Through most of his career he averaged more than 30, and he performed reasonably well against the top ten teams too. #p#Steve Tikolo's ODI career ODIs Runs Average Strike rate 100s/ 50s Till April 2009 117 3213 31.19 76.40 3/ 23 May 2009 onwards 17 208 13.86 66.45 0/ 1 Career 134 3421 28.99 75.71 3/ 24 Against the top 10 teams 92 2397 27.23 73.95 2/18 Against the rest 42 1024 34.13 80.18 1/ 6 #p#Among Associate batsmen, Tikolo is easily the highest run-getter, with almost 1000 separating him from the next-highest. #p#Highest run-getters in ODIs among batsmen from Associate teams Batsman ODIs Runs Average Strike rate 100s/ 50s Steve Tikolo 130 3362 29.49 75.90 3/ 24 Thomas Odoyo 129 2364 23.64 70.00 1/ 8 Kennedy Otieno 90 2016 23.44 56.61 2/ 12 Ashish Bagai 60 1961 38.45 65.82 2/ 16 Collins Obuya 92 1760 25.88 69.07 0/ 9 #p#Tikolo had managed to bring his best to the table for the World Cups, but his farewell series didn't quite work out the way he would have wanted it to. In four previous World Cups, he had scored a couple of fifties in each, and averaged nearly 35 in those matches. This time, he didn't even manage an aggregate of 50 in the entire World Cup, scoring 44 runs in five innings, with a highest of 13. That's brought his overall World Cup numbers down quite considerably. #p#Tikolo in World Cups Year Matches Runs Average Strike rate 100s/ 50s 1996 6 196 39.20 80.99 0/ 2 1999 5 167 33.40 66.53 0/ 2 2003 9 206 22.88 57.22 0/ 2 2007 3 155 77.50 82.01 0/ 2 2011 5 44 8.80 51.16 0/ 0 All World Cups 28 768 29.53 68.08 0/ 8 #p#Tikolo's contribution to the Kenyan team wasn't only through his batting, though. He also bowled very handy offspin, and finished with 93 ODI wickets at a very acceptable average of 32.95 and an economy rate of 4.73. Among bowlers from Associate teams, only Thomas Odoyo, with 137, has more ODI wickets. #p#Apart from his batting and bowling exploits, Tikolo also led Kenya to one of their finest moments in international cricket, when they reached the semi-final of the 2003 World Cup. With more quality players to support him, Tikolo's numbers, and his impact on Kenyan cricket, would have been even greater.
41	507286	Kenya v Zimbabwe, Group A, World Cup 2011, Kolkata	Disappointing farewell for Tikolo	ESPNcricinfo staff	March 20, 2011	#p#Steve Tikolo, the Kenya batsman, bowed out of international cricket on a disappointing note as his team exited the 2011 World Cup without a win to its name. Kenya were comprehensively beaten by Zimbabwe in their last game, and Tikolo managed only 10 in response to an imposing 308. Zimbabwe and Canada were opponents Kenya would have had a realistic expectation of beating at the start of the tournament, but they found themselves at the receiving end of defeats in each of those games. #p#"I'm very disappointed as this was our last game of the tournament and we wanted to put in a good performance," Tikolo said at the end of the game. "We know we didn't do that, especially with the ball up front. And in our batting we lost wickets at regular intervals and we weren't able to build any meaningful partnerships." #p#Tikolo led Kenya in the match following an injury to regular captain Jimmy Kamande. He was trapped in front by Ray Price and walked back to the pavilion to applause from the Zimbabwe players and the smattering of spectators across the sprawling Eden Gardens. It was an emotional exit for Tikolo, who in a recent interview with ESPNcricinfo had admitted that Kenyan cricket was "at its lowest ebb" at the moment. #p#Tikolo represented Kenya in 134 ODIs and was their captain in the 2003 World Cup when they qualified for the semi-finals, beating Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Zimbabwe along the way. He was also part of one of Kenyan cricket's finest moments, when the national team beat West Indies in Pune in the 1996 World Cup. #p#Steve Tikolo ended a 15-year career with Kenya Thota Sreenivas Enlarge #p#"There have been ups and downs but I've enjoyed every moment," Tikolo said of his career. "I represented my country with a lot of pride and that was the case whenever I went out to play. #p#"If the younger players move forward from this World Cup, take the positives and work on the negatives, that will be a good thing." #p#The lack of exposure against the top teams has cost Kenya, Tikolo said. "In 2003, we had a team that had been together since 1996. We gelled well as players and had been playing good cricket all along, and had fought well against top teams. #p#"Things changed after 2003 as we hardly played top teams. I think we last played Pakistan in 2004 and Australia in 2003. When you meet them in big tournaments it does not do your confidence any good." #p#He added that Kenyan cricket's domestic structure had to change to make the country's cricketers more competitive. "Back at home, we need to revamp the local structure. Youngsters need to play three-day and four-day cricket."
41	507298	Kenya v Zimbabwe, Group A, World Cup 2011, Kolkata	Tests will make us more competitive - Chigumbura	ESPNcricinfo staff	March 20, 2011	#p#Elton Chigumbura, the Zimbabwe captain, has said the team's return to Test cricket will help its players become more competitive at the international level. Zimbabwe ended their World Cup campaign on a positive note, beating Kenya comprehensively at the Eden Gardens to finish with two wins, both against minnows, out of six games. They are scheduled to end their self-imposed isolation from Tests in August this year, when they take on Bangladesh followed by Pakistan and New Zealand. #p#"The next three months are going to be very important for us. We are all excited about playing Test cricket and we know it is going to improve us as players," Chigumbura said. "We have to put in hard work in the coming three months. We know where we are and what we need to do before we start our first game." #p#The transition to playing Tests, Zimbabwe coach Alan Butcher said, was not going to be easy. The Tests against Bangladesh later in the year will be Zimbabwe's first since September 2005. "No doubt you might be wondering if we are going to be up for the challenge and the answer to that, honestly, is probably 'no'," Butcher said. #p#"The only place to learn to play Test cricket is actually by doing that. There is no other place that can prepare you for that." #p#Zimbabwe completed an easy win in Kolkata Getty Images Enlarge #p#Internal problems led Zimbabwe to exclude itself from Test cricket in 2006 when it failed to field a competitive team. Zimbabwe have played 83 Tests since 1992, winning eight and losing 49. #p#Zimbabwe's batting, which Butcher had said had been affected by the lack of Tests, stepped up against Kenya with Tatenda Taibu, Vusi Sibanda and Craig Ervine striking half-centuries. The spinners then defended 308 by skittling out Kenya for 147. #p#"We have to take the positives from today. When we go back home, we have to continue working on our batting," Chigumbura said. "I'm very happy with the win. The guys played well all round today, especially with the bat, which is something that we've asked for the whole tournament. You can't ask more from the bowling department, the guys have been consistent."

When MS Dhoni walks out for the toss for this game, it will have been more than a week since they last played in the World Cup. The off days for the Indian team, however, have been days of plenty of buzz and activity for the Indian cricketing public and media. Dhoni has suddenly gone from being Midas to moron for getting Ashish Nehra to bowl the final over; Yusuf Pathan is no longer a good choice to bat in batting Powerplay; heated meetings between selectors, board secretary and captain have been reported and denied ; the moon's proximity to the earth has had its say; the next coach has become a topic of discussion; UDRS blunders and Sachin Tendulkar's impending 100th hundred have been overshadowed; everything that can be debated, even those that cannot be, have been debated. #p#If you have been watching news channels in India, or reading news publications, doom is not too far. Which is why the players have been asked to stay far away. Which is why it is a good thing that they are back on the field where they can sort out their team combination for the knockouts, and there are issues bothering them. Piyush Chawla's inclusion in the XV, always a bit inexplicable, has so far been exposed as a mistake, a gamble gone wrong, which reduces India's options if they feel that either of Munaf Patel or Nehra is out of form. #p#And Virat Kohli - this will sound harsh on a young man in the form of his life - has hurt the team balance a bit, forcing Suresh Raina out, who is more suited at the slog end and is a pretty canny part-time offspinner. For this game, though, India might not have to make a choice, for Virender Sehwag is down with an allergic reaction to a painkiller injection. #p#India's opponents are now assured of a place in the knockouts, but the game is just as big for them. Bangladesh are the only Test team West Indies have beaten in an ODI since June 28, 2009, which hurts them bad. Also painful will be how they didn't trust themselves to play normal cricket and finish a middling chase against England after the explosive start by Chris Gayle. They will dearly love to end that unflattering streak, and in the process finish at No. 2 in Group B, thus avoiding the best two sides from Group A in the quarter-final. #p#If it provides some comfort, the previous major team West Indies beat was India, in Jamaica, through aggressive bowling. They will rate their chances because they are up against a side that is under pressure, no matter how much it avoids the media and the public. A side that will have done really well if it plays uninhibited, free-flowing cricket. West Indies might think the iron is hot. #p#Chennai is certainly hot, and its spinner-friendly track and reverse-friendly square have provided the two matches of the tournament so far. The World Cup will want to bid it a fitting farewell before it moves to the flatter, more predictable surfaces. #p#Form guide (completed matches, most recent first) #p#India LWWTW West Indies LWWWL #p#Watch out for... #p#Chris Gayle has to be hurting. In a chase of 244, he left his side at 58 for 1 in the seventh over, but the rest still managed to fall 18 short. Will he go back to reining himself in and playing through the innings? Will he decide to make Sunday his day and his day alone, and go swinging? #p#Sides have decided the best way to beat India, at least when they are on the field, is to play Harbhajan Singh out and not give him wickets. Hence an economy-rate of 4.41, but only five wickets. At times it works for India, producing more wicket-taking opportunities for the other bowlers that the batsmen feel compelled to attack. In this World Cup, it has worked for the batsmen. Chennai, though, will be Harbhajan's best chance of taking wickets: a turning pitch, and a fair sprinkling of left-hand batsmen. #p#Team news #p#R Ashwin, through all indicators, seems to the be the man India want the world to see as little of as possible before the big matches. Is a match that determines whether they face New Zealand or Sri Lanka in the quarter-final big enough? #p#Sehwag is a big doubt. "Viru has got an allergic reaction in his right knee, so we will take that call either in the evening or on the morning of the game," Dhoni said. #p#India (probable): 1 Gautam Gambhir, 2 Sachin Tendulkar, 3 Virat Kohli, 4 Yuvraj Singh, 5 MS Dhoni (capt. & wk), 6 Suresh Raina, 7 Yusuf Pathan, 8 Harbhajan Singh, 9 Zaheer Khan, 10 & 11 two out of Ashish Nehra, R Ashwin and Munaf Patel #p#Leaving Shivnarine Chanderpaul was a brave move on paper, but it did backfire on West Indies when they missed one batsman who would take the responsibility and anchor the chase on a difficult track. Do they bring him back? If they do, that will mean dropping either one of the specialist batsmen or one out of Andre Russell and Devendra Bishoo, both of whom had a superb game against England. Right now, Ramnaresh Sarwan seems to be the most disposable member of the XI that lost to England. #p#West Indies (probable) 1 Chris Gayle, 2 Devon Smith, 3 Darren Bravo, 4 Ramnaresh Sarwan/Shivnarine Chanderpaul, 5 Kieron Pollard, 6 Darren Sammy (capt.), 7 Devon Thomas (wk), 8 Andre Russell, 9 Sulieman Benn, 10 Kemar Roach, 11 Devendra Bishoo. #p#Pitch and conditions #p#Expect another baked turner with a hard square that should facilitate reverse-swing. For those looking for respite from the Chennai heat, the following is not good news. Chance of precipitation on Sunday: 0%. #p#Stats and trivia #p#Legspinner Bishoo took three wickets on his debut in Chennai. Twenty three years ago, a legspinner in a similar mould, took 16 wickets on his Test debut, again in Chennai. West Indies then were at the receiving end of Narendra Hirwani. #p#Everybody knows Sachin Tendulkar is one short of reaching 100 international hundreds, but he is also just 47 short of 18,000 ODI runs. #p#The World Cup head-to-head between the teams is tied at three and three. #p#Quotes #p#"It is a big learning curve and hopefully we won't repeat the same mistakes that have happened so far. We are human beings, we are always supposed to commit mistakes. Hopefully the interval between two will be long." Vintage MS Dhoni
42	507033	India v West Indies, Group B, World Cup, Chennai	Sehwag doubtful for West Indies match	ESPNcricinfo staff	March 19, 2011	Virender Sehwag is hampered by swollen right knee, which is the result of allergic reaction Getty Images Enlarge Related Links News : Ashwin, Raina likely to play West Indies Features : India ahead in trial by spin Features : India look to kick the habit Players/Officials: Virender Sehwag Matches: India v West Indies at Chennai Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: India #p#Virender Sehwag might miss India's final group game against West Indies on Sunday because of a knee problem. Sehwag's knee has been bothering him since the start of the World Cup, but his current worry is the result of swelling caused by an allergic reaction to a pain-killing injection he took after the match against South Africa. #p#"Viru [Sehwag] has got an allergic reaction in his right knee, so we will take that call [about whether to play him] either in the evening or on the morning of the game," MS Dhoni said at the MA Chidambaram Stadium on Saturday. #p#If Sehwag is unable to take the field, Gautam Gambhir will most likely open the innings with Sachin Tendulkar. #p#The game doesn't have a lot riding on it as Bangladesh's defeat to South Africa today means India and England are already through to the quarter-finals and barring a catastrophic defeat, West Indies can afford to lose tomorrow's game and still join them on the basis of a better net run-rate than Bangladesh.
42	507071	India v West Indies, Group B, World Cup 2011, Chennai	Team no longer dependent on Gayle - Sammy	Dileep Premachandran in Chennai	March 19, 2011	#p#When he came for his media briefing on Saturday afternoon, Darren Sammy wasn't sure that West Indies were assured of a place in the last eight. South Africa had done their bit with the bat, but he didn't know Bangladesh would subside so meekly to guarantee his team a quarter-final berth. #p#It's been a strange sort of tournament for West Indies, with three consecutive wins against the lesser sides sandwiched by losses to South Africa and England. But having avoided the potential banana skins, they will be dangerous opponents for anyone. #p#"Our first objective when we came here was to qualify for the knockout stage," said Sammy. "No matter what happens in the other game, we'll focus on India." #p#Had they not lost their composure and four wickets for three runs on Thursday night, West Indies would have headed into Sunday's game with a chance of topping their group. That collapse made some question Shivnarine Chanderpaul's exclusion, though 70 runs from three innings at a dismal strike rate is hardly a ringing endorsement for his inclusion. #p#"We'll meet tonight and identify our best combination," said Sammy. "We all respect what Shiv has done for the team in the past. He's one of our most experienced players." #p#The tournament has yet to see a monumental effort from Chris Gayle, and Sammy suggested it was a good sign that the team was no longer dependent on him. "Before, when Chris got out, we used to crumble," he said. "That's not the case with the present crop. When Chris got out early against South Africa, we still made 220-odd. In the last game, young [Devendra] Bishoo and [Andre] Russell stepped up. I think it's a good thing that we've had contributions from different individuals." #p#It's a good sign, says Darren Sammy, that contributions have been made by several individuals, like Devendra Bishoo in the last game Associated Press Enlarge #p#What West Indies haven't done, however, is beat a top side in nearly two years. "Winning is a habit," said Sammy. "We're aware that we've come close recently. It's the key moments in games that we've let slip. But we have been creating opportunities to win." #p#Against India, many eyes will be on the pitch. The same strip was used in the warm-up game against New Zealand. India batted first, piled up a mammoth total and won by a street. "It's the first time I've seen a tent over a wicket," he said. "But I think it's similar to the one used in our match against England. Both teams should have scored more runs then, but it did turn a lot more in the second innings." #p#Sammy has lost all five tosses in this competition. "Hopefully I'll win one and we can bat first," he said with a smile - West Indies might need that reversal of coin-fortune with India almost certain to play two offspinners against a line-up full of left-handers. #p#Graeme Swann and the unheralded James Tredwell produced combined figures of 7-84 in the West Indies' previous game, but Sammy was confident he had the personnel to keep India at bay. "I wouldn't say we have a problem [against spin]," he said. "We will have a different strategy for India. We have both power players and guys who can rotate the strike." #p#For Ottis Gibson, who left his post as England's bowling coach to try and engineer a change in West Indies' fortunes, the challenge is to ensure that mistakes are not repeated. "We've had to ask youngsters to learn at the international level, which is very tough," he said, speaking to ESPNCricinfo the day after the England game. "We have to make sure we don't make the kind of mistakes we made last night. #p#"With time, we'll get back to winning matches. After the England game, I told them: 'We didn't get beaten. We gave the game away'. Everything we set out to do, we did. Chris [Gayle] went out and played the way he can. We then had Sammy coming in and give us even more impetus. We were way ahead of the rate. All we had to do was bat through. We didn't apply enough thought." #p#West Indies haven't played India at the World Cup since 1996, when Sachin Tendulkar's 70 - he was dropped a couple of times - gave India a fairly comfortable five-wicket win in Gwalior. Richie Richardson, here as team manager, top scored for West Indies that day. He, Gibson and Sammy will hope that this team - with its big players yet to hit their stride - can at least emulate that side, which qualified as an afterthought and then came within a Shane Warne-spell of the final.
42	507081	India v West Indies, Group B, World Cup 2011, Chennai	Ashwin, Raina likely to play West Indies	Sharda Ugra in Chennai	March 19, 2011	#p#The reception given to MS Dhoni at his pre-match media briefing before India's final group match at the World Cup reflected none of the heated arguments on in print or television, or even outside the media conference room at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Rather than a barrage of unpleasant questions about captaincy, the Indian team's batting performance in Nagpur, Ashish Nehra's 50th over or R Ashwin's debut, the treatement could be described as cordial. "Happy Holi, Mahi," a reporter said, referring to the famous festival of colours that will spread across most of India over the weekend. Dhoni wished the reporter back warmly. When the question about the batting did turn up, Dhoni decided to leave the colourful quotes behind and tried splashing some whitewash over Nagpur. #p#Dhoni was asked whether there had been a thorough debrief after India lost their last nine wickets for 29 runs in their defeat to South Africa. He replied: "The beauty of our batting side is that you don't need to always pinpoint what went wrong or what needs to be done. The amount of experience we have got, the moment you commit a mistake you realise, okay, this is what exactly went wrong." What happened in Nagpur, he said did not "need to be addressed in a big way. Most of us have played over 100 games. But the better sides are the ones who do not repeat their mistakes in short intervals." #p#India's biggest mistakes in its two matches against top-flight teams - England and South Africa - he said, had been to take their foot off the pedal after the best of starts. "It's not only about how well you have started the game and how long you have dominated, you can't say you have won a game till it's over. It is a big learning and hopefully we won't repeat the same mistakes that have happened so far. We are human beings; we are always supposed to commit mistakes. Hopefully the interval between two will be long." All of India will be wishing that the interval would at least be longer than the next two weeks. #p#R Ashwin is likely to get a game after cooling his heels for the previous group-stage matches Associated Press Enlarge #p#After being pretty tight-lipped about team selection through the tournament so far, Dhoni stuck his neck out this time, and said "everyone" on his team "would have played at least one game before the knockout stage." Translated that means that the two men who have not had a match so far, Suresh Raina and R Ashwin, will be in the XI on Sunday. #p#Dented reputation or not, what India still has is belief within the batting and the fact that the unit as a whole is "due" Their captain said so with emphasis. "Our seven batsmen have not fired at their best. If we get a really good day on the field with the batting department, we have the capabilities of putting huge totals on the board and it will definitely be a par plus score." #p#The question that produced the response was one about the batting. But, as if on autopilot, Dhoni produced a spontaneous, unsolicited comment on India's fielding, just in case anyone would slip the question in. "I do not see plenty of improvement in the fielding department. We are definitely not as good as some of the teams in the present World Cup but on our own we have shown that we are improving. Our good fielders are doing better every game and our safer fielders are getting better in each and every game." #p#Sunday's match would be the last game for India with a safety net of any kind - Bangladesh's loss on Saturday has guaranteed their path to the quarter-finals - yet an unconvincing performance against West Indies is, unlike one of India's practice sessions, not an option.
42	507111	India v West Indies, Group B, World Cup 2011, Chennai	India ahead in trial by spin	S Rajesh	March 19, 2011	#p#West Indies have been struggling to compete against the top teams for a while now, and their record when playing at the home of their opponents is quite poor - since 2000, their overall away record is 35 wins and 53 defeats. However, India is the one country where they've competed well, with six wins and as many defeats against India in India since 2000. In fact, India have an overall head-to-head advantage against West Indies since 2000, but that's mainly because of their win-loss record in neutral venues - 6-2. #p#In World Cup games too there's been nothing to choose between the two teams: the two teams have shared the six matches equally, and so egalitarian have they been that neither team has won two in a row. West Indies won the first one in 1979, India won two out of three in 1983, while West Indies won in 1992 and lost in 1996. If that trend continues, West Indies can look forward to upsetting the form book on Sunday. #p#ODIs between India and West Indies ODIs India won WI won Overall 95 38 54 Since 2000 32 17 14 In India since 2000 12 6 6 In World Cups 6 3 3 In Champions Trophy 3 1 2 #p#The West Indian batsmen have generally enjoyed the pitches and the conditions in India, though the track in Chennai might not be as favourable to run-scoring as some of the other venues in the country. Chris Gayle averages almost 56 in ODIs in India, with six of his 19 ODI centuries coming in this country. Shivnarine Chanderpaul and Ramnaresh Sarwan both average more than 40 too, though neither has got going in the World Cup so far: in seven innings between them, the highest either batsman has scored is 49. In fact, batting has been a worry for West Indies in the tournament, with Darren Bravo, Chanderpaul and Sarwan all averaging less than 30. #p#West Indies batsmen in ODIs in India Batsman ODIs Runs Average Strike rate 100s/ 50s Chris Gayle 22 1117 55.85 94.18 6/ 3 Shivnarine Chanderpaul 20 732 48.80 76.40 1/ 6 Ramnaresh Sarwan 19 665 47.50 80.60 0/ 5 Kieron Pollard 4 178 44.50 161.81 0/ 2 Devon Smith 7 277 39.57 72.89 1/ 1 Darren Bravo 4 108 27.00 78.26 0/ 1 #p#The Indian batsmen have done reasonably well at home against West Indies since 2000, but the one player who has struggled is Yuvraj Singh: in eight innings he has managed only 209 runs at an average of 26.12. #p#If the last two matches at the MA Chidambaram Stadium are any indication, spinners will have plenty to do on Sunday, and the batting team which handles the spin better could be the winner. On that count, India seem to be better equipped. West Indies have lost 19 out of 39 wickets to spin, and their average and run-rate against spin are much poorer than the corresponding numbers against pace. The Indians have a much higher average against spin, while there's almost no difference between their run-rates against pace and spin. #p#West Indies against pace and spin in this World Cup Against Runs Balls Wickets Average Run rate Pace 737 751 20 36.85 5.88 Spin 374 476 19 19.68 4.71 #p#India against pace and spin in this World Cup Runs Balls Wickets Average Run rate Pace 719 708 20 35.95 6.09 Spin 686 678 14 49.00 6.07 #p#The overall pace and spin numbers for Chennai in this World Cup suggest that fast bowlers have done better than spinners, but that's largely because of the first game at the venue, when Kenya crumbled against New Zealand's fast bowlers.

At the first sliver of light, the streets are dotted with people delivering milk and newspapers, setting up flower stalls, going for walks. Even the sun over Marina Beach switches swiftly onto a full beam in March, demanding that the day be seized. #p#India are not the early risers of this World Cup. They come to Chennai knowing that every little detail of the team will soon be under its fierce glare, from their brightest parts to all that is hidden in India's shadows. On Sunday, the team will not only wrestle against West Indies, but also try to clutch at their reputation that has dangerously peeled away, layer by layer, over the course of this World Cup. #p#At the moment, all attention is focussed on India's brightest parts: the batting that is due one blazing firecracker of a performance, the bowling that could be revitalised with a fresh face and a new edge, and the undeniable fact that their rivals can often be brittle under pressure and have a great sense of detachment from the art of playing spin. #p#Yet it is from the shadow that India must find their answers, because after Sunday, they will be into what captain MS Dhoni calls the World Cup's "lottery stages" India's 'vision document' for the tournament contains a paragraph that says, "The fight is won or lost far away from witnesses. You don't succeed when your dream is accomplished... you are succeeding or failing right now. Your daily habits will determine how far you go." #p#As India prepare for their last group game, the result of which will determine whom they play against in the Ahmedabad quarter-final, they will have to undo all habits formed over the five group games sprawled over a month. With the undeniable advantage of hindsight, Dhoni and his team know that what they are missing in this World Cup (apart from sharp fielders, of course) is the detailing. #p#This has happened at an event where the broadest brush has been constantly swept around in their favour: the format has been fool-proofed so that the disasters of 2007 are avoided. Barring their opening match, India play every single game in conditions they know well. Australia and Sri Lanka are now on gas awaiting Sunday's result to work out who will travel to Ahmedabad for the quarter-final. No-one on BCCI's payroll will be lent out to visiting teams as temporary support staff even in emergencies. In this environment, the team has not performed with an assurance its fans need, its Board wants and its competitors would be daunted by. Sachin Tendulkar's two centuries have virtually disappeared behind a blur of India's uncrossed 't's. #p#Against England, India's first World Cup match against one of the stronger teams in its group, a single was run short on the last ball of the innings. Against Ireland and Netherlands, India lost its top four within 100 runs when chasing, a warning sign about the batting's collective sense of direction. That then morphed into the thoughtless 9 for 29, against South Africa. #p#Eight balls were left unplayed in that innings. At the tail-end of the South African innings in Nagpur, a catch dropped of Morne van Wyk was forgotten because the batsmen fell three balls later but then the ball had also wobbled over the boundary. That was runs conceded. In the 49th over in Nagpur, an easy run-out chance with the two batsmen stranded at handshaking distance in the middle of the pitch was fluffed because of a bad throw. The batsman? Robin Petersen, who got a streaky inside-edged four off Ashish Nehra's first ball in the last over, and then hit the six that swung the match South Africa's way. #p#On Sunday night, India and West Indies will fill in the final details as to how the World Cup knockouts will be shaped. India needs its most precise performance, with no straggly bits in selection, batting orders or bowling changes. The injury to Virender Sehwag may see him sit out the game and give him time to get ready for Ahmedabad, and it will also act as India's best option to still persist with its power hitter Yusuf Pathan and try out both newbies, Suresh Raina and R Ashwin. #p#It is as if the pieces of advice offered in the vision document by Tour de France champion Lance Armstrong are now taking on a life of their own. "Pick your battles," Armstrong advises, saying that businesses and teams need "detailed strategies on which stages to win and which to sit back." The World Cup is the same, Dhoni's team has been told. "You can't win every battle. However, you can win the important ones." #p#Sunday's game qualifies as one of those. Irrespective of the result, West Indies are not expected be India's most formidable opposition in the tournament. Yet, it could be the match in which the World Cup's late risers finally reveal what they are really capable of doing when fully awake.
42	507223	India v West Indies, World Cup 2011, Group B, Chennai	Yuvraj stars as India finish second	The Bulletin by Sidharth Monga	March 20, 2011	#p#India 268 (Yuvraj 113, Kohli 59, Rampaul 5-51) beat West Indies 188 (Smith 81, Sarwan 39, Zaheer 3-26) by 80 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details How they were out #p#Zaheer Khan sparked West Indies' collapse by removing the set Devon Smith AFP Enlarge Related Links Analysis : An early departure and an umpire caught napping Features : Hanging tough through the trough Analysis : West Indies search for winning feeling News : Zaheer strike turned match - Dhoni Matches: India v West Indies at Chennai Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: India | West Indies #p#Oh West Indies, they have done it again. For the second match in a row they had a chase all wrapped up but some desperate inspiration from Zaheer Khan and Harbhajan Singh and some mindless cricket from the batsmen who followed Devon Smith ensured that West Indies remained without a win over a Test side other than Bangladesh since June 2009. With Smith playing as well as he has ever played, West Indies almost mocked India for the first 27 overs, getting up to 146 for 2 without a care in the world. Then came a maiden by Harbhajan and a wicked Zaheer slower ball to remove Smith, and West Indies lost the last eight wickets for 34. #p#That collapse outdid India's own - 7 for 50 - that had threatened to undo Yuvraj Singh's century on a track whose bounce West Indies and Ravi Rampaul exploited, but not to the fullest. Rampaul, the hero of West Indies' last win against a major side, took his first five-for in ODIs on his World Cup debut to hurt the start, the middle and the end of the Indian innings. However, West Indies' insistence on opening the bowling with Sulieman Benn despite the helpful track, and the obvious plan of trying to bounce India out meant they couldn't capitalise on a first over that claimed Sachin Tendulkar. Then there was Yuvraj, with his maiden World Cup century, fighting dehydration, vomiting on the field, and then coming back to take two wickets. #p#The game might have ended in a whimper, but it began explosively. As they successfully did in the last two World Twenty20s, West Indies came out with bouncers for India. Inside the first 11 overs, two deliveries bounced over the keeper's head for byes, two batsmen got out to deliveries dug in short, one was dropped off another short delivery, but Benn went for 21 off his three overs to ease the pressure. To make matters worse Darren Sammy dropped Yuvraj twice, chances not easy but not impossible, at 9 and 13. #p#Working with Yuvraj was Virat Kohli, for whom it was almost a homecoming to bat at No. 3 in the absence of the injured Virender Sehwag. In familiar environs of not having to score at a strike-rate of 150, Kohli did just what was required on a tough pitch after a tough start, scoring 59 off 76, letting Yuvraj take the majority of the strike in a 122-run partnership, after the two had come together at 51 for 2. #p#Even after Yuvraj was reprieved twice, the bouncers still kept coming, the odd ball still misbehaved - especially for the left-hand batsman. He got dehydrated and threw up but nothing seemed to be able to stop the Yuvraj specials in between, shots that kept the scoring rate up in the middle overs. Kohli was smart too: he had played 21 deliveries when Yuvraj came to join him, but so good was the strike manipulation that Yuvraj had played 12 more deliveries than him by the time their partnership ended. #p#Quarter-final line-up Pakistan v West Indies in Dhaka on 23 March Australia v India in Ahmedabad on 24 March New Zealand v South Africa in Dhaka on 25 March Sri Lanka v England in Colombo on 26 March The winner of the third quarter-final will play the winner of the fourth in the semi-finals in Colombo on 29 March, while the other semi-final will be played in Mohali on March 30 #p#During the partnership, Yuvraj pulled over midwicket, cover-drove for fours along the ground, swept the legspin of Devendra Bishoo, and on-drove Sammy over long-on for a majestic six. It was one of those days when Yuvraj was feeling it, one of those days when he plays one level above the game around him. His mates, though, managed to engineer another collapse from 218 for 3 in the 42nd over. #p#Buoyed by that good finish with the ball, West Indies came out positive. As Rampaul stood up in the absence of the unwell Kemar Roach, so Smith did in place of the injured Chris Gayle. He cut furiously - almost every bowler got a taste of his trademark shot - he picked singles straight to infielders, doubles straight to those in the deep. However, R Ashwin, who got his World Cup debut at long last, was difficult to hit with the new ball. He used his carrom ball to remove the potentially explosive Kirk Edwards. #p#Still Smith and Darren Bravo first, and Smith and Ramnaresh Sarwan thereafter kept knocking off the runs calmly. The running between the wickets, and then the odd boundary to break a string of dots, remained a feature. The panic and rush that characterised their effort against England was conspicuous in its absence. With Smith scoring at will, and West Indies needing just 123 in the last 23 overs, only West Indies stood in the way of West Indies. #p#Turned out they needed a bit of help from India to kickstart the collapse. It came through a maiden from Harbhajan, who came back remarkably after an uninspiring spell of four overs for 23 with the new ball. Harbhajan and Munaf Patel put together a spell of 19 balls for just eight runs before Zaheer was called upon to provide the exclamation mark. #p#And how he did, with his new knuckle slower ball, where the middle finger doesn't hold the ball tightly, thus taking the pace off without giving any indication to those who are watching from the front. With that slower ball, he removed Smith's off stump after a virtually faultless innings. After that, the procession began. Kieron Pollard holed out to long-on at the first sight of pressure, Sammy was sold down the river by Sarwan, Devon Thomas and Andre Russell fell to the wiles of Yuvraj, and it was all over. #p#The way West Indies and India collapsed, conspiracy theorists will waste no time in suggesting that both teams wanted to avoid Australia in the quarter-final. As it turned out, West Indies finished fourth in Group B, thus getting Group A leaders Pakistan in Dhaka. And India renew hostilities with Australia in Ahmedabad. #p#Match Timeline

42	507318	India v West Indies, Group B, World Cup 2011, Chennai	Allrounder Yuvraj, and the middle-overs comparison	S Rajesh	March 20, 2011	Yuvraj SIngh is one of only four Indians with a 50-plus World Cup average Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: Ravi Rampaul | Yuvraj Singh Matches: India v West Indies at Chennai Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: India | West Indies #p#Coming into the World Cup, Yuvraj Singh wasn't exactly in top form: in 19 innings since the beginning of 2010, he'd averaged 27.50 at a strike rate of 69.73, with only one innings of more than 60. His first innings in this World Cup, though, was a superbly fluent unbeaten 58 off 50 against England, and that seems to have put him perfectly in groove. That knock was followed by two unbeaten fifties, and his century against West Indies means he has scored 284 runs in the tournament at an average of 94.67 and a strike rate of 86.06. Add his nine wickets to the mix, and Yuvraj has been the perfect answer to India's call for an allrounder. Another 16 runs and one wicket will make him only the fourth player in World Cup history to achieve the double of 300 runs and ten wickets in a tournament: Kapil Dev (1983), Neil Johnson (1999) and Sanath Jayasuriya (2003) are the only ones to have achieved it so far. #p#In this innings, the highlight was the way he shifted gears effortlessly in the second half of his innings. His first scoring shot only came off his eighth ball, but it was a confident pull for four, and it set the tone for the rest of his innings. Off the first 50 deliveries he faced, he scored only 37, but off the next 73, he scored 76. #p#How Yuvraj Singh paced his innings First 25 balls 26-50 balls 51-75 balls 76-100 balls Last 23 balls Runs scored 19 18 30 23 23 #p#His outstanding run in this tournament means Yuvraj's overall World Cup average has touched 50, which is well above his career average of 37.43 - in 18 World Cup innings he has scored eight fifties and a hundred. Among those who've scored 600 runs in World Cups, only three India batsmen have a higher average. This was also Yuvraj's fourth 50-plus score in this World Cup, which puts him in an elite category: among Indian batsmen, only two have done better. #p#For West Indies, it all went wrong after the 27th over of their run-chase. Till then, they were nine runs ahead of India's score at the same stage, with two batsmen well set and seemingly toying with the Indian attack. All that changed with Harbhajan Singh's maiden in the 28th, after which they lost a clutch of wickets. By the end of the 37th over, West Indies had fallen 30 runs behind India's score, and with seven batsmen back in the hutch, the game was over. Whereas India scored 58 for 1 between overs 28 and 37, West Indies stuttered to 19 for 5, a fall from which there were no comebacks. #p#How West Indies lost the plot After 27 overs After 37 overs India 137 for 2 195 for 3 West Indies 146 for 2 165 for 7 #p#That was also the period when Ramnaresh Sarwan, who had looked fluent for the first part of his innings, suddenly went into his shell. He'd scored 23 from his first 31 balls, playing only 16 dot balls, but off the next 31 he scored only nine and played out 22 dots, including the maiden over from Harbhajan. It didn't help, of course, that so many wickets went down at the other end. #p#How Sarwan's fluency disappeared Runs scored Dot balls Singles Twos Fours First 31 balls 23 16 11 2 2 Next 31 balls 9 22 9 0 0 #p#The one big positive for West Indies was the form of Ravi Rampaul. His recent form justified his omission from the team so far: in his last 12 ODIs against the top teams, he had averaged almost 40 runs per wicket at nearly a run a ball. In these 12 games, he had gone at six an over or more seven times. Like Yuvraj, though, Rampaul shrugged off poor form with his best figures in one-day internationals, and his maiden five-for. It was also the sixth five-for by a West Indies player in a World Cup, but only the third against one of the top teams, after Winston Davis' 7 for 51 against Australia in 1983, and Joel Garner's 5 for 38 against England in 1979.
42	507319	India v West Indies, Group B, World Cup 2011, Chennai	An early departure and an umpire caught napping	Sharda Ugra at the MA Chidambaram Stadium	March 20, 2011	Darren Sammy had two chances to catch Yuvraj Singh early in his innings, but missed them both Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Report : Yuvraj stars as India finish second Players/Officials: Darren Sammy | Simon Taufel | Sachin Tendulkar | Yuvraj Singh Matches: India v West Indies at Chennai Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: India | West Indies #p#The departure of the day He was welcomed; it was awaited and it took all of four minutes to snuff it all out. Sachin Tendulkar's nick off a Ravi Rampaul beauty was met with a shake off the head by umpire Steve Davis and the ultimate compliment from the batsman, who turned on his heel and walked off to deafening silence. Okay, it's not the World Cup semi-final but remember, the UDRS is minus the snickometer; and this on a day when Ricky Ponting admitted he doesn't walk. #p#Clumsy captain of the day As if dropping Yuvraj Singh once is not enough, Darren Sammy did it twice within seven balls. If a salmon-like leap at point was not enough to give Andre Russell a wicket with Yuvraj on 9, Sammy had another chance off his own bowling, in his very first over, as a leading edge shot past him. Yuvraj was on 13, and despite cramps and dehydration, he wouldn't leave for another 100 runs. #p#The non-review In the fourth over of the West Indian innings, there was a rare World Cup occurrence: a direct hit from an India fielder. That should have caught umpire Simon Taufel's attention. Yet no amount of muted appealing by the fielder Virat Kohli, or his colleagues Zaheer Khan and Munaf Patel led Taufel to ask for upstairs assistance. Turns out Kirk Edwards, who had scored seven at the time, had actually been caught short. He was out three overs later, but in a tournament where reviews have been aplenty, surely Taufel couldn't have thought going to the third umpire for a close run-out decision would be a waste of time. #p#The debut The first time India opened the bowling with a spinner, in this World Cup, R Ashwin's parsimonious first-over was greeted with applause, cheers and approving whistles. In his fourth over, there came the wicket. Was that the sound of the door slowly creaking shut against Piyush Chawla? #p#The choke It began with a maiden; the 28th over of the West Indian innings put the brakes on a chase that was rolling along smoothly, as opener Devon Smith and Ramnaresh Sarwan built a partnership. Harbhajan Singh bowled a maiden to Sarwan, and the unravelling began. Over the course of the next ten overs, West Indies scored 22 runs and lost five wickets. #p#Tipping point of the day At 154 for 2, West Indies were going at a bossa nova tempo, with opener Devon Smith holding together three partnerships that took the men in maroon to a position from where they needed 115 off just under 20 overs. Then Zaheer Khan returned for his second spell, in reverse gear, and stopped Smith's composed innings short. Pollard fell in the next over and the West Indian sand-castle began crumbling.
42	507324	India v West Indies, World Cup 2011, Chennai	Zaheer strike turned match - Dhoni	ESPNcricinfo staff	March 20, 2011	MS Dhoni said Zaheer Khan's strike in his second spell allowed India to attack AFP Enlarge Related Links Report : Yuvraj stars as India finish second Players/Officials: MS Dhoni Matches: India v West Indies at Chennai Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: India | West Indies #p#MS Dhoni, the India captain, identified Zaheer Khan's dismissal of Devon Smith in the first over of his second spell as the turning point of the match at Chepauk. Zaheer had only bowled two overs in his first spell and was, presumably, being saved for when the ball got a bit older and reverse-swing came into play. He struck with the older ball, in the 31st over, with a slower ball that bowled Smith, who had anchored West Indies' chase with a well-compiled 81. #p#"The game really changed once Zaheer gave us the breakthrough; until then Devon was batting really well," Dhoni said at the post-match presentation. "After that we could apply pressure from both ends, and eventually we got more wickets than we needed and we seized the game in the end." #p#Prior to Zaheer's strike, West Indies had eased their way to 154 for 2 with first Darren Bravo and then Ramnaresh Sarwan building fifty partnerships with Smith. The game seemed to be slipping away from India, but the fall of Smith's wicket allowed Dhoni to attack - at one point he had three close-in fielders for Harbhajan Singh - and West Indies crumbled under the pressure. #p#India's performance with the bat had been reminiscent of the performance against South Africa in Nagpur. This time it was Yuvraj Singh's turn to score a century, only to see the position he had brought India to squandered by a late collapse. India lost their last seven wickets for 50 runs, with four falling for just 28 after Yuvraj's dismissal in the 45th over. #p#Against South Africa, the collapse had been 9 for 29, and Dhoni recognised that losing wickets in a flurry at the end of the innings was becoming a problem for India, particularly because it wasn't allowing them to take advantage of the batting Powerplay. #p#"It [losing wickets] is a concern. But there is a gradual improvement and I am sure we will be at our best in the quarters. That's the positive I will take out of this." #p#India's 80-run win set up a quarter-final with Australia, to be played in Ahmedabad on March 24. They have lost to Australia in nine out of 15 matches played in India during the last five years, and Dhoni was aware of the challenge ahead of his team. #p#"Australia are a very strong side and very expressive on the field. But it's about how we prepare. Preparation is very important and we are just thinking about that particular day and match rather than thinking about the result. Being in the present is a better option than thinking of the past or worrying about the future."
42	507328	India v West Indies, Group B, World Cup 2011, Chennai	Hanging tough through the trough	Sharda Ugra at the MA Chidambaram Stadium	March 20, 2011	#p#Yuvraj Singh spent the best part of the last year climbing out of a trough. He was dropped from the Test and one-day teams, was struggling with fitness and injury, and found his career crash landing. Had he been younger, Yuvraj once said, he may even have considered giving up the game. Within the course of this last month, he is fast approaching what could become his finest hour as a one-day cricketer. Strangely, that does not even depend on how far the Indian team goes in the World Cup because if India looks around their dressing room to identify its most improved cricketer in 2011, it would have to be him. #p#If the team were to pick their totem for the kind of cricketer they need as their sport's biggest event goes into its most oxygen-depleting stage, it would also have to be Yuvraj again. #p#Other than the opening game, every match won by India at this World Cup has featured their heavy-hitting, loose-limbed, floating middle-order man as Man of the Match. Ireland and Holland may not be the strongest of opposition, but without Yuvraj, India would have floundered, both with runs and wickets. #p#Against West Indies, in the gorgeously renovated Chepauk, India needed an emphatic performance in their last group game, and their 80-run win was led by Yuvraj's first one-day century since July 2009. The century did not contain Yuvraj's signature big shots crashing around the ground like waves on the nearby Marina. It was a slow, long, quiet haul, the hundred buttressed by two dropped catches (at 9 and 13), 45 humble singles, stomach cramps, retching and the dehydrating demands of an intestinal bug. #p#In the latter half of his innings, Yuvraj began to squat on his haunches; the hardships focussed his mind to a point where he found a way to push on. Two sixes in 123 balls is docile by his standards, but he clung onto the big picture: bat till the end. #p#It meant keeping the ball on the ground and making the most of having come in at No. 4. "I wanted to get to the 100 mark because this was the opportunity, batting at no. 4," he said afterwards. He began his media conference by sinking an entire bottle of Gatorade down his throat, and then making wisecracks. At No. 5, Yuvraj said, he never faced enough deliveries to hit his way to three-figures. "I just wanted to bat till the end today... I just wanted to get to the 100 mark, because it's been a while." #p#Yuvraj must look around the dressing room and realise that, in this World Cup, it has been an alarming while since India's middle order has showed up as a collective unit that can build from his singular performances in the tournament. With Sachin Tendulkar walking off early and Virender Sehwag sitting out the West Indies match due to a nagging knee injury, this was the best stage for the next clutch of batsmen - Gautam Gambhir, Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina and the captain MS Dhoni himself - to treat this particular game as a stage on which to make a statement, rather than merely show off their skill. #p#The batting order suited everyone in the line-up; the team didn't have to choose between Raina and Yusuf Pathan in the XI, Gambhir could open, and Kohli could bat at No. 3 and have 49 overs in which to "express" himself. Kohli's two-hour innings, in which he scored 59 off 76 balls, was promising. He built a 122-run partnership in which he gave Yuvraj large swathes of the strike. Yet Kohli's departure, caused by a missed attempt at a cross-batted shot against the probing and incisive Ravi Rampaul, with 18 overs left to play and his older partner visibly struggling, was a moment that makes coaches want to bang their heads in bathrooms. #p#Ever since they battered Bangladesh's bowling attack in Mirpur, India seems to have picked the 40th over as the moment their line-up must go down in spectacular flames. In Mirpur, they added 94 in their last 10 overs for the loss of two wickets. After returning home though, they have gone in the opposite direction. In Bangalore against England, India scored 91 runs for the loss of seven wickets from the 40th to the innings close; against South Africa, they managed 28 for 8, and against West Indies, on Sunday, they got 56 for 7. #p#In the previous three matches, it was believed India had taken the batting Powerplay too early; they took it from the 35th to the 39th over against Bangladesh, from 37 to 41 against England, and 39 to 43 against South Africa. Against West Indies, they left it for the very end, and still it trapped them, as they failed to bat out their full quota of overs. Little appeared to have changed since the weeks post Mirpur, yet one thing did: for the first time since the first match of the World Cup, India won big. #p#Their flailing middle order must now realise they have run out of all room for what the tennis folk call unforced errors. Yuvraj was replying to a question about crowd support, but produced what could be a handy dressing room speech to his middle-order partners going into the knockout phase. "You are playing the World Cup quarter-finals for your country. This is the moment of your life. This is the moment you live for as a cricketer." #p#During his annus horribilius, he said he had hung onto an idea: that tough people outlast tough times. Well, at least now the batting around Yuvraj knows what they need to do to push this team through the World Cup. Be like him. Keep hanging tougher.
42	507329	India v West Indies, World Cup 2011, Chennai	West Indies search for winning feeling	Dileep Premachandran at the MA Chidambaram Stadium	March 20, 2011	#p#In May 2006, after India had edged a close game in Jamaica at the start of the one-day series, Greg Chappell, then the coach, suggested that West Indies had forgotten how to win. It prompted a furious response, and some West Indies players indicated that it had been the inspiration for a rousing comeback that sealed the series 4-1. #p#Those were hardly glory days for West Indies - the subsequent Test series was lost in Kingston - but continuing poor results have meant that even the players have begun to acknowledge that the winning habit is a hazy memory. #p#The task at Chepauk was not a straightforward run chase, especially with no Chris Gayle at the top of the order. But having done the hard work, with Devon Smith particularly impressive in crafting 81, the match was there to be won. When you are 154 for 2, needing less than a run a ball from the last 20 overs, it takes some pretty inept batting to throw it away. #p#Darren Sammy is now as used to answering the collapse question as he is to losing tosses. "We created another opportunity, but couldn't capitalise," he said wearily. "It's a good thing it didn't happen in the knockout stage. If it had, we would be going home. It is worrying for us, but I back the calibre of players that we have." #p#Smith is exempt from criticism, bowled by a beautiful slower delivery from Zaheer Khan, but as India scented an opportunity, West Indies drilled holes instead of plugging leaks. Kieron Pollard, batting with a dislocated finger, went for the glory shot before he'd settled, and Sammy was run out in a comedy of errors involving him, Suresh Raina and Munaf Patel. #p#Those left showed no inclination to take the game to the wire, and Ramnaresh Sarwan's desperate swipe at Zaheer in the batting Powerplay summed up the collective lack of belief. There have been murmurs about the exclusion of Shivnarine Chanderpaul in the last two games, but it's optimistic to see a man averaging 23.33 in the tournament, with a strike-rate of 58.82, as the panacea to batting ills. #p#Ravi Rampaul's five-wicket haul was one of the few positives from the game for West Indies AFP Enlarge #p#Spare a thought for Ravi Rampaul. A benchwarmer until fever ruled Kemar Roach out, he produced a magnificent spell of bowling on a pitch that offered little more than some early bounce. Back in June 2009, when West Indies last beat a top-ranking nation [India, in Jamaica], Rampaul had taken 4 for 37. On Sunday, he topped that with 5 for 51. #p#The reverse-swing special to get rid of a well-set Virat Kohli was eye-catching, as was the yorker with which he nailed Yusuf Pathan. It was yet another reminder to the line-and-length school of coaching that bending your back and bowling genuinely quick comes with its own rewards. #p#Afterwards, Sammy admitted that Rampaul's performance was one of the few things to take away from the defeat. "He has been on the bench, but he's come in and grabbed his opportunity with both hands. That's what you want from your team setup." #p#What you don't want is to give dangerous batsmen too many reprieves. "We got success early on, and could have had Yuvraj [Singh] too," Sammy said. "I was the culprit who dropped him both times." #p#Yuvraj had made just 9 and 13 when those chances went down, and his 122-run partnership with Kohli transformed the game. With Pakistan having played one of their best games of the tournament against Australia, such generosity is likely to be severely punished in Mirpur on Wednesday, when West Indies face them in the first quarter-final. #p#Sammy is well aware of the threat. "Their captain [Shahid Afridi] has been performing, and some of the others have too. Hopefully, they'll have their bad match against us, and we'll bring our A game." #p#It's been a long time since anyone saw it. But as they head to Bangladesh, the players could do worse than ask Richie Richardson, the manager, to tell them about 1996. Then too, West Indies qualified fourth out of their group and were given next to no chance against a rampant South Africa. #p#A Brian Lara epic followed, and Sammy will hope that a fit-again Chris Gayle or a Darren Bravo can emulate him as a once-great side tries to rediscover the winning feeling.
42	507344	India v West Indies, Group B, World Cup 2011, Chennai	Rampaul's 'perfect ball at the perfect time'	ESPNcricinfo staff	March 21, 2011	'The best ball of my cricket career' AFP Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: Ravi Rampaul | Sachin Tendulkar Matches: India v West Indies at Chennai Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: India | West Indies #p#"It was the perfect ball at the perfect time." That's how Ravi Rampaul, the West Indies seamer, described his delivery that got rid of Sachin Tendulkar in the first over in Chennai. Rampaul, in his first World Cup match, went on to take a maiden five-wicket haul in ODIs but his team was at the receiving end of an 80-run defeat. Despite the eventual loss, the five-for, and that delivery, marked a personal highlight for Rampaul. #p#"It was the best ball of my cricket career. It was one of those moments in life you dream of. When I saw him walk I felt great. It was an amazing feeling. I wasn't sure how to celebrate. Here was I, in one of the biggest matches of my career, getting the wicket of one of the greatest batsmen. I felt really great to get such a massive breakthrough for the team," Rampaul said. #p#Rampaul was drafted in to the XI due to an illness to Kemar Roach. He began on an unsavoury note, conceding five wides off his first delivery in World Cup cricket. But off the final ball of that first over, he got a shortish delivery on off stump to straighten, one that Tendulkar stabbed at and ended up feathering an edge to the keeper. Tendulkar walked off immediately after he was caught, even though Steve Davis, the umpire, shook his head. #p#"I was happy to get into the team and play my part. It was very exciting to play in front such a large crowd on such a big stage," Rampaul said. "I went out and got five wickets and I was really happy to get the full support of everyone in the team. I was happy to be able to make the most of my opportunity." #p#Rampaul returned in his next spell to break a century-stand between Virat Kohli and Yuvraj Singh, and continued to chip away in the death overs when India, as they had done against South Africa, collapsed. He finished with 5 for 51. "The pitch had some extra bounce at the start of the India innings and I knew if I got the ball in the right areas I would be successful," he said. "Later in the innings I got the ball to reverse swing and I attacked the stumps. Things went in my favour and I felt good to get my first five-wicket haul in one-day cricket." #p#The defeat for West Indies meant they finished fourth in Group B, setting up a quarter-final clash in Dhaka against Group A leaders Pakistan on March 23.
42	507463			Nandita Jayaraj		Choice of game India are playing, and that's pretty much the only criterion for me to want to go watch a match live. Also, it was in my city, and on a Sunday. So I guess you could say it was pretty much meant to be. I'm the sort of person who's exasperatingly cautious, but as much as I didn't want to jinx our performance by assuming we would win, I couldn't help it. However, I do have immense belief in the fact that our team is known to make things difficult for themselves, and so I also had the tingling feeling that West Indies weren't going to hand us victory on a platter. #p# Team supported I wish I could say I'm a fan of the game, but when India are playing, I want India to win, every single time. And the fact that we're so unpredictable makes me love our team even more. The imperfections are what make Indian cricket so gloriously entertaining. I was quite resigned to the fact that if we lost, it would weaken my will to live at least for a week. #p# World Cup prediction Tough one. I want it to be India, real bad. But I think in a normal, miracle-less world we'll be semi-finalists. In a world with the right balance of realism and miracles, we would be in the final. In a sucky, unlucky world, Australia will dismiss us in the quarter-finals. If we actually win the Cup, it would be a fantastic miracle, yet not an undeserved one. #p# As you can see, for now I am unable to think beyond India's chances. As long as Australia don't win again I'll be okay. And by okay I mean I won't jump off the Chetpet Bridge into the foul Cooum River. #p# Key performer Yuvraj Singh played a patient, practical and painful innings. His fatigue-caused antics were weirdly endearing to me. Also, all the bowlers were amazing. #p# One thing I'd have changed MS Dhoni's innings. I'm an intense Dhoni fan but I think he should have played a little differently. Of course, it's very easy for us to sit in the gallery and judge. I guess I'm just a little miffed we didn't get to see as many fancy shots as we would've liked. #p# Accessories My granddad's Nikon binoculars were a godsend. I saw a lot of things I wouldn't have otherwise, like Stumpy getting stuck at a gate. And other not-as-pleasant sights, like Ramnaresh Sarwan pulling his pants down to adjust something, and Yuvraj throwing up. #p# I just hope the man inside the Stumpy costume got paid enough. #p# Face-off I relished Puppy versus Rest of the World. That puppy changed the game for us when it sprinted onto the field. Suresh Raina and Virat Kohli tried chasing it out but it ran in again and finally settled near the refreshments box. Seven wickets fell in 31 runs soon after. #p# Wow moment Zaheer Khan's wicket of Devon Smith. My friend had just left, thinking we'd lose, and I was pretty bummed. That wicket and the dog brought the madness back to the crowd. #p# Close encounter R Ashwin, pumped at playing his first World Cup match, and after taking first wicket, acknowledged his home crowd behind him. I want to know what the very noticeable, perfectly circular, pink patch, on the back of his pants, was. #p# Shot of the day Yuvraj's six off Darren Sammy. Just when we all thought the mid-field vomiting had done him in #p# Crowd meter The stadium was jam-packed. The air was electric, loud and full of stories, just the way I like it. The crowd was very sporting, and even played along with a seemingly dead emcee who asked us to yell "Yahoo!" Mexican waves spread like wildfire. There's nothing quite like watching the real thing, even with uncomfortable seats and in the heat of the Chennai sun. #p# The sound of 30,000 voices silenced by Sachin Tendulkar's wicket never fails to astound me. One man unites so many diverse people. Hype or not, it's truly something very special. #p# My friend and I walked into the stadium hoping Kieron Pollard or Yusuf Pathan wouldn't kill us with their sixes, but fortunately or not, we didn't have much of those to worry about. #p# Entertainment The entertainment was superb. Of course the energy was already so high you didn't need a DJ to rouse the crowds, but ours did a great job. From the classic Tamil koothu music, to Hindi songs, and Rihanna's hip-hop, there was something to please them all. The crowd went crazy when "Who Let the Dogs Out?" was played right when people were starting to talk about the divine canine intervention. Then there was the customary "Singh is King" for Harbhajan Singh and Yuvraj, but like I said, it doesn't take much to please an Indian crowd watching Indian cricket. #p# ODIs v Twenty20 Twenty20s are easier to watch but ODIs have more soul. #p# Marks out of 10 6 for quality of cricket, 0 for food (tell me, how do curd rice and idlis count as cricket-match food?) , and 10 for everything else. I guess that has a weighted mean of about 9.
42	507501		Tendulkar and the wisdom of walking	Rob Steen	March 24, 2011	Sachin Tendulkar: setting an example AFP Enlarge Related Links News : To walk or not to walk? Match reports : South Africa v England Players/Officials: Sachin Tendulkar Matches: India v West Indies at Chennai Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: India #p#It is possible, just, that this World Cup will produce a more cherishable moment than Sachin Tendulkar's decision to walk against West Indies on Sunday. That said, short of Ricky Ponting offering to ghost-write Aleem Dar's autobiography in exchange for a signed copy of the MCC's Spirit of Cricket , it is fiendishly difficult to see how. #p#Let's be clear about this. Walking is cricket's trickiest ethical dilemma. Always has been, always will be. It marks the intersection of professionalism and honesty, where pragmatism collides with principle. That it should rear its two-faced head again at this tournament is assuredly no coincidence, but more of that later. By way of measuring the delicate nature of this part-time custom, let's rewind to Cape Town, 1965. #p#On the opening day of the third Test, Eddie Barlow, the bulldog atop South Africa's order, survives a vehement England appeal for a catch at short leg, stands his ground, with the tourists convinced that the umpire has erred, and marches on to a century. Still livid, the fielders refuse, pointedly, to applaud, then over-compensate, equally pointedly, when Barlow's partner, Tony Pithey, reaches 50. Mike Smith's side are castigated for making their dissent so plain; one writer claims they descended "to a deplorable level" Smith duly apologises to Barlow, but the furore is merely warming up. #p#When England bat, Ken Barrington, on 44, nudges to short leg, on the bounce. Spinning around, the team joker makes as if to walk off, then returns, grinning. The crowd gets the joke. Shortly afterwards, Barrington edges to the keeper, Denis Lindsay. At first it looks as if he is about to walk, but he stays put. Again, the umpire was John Warner. "I knew I was out," Barrington would recall, "but then I remembered all the chat in the papers about leaving decisions to the umpires." #p#Apparently every bit as confused as Barrington, Warner doesn't flinch. For a few interminable seconds, time and picture freeze, whereupon Barrington walks. "I felt I just couldn't stay there," he later explained. "It was a matter of principle and sportsmanship." Cue applause from fielders and spectators alike, and a fusillade of criticism from journalists - many of them English - who felt Barrington had tarried too long. Unusually, outrage was caused because Barrington did walk. #p#The Rand Daily Mail wondered whether it was "an ostentatious act which bordered on gamesmanship" and urged Barrington to apologise to Warner for subjecting him to "ridicule and contempt" To the Fleet Street Daily Mail , the action "smacked of 'we chaps know how to play the game even if you lot don't'." Barrington apologised. "I can blame my hesitation only on my own indecision," he would reflect. "I got terribly involved in the rights and wrongs of walking." #p#DON'T KID YOURSELF that walking is one of those noble practices that only died out with the advent of global professionalism. WG Grace famously stayed put even when his timbers had been shivered. Between the world wars, claimed Gubby Allen, "few batsmen ever walked unless given out" #p#That period may have accounted for 90% of Wally Hammond's career, but as England's first post-war captain he made Bill Edrich feel so queasy about not walking in an Ashes Test that Edrich promptly surrendered his wicket. Come the 1960s, according to Mike Brearley, non-walkers were considered cheats. In his disarmingly robust diary, Another Day, Another Match , the Gloucestershire seamer Brian Brain confirmed as much: "When I started in county cricket [in 1959], the ones who didn't walk could be counted on the fingers of one hand and they'd be given a huge rocket from their captains if they stood their ground when they knew they were out  [In 1980] I didn't see one batsman walk." All three, though, were referring to county cricket. In Australia it has never been the done thing, the honourable thing, nor even a credible act - hence the disbelief and dressing-room disgruntlement that greeted Adam Gilchrist's celebrated decision to off himself in the 2003 World Cup semi-final. #p#If Tendulkar did act out of fear for what this brave new world might do to his reputation, we should not think any the less of him. What we got was the right result, regardless of how it was arrived at. End fully justified means #p#Nor, for that matter, was walking admired unreservedly in the shires. After all, reasoned Sir Derek Birley in his seminal myth-frying book The Willow Wand , here was a decidedly dodgy, shamelessly class-based and erratically practised custom instigated by amateur captains, who "set their honour code above the authority of the humble umpires" (and Hammond, note, had to turn amateur to captain his country). Unconstrained by social hierarchies or convention, Australians felt no compunction to follow suit. "[It] can be assumed as more likely to take place when a batsman has just made a century than after he has made three successive ducks," theorised Birley with a certain slyness. "It has, in fact, a slightly unreal 'holier than thou' aura." #p#It was refreshing, therefore, to hear Nick Knight, the England opener-turned-affable Sky Sports pundit, admit on Sunday to having been "a convenient walker  a selective walker" He walked if average/form permitted. The late Sir Colin Cowdrey was another "selective" walker. While remembered by many, quite properly, with admiration and fondness, bowlers deplored his wayward ethical compass. #p#Knight's confession came in the wake of Tendulkar's unprompted exit, which went conspicuously un-analysed by the Sky experts (and many others besides). Maybe they were being diplomatic. To question any batsman's motives in such circumstances would fling open a can of worms; to question those of the only active sporting icon with an unstained reputation could lever the lid off a bucket of cobras. The question, nevertheless, is too pressing, too relevant to the game's future, not to be asked. #p#Let's unpack the loaded context. The din in the MA Chidambaram Stadium was shrill and deafening; umpire Steve Davis would have been hard-pushed to hear any edge, let alone an inside tickle. Nor, even after multiple TV replays, was it clear that Ravi Rampaul's inducker had kissed Tendulkar's bat. Small wonder the appeal triggered a stately shake of the head from Davis, who looks more like the Buddha's younger, fitter brother with each passing match, and seems to have inherited the family wisdom. #p#One assumes Tendulkar knew he'd nicked it, but when the appeal was rejected he didn't go all Hamlet on us like Barrington; he was decisive, off in a flash. Yet what, one couldn't help but wonder, had sped through his mind during the interregnum separating shot and Davis' slo-mo shake? Was he mulling Ricky Ponting's extraordinary look of innocence after being adjudged caught-behind against Pakistan 24 hours earlier, a decision that my children's cat's grandmother could have made? Did Tendulkar feel Ponting should have walked? Does he believe the game's elders should be setting an example? Why not? #p#But might he also have been pondering the Decision Review System? Tendulkar has often expressed reservations about this latest contentious innovation (a major factor in the BCCI's distaste towards it, presumably); and now, lo and behold, the damned thing was in a position to put his image on the line. David Gower summed up one of the less-heralded by-products of the DRS with typical succinctness and delicacy after Michael Clarke walked during last November's Brisbane Ashes Test: "There's less incentive to stay." And after Clarke declined to walk in Adelaide, putting struggling team before ego and/or gallantry, he was palpably embarrassed and quick to tweet a public apology. Without the DRS, would he have been so remorseful? #p#The next question, to some, is the most damning: did Tendulkar act out of pragmatism rather than nobility? Did he weigh up the options? He must have known, had he stood his ground, that a review, even as early as the first over, would have been eminently likely. And what might that have unearthed? That ball had eluded edge? With no HotSpot on tap, why not? Or would it have showed that he, Sachin Tendulkar, the most pandemically respected sportsman of them all, an untouchable idol to billions, had tried, like that rogue Ponting, to get away with it? #p#And what of the umpire when a batsman walks? Getty Images Enlarge #p#This is not meant to decry Tendulkar; anything but. Since when is being human a sin? Like Barrington and Gilchrist, he waited for the umpire's ruling. Perhaps he and Gilchrist (if not Barrington) did so not to buy themselves time but out of respect for the adjudicator's sensitivities. None of this, though, should undermine the underlying message: if the DRS can make umpires look fallible, even incompetent, it can also make players look foolish at best, at worst dishonest. And if Tendulkar did act out of fear for what this brave new world might do to his reputation, we should not think any the less of him. What we got was the right result, regardless of how it was arrived at. End fully justified means. #p#Soon after Ted Dexter was appointed chairman of the England selectors, in 1989, he claimed that the public, in addition to "heroic deeds", craved "chivalrous conduct" If this was a remarkable and fruitless thing to say then, such romanticism is even harder to come by now. All the same, is a PhD in naivety the only prerequisite for concluding that the DRS is awakening something much more desirable than chivalry - namely honesty? #p#Unfortunately there may be a sobering epilogue, and a deeply ironic one at that. Sunday's episode might persuade Tendulkar to harden his stance against the DRS, in which case, such is his sway, the game's strongest incentive for honesty could well die a premature death. Let's hope this was his Damascene moment.
43	507514	Pakistan v West Indies, World Cup 2011, 1st quarter-final, Mirpur	Pakistan's bowling variety allows extra batsman	Osman Samiuddin in Mirpur	March 22, 2011	Umar Gul is the form fast bowler in the world Associated Press Enlarge Related Links News : Pakistan mull including Ajmal Players/Officials: Shahid Afridi | Umar Gul Matches: Pakistan v West Indies at Dhaka Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Pakistan | West Indies #p#Through their unexpectedly smooth progress to the quarter-finals, the one question that has been asked of Pakistan repeatedly has been about the balance of the side. The Akmal brothers and Shoaib Akhtar hijacked matters temporarily, but the only on-field issue has been whether Pakistan have been playing a specialist bowler short to guard against the insecurities about its batting. #p#On the surface, much of the uneasiness about the combination is an instinctive, intangible one, a knee-jerk reaction to years of Pakistan sides geared around the bowling. No Pakistan team ever plays a bowler short, do they? It gives this combination initially a defensive feel, designed to make sure they can cover the weaknesses in their batting by taking from the strength of their bowling. And Pakistan play best when they are the aggressor, when they have specialists doing what specialists are meant to do. #p#In the loss to New Zealand, when Abdul Razzaq, Shoaib and Abdur Rehman bowled the last four, pivotal overs, the folly of this strategy came through. Chasing 300-plus subsequently, it wouldn't have made a difference whether they had six, seven or eleven batsmen in the side. Razzaq, who is a vital but underused component of this strategy, made a half-century at No 8, an effort lost on the game. #p#But after the win against Australia, a revision was in order and the true intent of what Pakistan have been trying to do seeped through. The comfort of Razzaq at eight was, after all, designed precisely for the kind of small innings he played against Australia, an unbeaten 20 that soothed frayed nerves. More tellingly, his two wickets earlier in the day meant Pakistan's attack looked just as Pakistan's attack is meant to look. #p#Though not conclusive either way, five wins in six games means the dilemma doesn't matter so much right now. And it matters even less because the attack they have played with, a bowler short or not, has actually done so well. "The way our boys have bowled in this competition has been amazing," Shahid Afridi said, with some justification ahead of Wednesday's quarter-final in Mirpur with West Indies. "All the credit [for our progress] goes to them for that. [Umar] Gul, Rehman, [Mohammad] Hafeez, Razzaq all have been bowling very well, Wahab [Riaz] as well." #p#They are joint-third on the list of team wicket-takers in the tournament, behind South Africa and India and equal with their quarter-final opponents. But for a rain-curtailed game against Zimbabwe, in which they bowled less than 40 overs, they would likely be higher. They also have the top wicket-taker and joint-fourth top wicket-taker of the competition in Afridi and Gul; the latter is the form paceman currently in the world. #p#But for variety, they are unmatched. In the first-choice XI they have played in the previous two games, they have every modern-day bowling option you can imagine. They have a right-arm fast bowler, a left-arm fast bowler (and both are fast, not fast-medium or some such dilution), a left-arm spinner, an offspinner, a legspinner, a right-arm medium-pacer; save for the chinaman, each and every angle is covered here. They have new ball wicket-takers, old ball reverse-swingers, death-over specialists, choking spinners through the middle, attacking ones through the same. #p#Just in case of injury or form, they have Shoaib's pace, Saeed Ajmal's off-spin and Junaid Khan's left-arm angle as back-up. So well-stocked have they been with options, they've even opened with spin, something they hadn't done in 13 years before this, and with some success. #p#And Razzaq apart, each and every one of them have done precisely what they have been asked to, and done it consistently. Hafeez has bowled nearly six overs a game and been miserly (only 4.08 runs per over conceded). He's picked up big wickets regularly, including Ricky Ponting and Upul Tharanga in the two biggest group games. Rehman has gone for only 4.42 an over, building a hurried and sustained pressure at one end. #p#These are the sweats, not the glory-seekers. #p#With this kind of choice, each bowling change Afridi makes has ensured that batsmen are unable to fall into the kind of rhythm they thrive on. Each change has brought a change of pace, a change of angle, a change in the degrees of turn to account for; in short, a different challenge. #p#On the pitches of the subcontinent, that is often a winning ploy.
43	507520	Pakistan v West Indies, World Cup 2011, 1st quarter-final, Mirpur	Battle of two inconsistent batting line-ups	Madhusudhan Ramakrishnan	March 22, 2011	Pakistan's varied bowling attack, led by the irrepressible Shahid Afridi, is their greatest strength Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Matches: Pakistan v West Indies at Dhaka Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Pakistan | West Indies Grounds: Shere Bangla National Stadium #p#Despite there being few doubts about Pakistan qualifying for the knockout stages, their top position in the group stages has come as a bit of a surprise. Their performances over the years have always been characterised by sheer unpredictability, which makes them a formidable opponent on any given day. As per their seeding, Pakistan were expected to finish behind Australia and Sri Lanka, and beat New Zealand. But what happened was quite the opposite. They pulled off stunning wins over Sri Lanka and Australia, ending the latter's 34-match unbeaten streak in World Cups. However, they lost heavily against New Zealand after an inept batting and bowling performance. West Indies, who were expected to face stern tests against Bangladesh and the other two lower-ranked teams, comfortably triumphed in the three matches. They bowled Bangladesh out for just 58 in Mirpur and went on to ensure their qualification for the next round. What has been less inspiring is their performance against the top teams. While they were not expected to topple India, England or South Africa, they have had their chances in all three teams and failed to grab them. #p#Pakistan better against top teams West Indies have been more ruthless than Pakistan in the matches against the lower-ranked teams. They beat Netherlands by 215 runs and thrashed Bangladesh in Mirpur by nine wickets. Pakistan, on the other hand, comfortably got past Zimbabwe and Kenya, but fell for 184 against Canada before eventually defending the score with some disciplined bowling. In matches played against lower-ranked teams, West Indies have the better average and run-rate difference. The story is very different against the top teams. West Indies have a poorer bowling average and economy rate than Pakistan. West Indies, who have chased and lost on two out of three occasions against top teams, might prefer to bat first and post a big score against Pakistan, who floundered in a big chase against New Zealand. In 1996, fourth-placed West Indies faced top-ranked South Africa in the quarter-finals and pulled off an incredible win defending 264, which was set up by a stunning century by Brian Lara. One of their batsmen will have to stand up and deliver a similar emphatic performance for them to upstage Pakistan. #p#Pakistan and West Indies in the World Cup 2011 so far Team Opposition Runs per wicket(batting) Run rate Runs per wicket(bowling) Economy rate Average diff RR diff Pakistan Test-playing teams 28.13 4.87 28.61 5.07 -0.48 -0.20 West Indies Test-playing teams 21.16 4.69 31.91 5.21 -10.75 -0.52 Pakistan non Test-playing teams and Bangladesh 33.25 5.22 14.85 3.46 18.40 1.76 West Indies non Test-playing teams and Bangladesh 34.94 5.91 13.46 4.06 21.48 1.85 #p#Batting woes for both teams Pakistan and West Indies have finished top and bottom of their respective groups, but the batting performances of both teams have been inconsistent. In the match against Sri Lanka, Pakistan's batting came good and enabled them to post an excellent score of 277 which they defended successfully. Against Australia, Pakistan's brittle batting was nearly exposed while chasing a modest 176. New Zealand, however, thoroughly exploited the weaknesses in Pakistan's top order, by reducing them to 23 for 4 in pursuit of 303, from which Pakistan never recovered. Pakistan's top order has been unconvincing except for Asad Shafiq, who top-scored against Zimbabwe and Australia. Their middle order has been doing much better, but is likely to be severely tested if faced with a competitive target and quality bowling attack. #p#West Indies' problems have been quite the opposite. Strong starts in almost every game have been frittered away and incredible middle order collapses have meant that they have finished well short. After the early loss of Chris Gayle against South Africa, they recovered and looked set to reach a score of 280 before a flurry of wickets in the end kept them down to just 222. Gayle provided an explosive start against England but again the middle order failed to capitalise. In their final group game against India, West Indies lost their last eight wickets for just 34 runs and lost by 80 runs after being in a comfortable position in their chase of 269. #p#Batting stats of top order and middle order of teams Team Batting position Average Strike rate 100s 50s Pakistan Top order (1-3) 24.70 69.19 0 2 West Indies Top order (1-3) 42.62 81.87 1 4 Pakistan Middle order (4-8) 33.68 81.69 0 6 West Indies Middle order (4-8) 19.80 86.08 0 2 #p#Powerplay performances reflect batting worries The consistent batting performance of the top order of West Indies is clearly reflected in the stats in the mandatory and bowling Powerplays. Their batting average and run rate are much higher than Pakistan's in the same phase of the innings. However, Pakistan have been the more incisive and economical bowling team in the first ten overs. The powerful lower-middle order of Pakistan has scored at a run rate close of 9.81 in the batting Powerplay. In the same period, though, West Indies have been unable to create an impact as a result of major middle-order collapses. #p#Performance of the teams in the Powerplays Team Innings phase RR Batting Average ER Bowling average Run rate diff Dot-ball percentage Boundary percentage Pakistan Mandatory Powerplay (overs 1-10) 4.41 21.33 3.66 19.85 0.75 78.16 58.59 West Indies Mandatory Powerplay (overs 1-10) 5.13 61.60 4.63 27.50 0.50 66.94 60.38 Pakistan Bowling Powerplay 3.58 34.66 4.50 33.75 -0.92 67.81 26.92 West Indies Bowling Powerplay 5.24 131.00 4.30 25.80 0.94 54.66 44.27 Pakistan Batting Powerplay 9.81 52.33 6.00 11.28 3.81 38.54 62.42 West Indies Batting Powerplay 8.00 23.33 6.07 9.75 1.93 46.66 62.85 #p#The batting for both teams has been a let down in the tournament so far. Not surprisingly, Devon Smith is the only batsman from both teams to figure in the top 20 run-getters in the tournament so far. Kieron Pollard and Gayle have been good on occasions, but will need to step up if West Indies are to challenge the top teams in the knockout games. Not a single Pakistan batsman figures among the top 20 run-getters with Umar Akmal coming in much later on the list with 211 runs. #p#Pakistan the better balanced bowling side Shahid Afridi, the most successful bowler in the World Cup with 17 wickets, could be a huge threat to West Indies, given that they haven't been comfortable against spin. Umar Gul and Abdul Razzaq found form against Australia, and the right blend of pace and spin gives Pakistan a bowling edge over most teams. Pakistan's pace bowlers have been more impressive against right-handers, though, and the presence of a number of left-hand batsmen in the top order of West Indies could be a test for Pakistan's bowlers. #p#The West Indies pace attack has been quite a revelation all through, with Kemar Roach and Andre Russell being the pick of the bowlers. Ravi Rampaul also impressed with a five-wicket haul against India, and could get another game despite the return of Roach. Devendra Bishoo has been quite economical in the two games he has played, while Sulieman Benn did well in Mirpur against Bangladesh. Like Pakistan's attack, West Indies' bowlers have also relished bowling to right-handers. #p#Performance of pace bowlers and spinners against right handers and left handers Type of Bowler Type of Batsman Average ER Pakistan (pace) RHB 21.59 22 Pakistan (pace) LHB 29.66 4.20 West Indies (pace) RHB 16.04 4.95 West Indies (pace) LHB 26.66 4.48 Pakistan (spin) RHB 21.19 3.74 West Indies (spin) LHB 19.84 4.52 Pakistan (spin) RHB 19.42 5.62 West Indies (spin) LHB 53.00 5.18 #p#Even record in recent times In recent head-to-head clashes in global tournaments, the teams have been evenly matched. Pakistan won by five wickets in their most recent meeting in the Champions Trophy while West Indies won comfortably in their last World Cup meeting in the opening game of the 2007 World Cup. West Indies have an 8-3 record in global tournaments against Pakistan. Since 1999 though, both teams have won two games each when they have met in the World Cup and Champions Trophy. Overall, in matches played since 2000, Pakistan enjoy a much better record. #p#Mirpur, the venue for the match, has generally been a good batting wicket, but stats here are distorted because of the two batting failures by Bangladesh, when they were bowled out for 58 and 78 against West Indies and South Africa respectively. In recent games teams chasing have done much better in Mirpur, but in a crucial knockout game batting first might be the better option.
43	507527	Pakistan v West Indies, World Cup 2011, 1st quarter-final, Mirpur	Pakistan mull including Ajmal	Osman Samiuddin in Mirpur	March 22, 2011	#p#Pakistan's resolve to not change a winning XI will undergo a stiff test ahead of the quarter-final against West Indies in Dhaka on Wednesday. Pakistan, who won five out of six games to top Group A, were fairly settled - by their standards - through that run. Only after five failures did they tweak the opening combination and injuries apart, Shoaib Akhtar represents the only other unforced change in personnel. #p#But with the possibility of as many as four left-handers in the West Indies top five - if Shivnarine Chanderpaul returns to shore up a middle order prone to collapse - Pakistan will consider the option of using Saeed Ajmal to off-set that. #p#The decision will not be an easy one. If Ajmal does play, he is likely to do so in place of Abdur Rehman. The left-arm spinner has played a quiet but significant role in Pakistan's campaign so far, opening the bowling in two of their last three games; though he has only three wickets in five games, he has been crucial in stifling opposition run-rates. Additionally, Pakistan feel safer in the knowledge that Rehman is useful - no more - with the bat and a capable, energetic fielder. #p#Afridi, as he has done all along, spoke of the need to not change the XI that beat Australia. "I'm very happy with my winning combination at this stage," he said. "You can't make changes if you can help it for a game like this. We have an offspinner in Mohammad Hafeez so let's see. We'll decide this evening once we've seen the conditions and the pitch." #p#Privately, however, the team management has acknowledged that Ajmal is under consideration, though the decision will be taken after a team meeting on Tuesday evening. Ajmal has been a peripheral figure so far in Pakistan's campaign, playing only in the game against Canada in which Rehman sat out with a leg injury. He bowled well enough in the game, picking up a wicket, though not perhaps well enough to change a situation which has seen him gradually lose the top spinner's slot over the last six months or so. #p#Which of these three will play Wednesday's quarter-final? AFP Enlarge #p#Several sides have used off-spin to open against the West Indies top order through the tournament and with success. Chris Gayle, who is likely to be back tomorrow, fell to Johan Botha in the first over of the game against the West Indies. England used Graeme Swann in the game at Chennai and though he didn't strike early, the success he eventually had, along with James Tredwell, in the game makes the case for Ajmal stronger. R Ashwin opened for India in the last game the West Indies played and he struck early as well. #p#Whatever the line-up ultimately - and that would be the only likely change - Pakistan will go into the game with some confidence after the streak-breaking win against Australia in Colombo. The team arrived in Dhaka early Monday evening and had their first and only practice session at the Shere Bangla Stadium before the game, on Tuesday. #p#"To win a game against a side like Australia before the quarter-final is a big achievement," Afridi said. "The dressing-room atmosphere is very positive and very good. It was a great win. We really worked hard before this tournament and I don't think in my 14-year career we've ever worked as hard. Definitely, the expectation is greater now. We are feeling more confident." #p#Even though the West Indies lost their last two group games and haven't beaten a top side in an ODI since June 2009, Afridi was aware of the threat some of the relatively newer faces may pose. "These young guys are doing a great job. They have performed well, their bowling is good and that is why they are in the quarter-final. They have a very good unit, so we're not taking any team lightly especially at this stage." #p#A win on Wednesday would lead to a first World Cup semi-final since 1999, but the fifth straight ICC event - including the World Twenty20 - in which they've made the last four. "Before this World Cup I said I see my team in the semi-final and I want to see them there. My team is capable of doing that."

Shoaib Akhtar's international career could finish in Mirpur on Wednesday Associated Press Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: Shivnarine Chanderpaul | Chris Gayle | Andre Russell | Shahid Afridi | Umar Gul Matches: Pakistan v West Indies at Dhaka Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Pakistan | West Indies #p#The Big Picture The last time West Indies were in Dhaka, they couldn't have been in more of a rush to get away - in every sense. First there was their on-field performance, as clinical as anything ever witnessed in a World Cup encounter, as a potentially awkward tussle with Bangladesh was done and dusted in barely 30 overs of one-sided action. #p#Then, however, came the darker aspect of the day's events. As the West Indies team bus pulled out of the Shere Bangla stadium, it was pelted with rocks by an irate section of the Bangladeshi support - in the mistaken belief, it was later reported, that their own defeated countrymen were on board. Chris Gayle's alarmed tweet buzzed around the world in minutes, and though the team was later garlanded with flowers by an apologetic supporters' group, the lack of amusement was tangible. "Is it ok for me to say thank god I left bangladesh???!!!" added Sulieman Benn once the team had departed for India. #p#But now they are back, amid drum-tight security, and while the venue may not be to their liking, the opportunity could hardly be more alluring. Of all the teams in a tricky Group B, arguably no-one had a smoother on-field run to the quarter-finals than West Indies. Unlike England, whose struggles against the lesser teams turned every one of their subsequent games into nailbiters, the Windies took the polar opposite approach. They won the games in which they were favourites with such ease - with only the Irish coming close to giving them a scare in a 44-run defeat - that back-to-back defeats against England and India couldn't rattle their rock-solid Net Run Rate. #p#As a consequence they may start as underdogs in the knock-outs, but West Indies have landed the opponents that most suit their hot-and-cold style. Pakistan surpassed expectations to finish top of Group A, and in doing so they bookended the single most remarkable statistic in World Cup history - Australia's 34-match unbeaten run that began in the wake of a Moin Khan-inspired 10-run defeat at Headingley in 1999, and came to an end at the hands of Umar Akmal in Colombo on Saturday. But as their remarkable defeat against the apparent weaklings of New Zealand demonstrated, there's never any point in predicting predictability from Pakistan. #p#The other three quarter-finals involve clear favourites, and it would be a shock if any of India, South Africa and Sri Lanka failed to advance to the semis. This one, however, is anyone's game. On form, Pakistan should shade it, and a potential semi-final date with India in Mohali will ensure their resolve is at its sharpest. But as West Indies showed on their last trip to Mirpur, when they get on a roll they have players who can prove unstoppable. #p#Form guide (completed matches, most recent first) #p#Pakistan WWLWW West Indies LLWWW #p#Watch out for... #p#In their Chennai defeat against England, West Indies threw punch after punch to leave their opponents weak at the knees, but they lacked the subtlety in between whiles to make their position count. Nevertheless, the star of their show was undoubtedly the 22-year-old Andre Russell , whose performance with bat and ball could and should have been the decisive factor. His energetic seamers claimed career-best figures of 4 for 49, and he followed that up with a rough-diamond 49 from 46 balls. In a contest that could be decided by individual brilliance, he has two strings with which to make his bow. #p#Pakistan have long cultivated a reputation as mercurial performers, but scarcely a match goes by these days without a command performance from Umar Gul. He's picked off 13 wickets in his six outings in this World Cup, including nine in the past three games, in which time he has been promoted to new-ball status as well. His effortless variations provide a threat at any stage of an innings, but never more so than at the death when his pinpoint yorkers can prove unhittable. With Chris Gayle at the top of West Indies' order, and Kieron Pollard lurking at the bottom, his ten overs could prove instrumental in deciding the course of the match. #p#Team news #p#Chris Gayle and Kemar Roach are expected to slot straight back into the team after missing the India fixture, in place of Kirk Edwards and Ravi Rampaul, who will count himself unlucky to miss out after picking up figures of 5 for 51 in that match. There could also be a recall for the veteran Shiv Chanderpaul, who was dropped after a tally of 70 runs in four matches at the start of the tournament, but whose experience in such a crunch fixture could be invaluable. Ramnaresh Sarwan is the likeliest man to miss out, although Devon Thomas could conceivably hand the keeping duties to Darren Bravo. #p#West Indies (possible) 1 Chris Gayle, 2 Devon Smith, 3 Darren Bravo, 4 Shivnarine Chanderpaul, 5 Kieron Pollard, 6 Darren Sammy (capt.), 7 Devon Thomas (wk), 8 Andre Russell, 9 Sulieman Benn, 10 Kemar Roach, 11 Devendra Bishoo. #p#Chanderpaul's return would mean four left-handers in West Indies' top five, and so the offspin of Saeed Ajmal is being seriously considered in place of the effective but unassuming left-arm spinner Abdur Rehman. Shoaib Akhtar, with his retirement imminent, will hope to earn a recall in place of Wahab Riaz, who was expensive against Australia, but the variation offered by his left-arm line is not an asset that Shahid Afridi would wish to dispense with in a hurry. #p#Pakistan (possible) 1 Kamran Akmal (wk), 2 Mohammad Hafeez, 3 Asad Shafiq, 4 Younis Khan, 5 Misbah-ul-Haq, 6 Umar Akmal, 7 Shahid Afridi (capt), 8 Abdul Razzaq, 9 Saeed Ajmal, 10 Umar Gul, 11 Wahab Riaz. #p#Pitch and conditions Darren Sammy reckons the Dhaka wicket looks like "a cricket pitch", which is just as well really. Still, Bangladesh managed to make it look like a minefield on West Indies' last visit to the venue, as Sammy, Roach and Benn routed their opponents for 58 in 18.5 overs. There is some grass on the surface, but it ought to be full of runs, as Virender Sehwag demonstrated during his 175 in the opening match of the tournament. The weather is set to be humid, with some prospect of dew in the second innings. #p#Stats and trivia #p#West Indies have won 64 of their 114 ODIs against Pakistan , but just two of the past 13 completed matches, dating back to January 2005. #p#Shahid Afridi's highest score in four World Cup campaigns is 37 against Zimbabwe in June 1999. However, he has claimed 17 of his 24 wickets in the current tournament. #p#West Indies are bidding to reach their fifth World Cup semi-final, and their first since 1996.

Mohammad Hafeez starred with bat and ball, beginning West Indies' decline with two early wickets then ending it with a brisk 61, while Shahid Afridi is proving an inspirational force and led from the front again with four more scalps as the spinners produced a ruthless display to dismantle West Indies for 112. #p#Between the three of them, Pakistan's slow bowlers had figures of 27.3-5-64-8 and gave another example of how there is a threat from every part of the attack. At no point did Afridi need to fill overs, especially when the weakest link of the bowlers - Hafeez - managed to take 2 for 16 in his full allocation. Hafeez then dominated an unbroken opening stand with Kamran Akmal which wiped off the target with barely an alarm and 29 overs to spare. #p#The match represented a contest for as long as Chris Gayle was in the middle - the sum total of 2.5 overs. His departure sucked the life and belief from West Indies line-up with the rest remaining rooted to the crease, managing just seven fours and a solitary Shivnarine Chanderpaul six as he nudged his way to a hollow, unbeaten 44. #p#Some early aggression had proved the falsest of dawns. Devon Smith cut the first ball of the match to the point boundary and Gayle played two thumping shots, but in attempting his third boundary, he picked out Afridi at mid-off who did well to hold on to a stinging drive. With their talisman gone, West Indies became virtually scoreless. #p#Hafeez, handed the new ball after Abdur Rehman was left out, caused a host of problems for the left handers, mainly with his straighter deliveries, rather than any turn. The major damage came in his third over as he skidded one past Smith's inside edge, and three balls later, a similar delivery removed Darren Bravo as he thrust his pad down the line. #p#The next six overs brought just six runs as Ramnaresh Sarwan and Chanderpaul were rendered scoreless by the combination of Hafeez and Gul. The shackles were momentarily broken when Sarwan collected two boundaries off Wahab Riaz - the second a flowing cover drive - but they were the rare exception. #p#Hafeez was allowed to bowl eight overs for 12 runs though he was barely turning the ball and spinners continued to cause problems when Afridi had two close shouts for lbw in his first over. He used up a review with the first one but should have broken through in his second over when Gul didn't accept a chance at long-off when Sarwan, on 14, tried to go over the top. #p#Runs came at a painful rate, but at least the fourth-wicket pair were trying to set a platform. However, with the pressure building and Pakistan racing through the overs Sarwan felt he had to try some shots, but couldn't clear cover as he cut a delivery which bounced more than expected. Not for the first time, Afridi stood with arms aloft and it was just the start for the Pakistan captain. #p#Kieron Pollard did nothing to end the argument that he's a bully of weak bowling attacks when he bottom-edged a cut and Kamran Akmal's recent improvements continued with a sharp take. None of the West Indian batsman - barring Chanderpaul - had a clue which way Afridi was turning the ball and that was summed up by Devon Thomas' dismissal as he played back to a quicker ball. #p#From legspin to offspin it was then the turn of Saeed Ajmal to make more lower-order batsmen look foolish. Darren Sammy, who will struggle to justify his place in the team after this tournament, was turned square by a perfect doosra and the same delivery also removed Devendra Bishoo although this time the batsman helped with an inside edge. #p#Kemar Roach showed some of his team-mates that batting wasn't impossible as he accompanied Chanderpaul for 15 overs to add 40 but it was like trying to the plug the leak in the Titanic. Roach eventually chipped to midwicket and the innings ended with more than six overs remaining when Ravi Rampaul was bowled round his legs by Afridi. #p#Pakistan weren't going to ease their way to the target and after two overs had 25 on the board - it had taken West Indies until the 12th over to reach that point. Hafeez rode on the confidence of his bowling display, but some of the bowling served up was as bad as the earlier batting. A couple of tough half chances were spilled without affecting the result. #p#The victory means their first journey to India since 2007 to face either the co-hosts or defending champions in Mohali. Pakistan won't care who the opposition are, it will take an exceptional performance to stop them.

If Australia beat India, it'll be their seventh semi-final. #p#Pakistan notched up a ten-wicket win for only the third time in ODIs. It was their first in a World Cup game, and their first against West Indies. For West Indies too, this was their first ten-wicket drubbing in a World Cup game and against Pakistan. Overall, it's only the fourth time they've been beaten by ten wickets. The margin in terms of balls left in the second innings is also the third-largest for West Indies. #p#West Indies generally struggled against spin in this tournament, and that problem came to the fore again today against a Pakistan attack which had three quality spinners. In the 27.3 overs they bowled, Mohammad Hafeez, Shahid Afridi and Saeed Ajmal returned combined figures of 8 for 64. Overall in this tournament, West Indies had much poorer numbers against spin than they did against the fast and medium-pace bowlers. #p#West Indies against pace and spin in World Cup 2011 Runs Dismissals Average Run rate Pace 831 23 35.30 5.33 Spin 580 32 17.50 4.03 #p#Only twice have West Indies been bowled out for less than 112 in a World Cup - their lowest total remains 93 against Kenya in 1996. In their three lowest totals, Shivnarine Chanderpaul has top-scored in two, and been the second-highest scorer in the third. #p#West Indies' ten-over score of 18 is the second-lowest in the tournament so far, next only to Canada's 14 for 3 against Zimbabwe. In those ten overs, West Indies played out 52 dot balls, and managed only three fours and five singles. #p#Afridi's 4 for 30 is his fourth haul of four or more wickets in this tournament, which is by far the most in a single World Cup. #p#Hafeez's spell of 2 for 16 in ten overs is the most economical by a bowler who's bowled at least five overs in this World Cup. Among those who've bowled ten overs, the next best is 23 runs, by George Dockrell against Bangladesh, and by Shahid Afridi against Canada. #p#Chanderpaul and Ramnaresh Sarwan both finished with strike rates of less than 60.

He was offered a delivery that was a little shorter and a little wider than Umar Gul would have intended and he unleashed the square cut. It flew, razor sharp off his bat, past point and gave the West Indies a boundary. Smith's stance, tall, upright and authoritative, indicated that the West Indies meant business. It's a pity that the team's actions after that, didn't follow through. #p#Bail-breaking of the day #p#For years the cricket world has scratched its head collectively when Shivnarine Chanderpaul has come to the crease and taken guard. Off comes the bail, to be hammered senselessly into the spot where he takes guard with the top of the bat handle. Other West Indians, most notably Ramnaresh Sarwan, have started following suit. The ferocity with which they hammer the bail in, it's surprising what happened today hasn't happened before: Ronnie was hammering away in the 4th over of the innings, when the bail actually broke. Last we heard, the ICC hadn't sent out a code of conduct disciplinary breach notice for violence against cricket equipment. #p#Over of the day #p#There was little surprise when Saeed Ajmal was picked in the XI today to counter West Indies' battery of left-handers. There was probably more at the decision to open not with him but with Mohammad Hafeez, though he has long been a clever Powerplay operator. He began tightly against a restless Chris Gayle but the pressure he built in the first two overs told in his third. Devon Smith was so plumb he decided not to review it. Three balls later, Darren Bravo went lbw and though he was probably right to refer it, the decision went against him. A double-wicket maiden set the tone for the rest of the innings. #p#Referral of the day #p#No one is ever more convinced in asking for a fielding referral than Shahid Afridi. Off his own bowling he often doesn't even ask anyone else, like the wicketkeeper, for an opinion, making the T-sign a part of his appeal. He asked for one today, a leg-before against Sarwan, which went against him but the best was a cheeky request for a referral to Billy Bowden after a leg-side wide was given in the 27th over of the innings. #p#The mini-scare of the day #p#Near the middle of the innings break, just as twilight was approaching, the time when lights are most needed to bridge the gap between day and night, the floodlights at the Shere-e-Bangla stadium went off. At the same time, a message appeared on the scoreboard "In the event that this match is not completed today, the players will return tomorrow. Please retain your tickets." With the ground swiftly descending into darkness, some fans may have been searching for their tickets, crumpled up in their pockets or bags somewhere, just in case the lights never came back on. A few minutes later, the globes started twinkling again and the field was bathed in light in time for the second innings. #p#The one-handed slip dropper of the day #p#Younis Khan was made to practice his reaction time at first slip. First, was when Saeed Ajmal got Darren Sammy to get a leading edge off a regular offspinner. Younis put in a solid dive to his left and even got a hand on the ball but couldn't hold on. Nine overs later he was tested again. This time by Wahab Riaz's attempt to dismiss Kemar Roach. Riaz angled one across the West Indian quick, who tried to steer it past slip. Younis dived to his right this time and got fingertips to it but the catch evaded him again. He did make up later with a nicely-judged catch at short midwicket to send back Roach.
43	507689	Pakistan v West Indies, World Cup 2011, 1st quarter-final, Mirpur	Gibson blasts senior batsmen	Firdose Moonda at Shere Bangla stadium	March 23, 2011	#p#When Chris Gayle holed out to Shahid Afridi at mid-off in the third over, it summed up the performance of the senior players in the West Indies squad at this World Cup: listless, disinterested and uninspiring. #p#"Our senior players have not performed and I am not especially happy with them," West Indies coach Ottis Gibson said at the post-match press conference. "Our main batsmen haven't performed consistently. We need some senior guys who have the hunger and the desire. We need to look at someone like Sachin Tendulkar who is the senior statesman of the Indian team, and goes out and gets runs almost every time." #p#It seemed that Gibson's statements were directed at Gayle and Ramnaresh Sarwan, both of whom have disappointed in the tournament. Gayle missed two matches through injury and scored 170 runs in the five innings he played, with 90 of those runs coming from four knocks. The other 80 runs came in one innings against Netherlands, which is where he looked most like the Gayle of old - the one that can take a bowling attack and make it dance to his tune. Sarwan fared worse, totalling 155 runs in seven innings and not crossing the half-century mark once. He looked uncomfortable at the crease and failed to conjure up the shots he once used to. #p#It's premature to imagine that these two, and some of the other older players like Shivnarine Chanderpaul, will disappear after this tournament, but Gibson was harsh on them and indicated that there could be an overhaul in the near future. He did not go as far as saying they would be wholesale axing, saying that it is "hard to say whether they [the senior players] had played their last game." #p#West Indies cricket for the last 10 years has been pretty much the same and we've had the same players #p#He did indicate that he felt growth was urgent and necessary if West Indies are serious about rebuilding, especially because "West Indies cricket for the last 10 years has been pretty much the same and we've had the same players." #p#With their next assignment, a series against Pakistan at home, only a month away, Gibson said that the analysis and change will have to come quickly. "There is not much time until the Pakistan series and there are serious decisions to be made, decisions about players, in that time." Gibson seems hopeful that some of the younger members of the squad will be able to make those decisions easier for him by building on the intent they have shown here. "This tournament has seen the emergence of some young players and those are the players that we will build our future on." #p#Ramnaresh Sarwan had a poor World Cup, making 155 runs at 25.83 with no half-centuries Associated Press Enlarge #p#Darren Bravo, who also only had one innings of note, 73 against South Africa, may fit into that mould, as will allrounder Andre Russell and legspinner Devendra Bishoo, who impressed for Guyana before making his debut at the World Cup. Gisbon hopes that a combination of promising new players will be able to complement the more experienced set. "It's not going to happen just with youngsters. We have to balance between the young guys being able to rely on the senior guys and the senior guys mentoring the young guys." #p#The winds of change could find themselves blowing through West Indies but one direction they are unlikely to go in is in the way of the captain. Darren Sammy has had calls for his head since he took over and they intensified at this World Cup, because his inclusion in the starting XI meant no place for Russell. Sammy has been a charismatic leader off the field but a relatively inept one on it. #p#Gibson, nonetheless, gave the captain his backing, especially because of the circumstances under which Sammy took over. He was named captain last October, after Gayle was stripped of the captaincy. "The captain didn't make runs that he was expected to make but I don't expect to see a change of leadership at all. The decision [to appoint Sammy as captain] was based on decisions other people made. He [Sammy] didn't set out to be captain, he has been made captain and he is doing his best to lead the team."
43	507691	Pakistan v West Indies, 1st quarter-final, World Cup 2011, Mirpur	Hafeez lives up to promise	Osman Samiuddin at the Shere Bangla Stadium	March 23, 2011	Mohammad Hafeez's early breakthroughs set the tone for Pakistan's ruthless decimation of West Indies Associated Press Enlarge Related Links Report : Clinical Pakistan storm into semi-final News : Favourites tag added to pressure - Waqar Players/Officials: Mohammad Hafeez Matches: Pakistan v West Indies at Dhaka Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Pakistan | West Indies #p#There is so much that is substantial about Mohammad Hafeez it's difficult to believe he has had such an insubstantial career so far. He's been jipped around in his career a fair bit, of course, but then which Pakistan player - in the current side alone - hasn't? #p#Just for the record, he is an opener but he has played all kinds of roles, batted in all kinds of positions, in all formats, over an eight-year career. Sometimes he has been an allrounder, other times he has not been given a bowl at all. Since his latest return, last summer against England, he has gone back to how he arrived in international cricket: an opener who is a more than handy offspinner. #p#The thing is, he is a smart man, a smart cricketer who thinks clearly and rationally about his game and the game itself. He's always looked a good batsman, capable of threading fields as well as clearing them. Never more does he look that class of batsman than when he drives or pulls. #p#He runs well too and domestically he has shown he knows how to construct an innings. He has technical kinks, as most batsmen not named Sachin Tendulkar do, falling over too much to straighter balls, or chasing outside off every now and again. The problem is an obvious and old one: he just keeps getting out. But if there was an award in cricket - and there really should be - for just the most authoritative and prettiest 20s and 30s, he'd be a winner. #p#He's had a disappointing World Cup with the bat, again finding a blip just when he seemed to have made a career breakthrough over the last six months. Instead, he's made up by becoming an integral component of the most varied bowling attack of the tournament. It has come to be that usually his bowling has been a better platform to showcase his game-awareness than his batting; and there's a logic to that. You can have, after all, ten overs as a bowler to show it, whereas one ball can undo everything and make you look a fool as a batsman. #p#His opening spell on Wednesday, in every sense, shaped Pakistan's entire performance, a startlingly ruthless one. Saeed Ajmal may be the better spinner and he may have been the sharpshooter they drafted in for the kill, but it's telling that Pakistan opened with Hafeez. #p#Rashid Latif, his first international captain, used to bowl him with the fielding restrictions in place when he first arrived on the scene, so he's always been comfortable in the role. The challenge of it, the problem-solving nature of a Powerplay spell, seems to appeal to him: how not to get hit by Chris Gayle, how to sneak a wicket, how to bowl the right angles, how to set just the right field? #p#He doesn't usually even get the turn he got in Mirpur, and the ones that got him the wickets went straight on. But it wasn't really the spin that did West Indies in as much as it was the control. From behind the batsman at the striker's end, when Hafeez was bowling, the ball could not be seen once it was over halfway down the pitch in flight: he was dropping it so straight and on such a length that, for a while, all you could see from the back was the batsman squaring up at the very last instant, uncertain about how far to go forward, content with a victory if he just prodded the ball away. #p#In that first spell of eight overs, he gave nothing to cut, even less to drive and barely a ball to clip away to midwicket or square leg. The game was made there and then. In his last 20 one-day overs now, including the game against Australia, he's given away 42 runs for three top-order wickets. #p#And then, as so often used to be the way with allrounders in the past, success in one discipline begat success in the other. It was a nothing target and the West Indians were down; a pretty 30 would've done. Instead, an equally pretty and pumped 61 made sure the job was done good and proper. A substantial hand in fact, and a contribution worthy of a worthy player.
43	507703	Pakistan v West Indies, World Cup 2011, 1st quarter-final, Mirpur	West Indies succumb to spin	Firdose Moonda at Shere Bangla stadium	March 23, 2011	The West Indies batsmen were clueless against the slow bowlers Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Report : Clinical Pakistan storm into semi-final News : Gibson blasts senior batsmen Players/Officials: Ottis Gibson Matches: Pakistan v West Indies at Dhaka Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Pakistan | West Indies #p#It's sometimes easy to forget that West Indies have specific cricketing problems. Look at them through a wide lens and it seems that everything is in disarray - the batsmen can't form partnerships, the bowlers can't break them, the batsmen can't build on foundations and the bowlers allow the opposition to do exactly that. #p#From a distance, the whole picture is chaotic and it's easier to leave it that way, but zoom in a little and there are a few details that are worth examining. In this case, it was the way the West Indian batsman allowed the Pakistan spinners to run circles around them, until they were eventually spun out of contention in the match. #p#Eight of their ten wickets went the way of the tweakers, not because there was excessive turn on offer, but because the batsmen didn't know how to play them. Head coach Ottis Gibson admitted as much. "The wicket didn't get anybody out; it was not a bad wicket at all," he said. "It's a combination of poor batsmenship and perhaps very low confidence." #p#Only with better results will confidence levels improve but poor shot selection and approach is something that can be worked on and something that West Indies should have known they'd have to concentrate on from the first match, when their fragility against Johan Botha became apparent. The offspinner's turn away from the left-handers had Chris Gayle and Darren Bravo confused and they both fell to Botha in that match. Devon Smith and Bravo did the same against James Tredwell in the match against England and Graeme Swann caused endless problems to the other batsmen, left and right-handed sprinkled all through the order. #p#Today, they went in with four of the top six being left-handers: Gayle, Smith, Bravo and Chanderpaul. Again, two of them, Smith and Bravo, fell to the offspinner. Smith faced just five balls from Mohammed Hafeez and looked more clueless with each one. He went back to two of them, went forward to two and then didn't know what to against the fifth - ended up being caught in the crease and struck dead in front of middle. #p#Bravo, whose problems against offspin need some urgent addressing, was even more even more at sea against Hafeez, first trying to cut a delivery that was too full and defending haplessly against the straighter one. It wasn't the turn that beat either of them, but the fact that it didn't turn as much they expected. #p#Gibson said that they coaching staff had addressed the issue of the arm ball in team meetings and had spoken about how to deal with it, but the batsmen were unable to execute. "With the DRS system, the spinners are bowling a lot straighter and bowling at the stumps a lot more. We spoke about using the bat more but we ended up playing for turn and a lot of the balls went straight on and that's why we got a few lbws." #p#When it wasn't the offspin giving the left-handers problems, it was the legspin doing the same to the right-handers, but not just any legspin, it was the efforts of the tournament's highest wicket-taker, Shahid Afridi. #p#Ramnaresh Sarwan has struggled to find his form in the tournament and it showed again tonight. Afridi looked like he would Sarwan's number from ball one. Sarwan was either getting tangled up in Afridi's googly or jumping out of the crease to play through the off side, with minimal success. In the end, it was extra bounce that cost Sarwan his wicket. #p#Kieron Pollard, who staying power in anything longer than a twenty-over game is going to be questioned again, is already not the best player against spin. He likes the ball coming onto his bat with about the same speed as he likes to hit it off his bat. He only faced spinners, Afridi and Saeed Ajmal in this match and even though he saw a good few short balls, he was unable to adjust to the length. Pollard wanted to cut more than anything else and it was that shot that cost him as he eventually succeeded in only getting an edge. #p#The end result was the batsmen ended up looking like zombies, unsure of what to do and hesitant about how to do it. It was their performance that cost West Indies throughout the tournament - against England and India, when they should have won chasing and now, against Pakistan, when 112 was a pitiful account of what they may be capable of. #p#It proved a good reflection of their performance as a whole in the tournament, which Gibson said resulted in them "stumbling" into the quarterfinals after "good performances against Ireland, Bangla and Netherlands." They showed that they are good enough not to be grouped with the smaller teams, but not that they are good enough to be counted among the top teams. "We are yet to beat one of the big boys. We thought today would be that day and we are very disappointed."
43	507712	Pakistan v West Indies, 1st quarter-final, World Cup 2011, Mirpur	Favourites tag added to pressure - Waqar	Osman Samiuddin at the Shere Bangla Stadium	March 23, 2011	#p#A ruthless Pakistan can be a frightening (and rare) prospect, for the opposition as much as themselves. Tournament winning Pakistan sides have not, historically, been as smooth in their early progress as this one. But history is only made so that it can either be repeated or eventually erased, and when Pakistan catch a roll, few things in the world are better to watch or harder to stop. #p#As lost as West Indies looked in Mirpur, Pakistan's intent from the very start was, well, frightening; a fruition of the days of sweat and nights of tired limbs they have talked about in the build-up to this tournament. They are focussed as they have rarely been before. As much exasperation as there will be at the continuing frailties of West Indian cricket, there should be recognition of Pakistan's excellence. "One should give credit to the Pakistan cricket team," Waqar Younis, the Pakistan coach, said after tha game. "I think we played very positive cricket, when we had the ball in our hands and when we batted superbly." #p#In picking Saeed Ajmal for Wednesday's quarter-final, Pakistan also showed an obvious but all-too-often absent tactical nous, and in continuing not to pick Shoaib Akhtar, an emotional rigidity. A semi-final spot is already a victory of sorts, and the kind of run that has seen them to it, the bonus. #p#If there could be favourites in a contest involving two mercurial sides, it was probably Pakistan and that brought with it a kind of pressure; with such adoring support, it may as well have been a home game as well. The New Zealand result aside, people have talked up Pakistan since early in the tournament and it is a tag that hasn't always settled easily with them. So to be so jitter-free in such a game took some doing, especially for a side that has struggled to kill games over the last year. #p#Waqar Younis was particularly pleased that Pakistan's openers finally came good Getty Images Enlarge #p#"It was a pressure game for us," Waqar conceded. "Everyone thought we are a far better side and when you are favourites or people think or talk about you being a good side, it creates pressure. But that pressure in a way gave us a boost when we walked in, and picking up Chris Gayle early gave us belief that we can do it straight away." #p#Their bowling - and even fielding - has in any case been mightily impressive. But the intent in the batting, to not only chase down an admittedly meagre target, but to do it with such conviction and with such a lack of damage - this was only their third ten-wicket win ever, remember - would have pleased them more. The opening pair, in this tournament, or ever for that matter, has not been their strong suit, which is why Waqar made special mention of Mohammad Hafeez and Kamran Akmal's unbeaten 113-run stand. #p#"Bowling has not been the issue in this tournament for us. Not just here, but when you go back to the New Zealand tour, or against South Africa or England, we've done really well with the bowling. We've struggled with the openers and it is very pleasing to see them get runs like this. #p#"I hope it helps us in the future games. Hafeez played an outstanding knock with the bat. Full credit to him; when he stuck in with the ball and when he went to bat, he looked like a man in form. The happiest thing for me and the team is that we finished it with command and I think that makes a big difference." #p#Perhaps it was only appropriate the performance came on March 23rd, or Pakistan Day, something that had crossed Waqar's mind the day before. It is a national holiday and celebrations back home were predictably prolonged. "The hopes in the country were pretty high today. I found out that there was no load shedding [mandatory power blackouts] today and that makes me happier. The entire country watched this game, they prayed for us and it's kind of a gift for them."
44	507616	India v Australia, World Cup 2011, Ahmedabad	Evergreen Tendulkar inspires Ponting	Brydon Coverdale in Ahmedabad	March 23, 2011	Australia captain Ricky Ponting has drawn inspiration from Sachin Tendulkar as he looks to shrug off a slump in his form Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Analysis : Mini-battles to light up Motera Players/Officials: Ricky Ponting | Sachin Tendulkar Matches: India v Australia at Ahmedabad Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Australia | India #p#It was in Dunedin, of all places, that Ricky Ponting and Sachin Tendulkar first met in an international match. In the far south of New Zealand, two future legends lined up in an ODI; Ponting a 20-year-old who was in his third outing for his country, Tendulkar at 21 already a veteran of India's team, with 11 international centuries to his name. Great things were predicted for both men. #p#Sixteen years and 76 meetings later, Tendulkar and Ponting are the two leading run scorers in international cricket history, and they'll walk out on to the Motera ground in Ahmedabad, each hoping to end the other's World Cup career. There's every chance they will play again, when India tour Australia for a Test series later this year, but there's also the possibility this will be their final showdown. And their situations could hardly be more different. #p#Tendulkar turns 38 next month and is in the form of his career. He is the reigning ICC Cricketer of the Year, last year rewrote the record-books by making 200 in a one-day international, and is the No.1-ranked batsman in the ICC's Test rankings and No. 10 in the ODI section. Ponting, 36, is no longer in the top 20 of either list. He is fighting for his cricketing future, but has taken inspiration from the way Tendulkar has rejuvenated his career after a lean patch in 2005 and 2006. #p#"Sachin has had an amazing couple of years," Ponting said in the lead-up to Thursday's quarter-final. "His last 15 months now have been unbelievable. It's absolutely inspirational for everyone, it doesn't matter if you're my age or 25. If you go through a form slump, if you stick to the things that have worked for you through your career, then eventually things will turn around. That's what I've got to keep believing and keep working on." #p#Not since Valentine's Day 2010 has Ponting made an international century; in the same period, Tendulkar has scored eight, including two in this World Cup alone. But Ponting knows that a single innings, perhaps even the feeling that comes from nailing a single shot, can turn a man's form on its head, and as he prepared for the knockout game he was keen to watch some highlights of his brilliant 140 in the World Cup final of 2003. #p#"I think I might watch the video of that over a few times today, remind myself of all the good things," Ponting said on Wednesday. "That's what a lot of our players do, a lot of our players look at themselves and watch other times that they've played well, especially if you're struggling with the bat or the ball. It's good to look back and make sure things are in order. It certainly doesn't hurt to do that every now and then. For me, knowing that I've been able to perform well like that in big games in the past is something to reflect back on." #p#Australia's problem is that even if Ponting fires, they must still nullify the Tendulkar threat. Centuries against England and South Africa so far in this tournament have shown that Tendulkar is a big-game player as well, not that anyone needed reminding. Ponting joked that the way Tendulkar was going at the moment, he could even have another World Cup left in him. #p#"We'll both probably be in wheelchairs by then," he said. "He'll be about 42 and I'll be 40, so it'll be interesting to see us running between the wickets in that next World Cup."
44	507620	India v Australia, World Cup 2011, Ahmedabad	India delay decision on playing Sehwag	ESPNcricinfo staff	March 23, 2011	Will he or won't he? There is still some doubt over Virender Sehwag's fitness ahead of Thursday's game Getty Images Enlarge Related Links News : Dhoni expects high-skill battle Analysis : Mini-battles to light up Motera Analysis : Time for India's batting to 'bring it' Players/Officials: Virender Sehwag Matches: India v Australia at Ahmedabad Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Australia | India #p#India captain MS Dhoni has said that a decision on Virender Sehwag's participation in Thursday's quarter-final game against Australia will be taken later this evening or on Thursday morning. Sehwag had missed India's final league game against West Indies because of a knee problem but batted in the nets on Tuesday. #p#"We are taking a call [on Sehwag] in the evening or maybe tomorrow morning before the start of the game," Dhoni said in Ahmedabad today. "Apart from that, all the others are fit." #p#Sehwag participated in the warm-up round of football during Wednesday's practice session, though he did not move much. Obviously he did not want to take chances with the knee. Later, he batted in the nets, albeit only against spinners for about 15 minutes. Once again he did not exert himself, refraining from bending his knee too much or stepping out as much as he would have liked. On Tuesday too he had batted for a regulated time in the nets, and if that is to be taken as an indicator, Sehwag is likely to return for the quarter-final. #p#Sehwag's knee has been bothering him since the start of the World Cup, but his current worry is the result of swelling caused by an allergic reaction to a pain-killing injection he took after the league game against South Africa in Nagpur. Gautam Gambhir opened the innings with Sachin Tendulkar against West Indies. #p#Sehwag's one-day average against Australia is 22.65 and it has been ten innings since he has made a limited-overs fifty against them. Australian fast bowler Mitchell Johnson, who has dismissed Sehwag the most number of times across all format, said on Tuesday that he would look to bowl at Sehwag's rib-cage. However, Dhoni did not seem too concerned with the strategy. #p#"It's really good to have Sehwag opening the innings for you, because deliveries will be short and to the body. He's the kind of batsmen, if you go slightly wrong, he can make the most of that kind of a bowling. #p#"He can play an aggressive game, change the course of a game in the first five overs and give your team the kind of momentum that is needed."
44	507649	India v Australia, World Cup 2011, Ahmedabad	Ponting banks on Australia's history	Brydon Coverdale in Ahmedabad	March 23, 2011	#p#Australia meeting India in a World Cup quarter-final feels like Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal clashing in the round of 16 at Wimbledon. It could have been the dream match-up for the April 2 decider, the reigning champions three times over fighting off the ambitious and talented challengers; the billion-strong host nation against a side that never takes a backward step. #p#Now it is not to be, and in any case that is disrespectful to strong outfits like South Africa and Pakistan, who finished on top of their groups, not to mention the co-hosts Sri Lanka. But bookmakers are astute judges, and with eight sides left, Ricky Ponting's men and MS Dhoni's side remained among the four favourites. #p#By Thursday night one team will be dust. At first glance, it looks like the Australians could be getting ready for a weekend flight back to their families, and watching the semi-finals from the comfort of their living-rooms. India have two of the tournament's five leading run scorers, Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag; Australia haven't any in the top ten. And when the teams met in a warm-up match in Bangalore just over a month ago, it was India who came out on top. #p#The home-ground advantage for India should be enormous; even though they have lost their past four ODIs in Ahmedabad, the noise of a partisan crowd in such an important game cannot be underestimated. Every time India score a run, the Australians will be deafened, unable to hear themselves think, let alone the advice of the fielding coach Mike Young; each wicket that Australia take will be greeted with a disconcerting silence. #p#And yet, for all the factors favouring India, there is something about Australia - they know how to win cut-throat matches. Last time Australia failed to lift the World Cup, Steven Smith was six years old, although as they proved against Pakistan last week, they haven't entirely forgotten how to lose at the world's biggest tournament. #p#Despite struggling for form himself, Ricky Ponting sounded very confident ahead of Australia's knockout match with India Getty Images Enlarge #p#Importantly, the Australians know what it takes to beat India at home, as they did with an undermanned squad in late 2009, when they claimed the ODI series 4-2. Four of their players, including Michael Clarke, Nathan Bracken and Brad Haddin, were unavailable due to injury before that series began, and another five, Brett Lee among them, flew home mid-tour as the casualty list grew. #p#"Wherever we've played India and whenever we've played them, we've had a really good record against them," Ricky Ponting said. "The last tour here in one-day cricket [in 2009] was one of the proudest I've had as a player and as a captain. We had five or six of our better players out and they were at full strength, and we managed to beat them in their conditions. We can take some confidence from that. #p#"We know that our last game wasn't our best game in the tournament so far, but by the same token, a loss when that happened was not going to be the worst thing for us I don't think. They've seemingly got through reasonably well, but some of the collapses they've had with their batting in the last couple of games have been quite dramatic. Hopefully... we can really expose that middle to late order in this game and see where that takes us." #p#Three times in this tournament India's middle order and tail have folded quicker than a poker player holding a 7-2 off-suit. If Australia can deal the right cards to the top order, they know they could take the pot. They're also aware that Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Yuvraj Singh and MS Dhoni all have considerably lower batting averages against Australia than their career marks. #p#Not that Australia should be overly bullish. They have struggled against quality spin over the past month, and with Harbhajan Singh, R Ashwin, Yusuf Pathan and in-form part-timer in Yuvraj all ready to work their magic, the Australians are searching for new ways to handle the slow stuff. That is especially so if Ashwin takes the new ball. #p#"If there's an element in the tournament where we haven't been at our absolute best, it's probably been earlier on in the innings, not being as positive as we need to be," Ponting said. "That doesn't mean all-out aggression and taking massive risks and hitting fours and sixes, it just means finding ways to rotate strike better and putting a bit more pressure back on the bowlers. We might have a few surprises up our sleeve for the Indians as well, if they want to bowl spin early on, there might be a few different things that might happen." #p#Quite what those will be remain to be seen. But one thing is certain: by Thursday night, there will be five other quarter-finalists glad to see either the co-hosts or the reigning champions out of the tournament.
44	507663	India v Australia, World Cup 2011, Ahmedabad	In-form batting gives India advantage	Madhusudhan Ramakrishnan	March 23, 2011	Brett Lee: the highest wicket taker for Australia against India in ODIs Getty Images Enlarge Related Links News : Dhoni expects high-skill battle Players/Officials: Brett Lee Matches: India v Australia at Ahmedabad Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Australia | India Grounds: Sardar Patel Stadium #p#Australia unmatched in World Cups Being pre-tournament favourites, Australia and India were not expected to meet earlier than the semi-finals. However, Australia's surprise loss to Pakistan in their final game has meant that they play India for the first time in World Cups in the quarter-final stage. #p#While India have been the better team in the tournament so far, Australia's biggest plus is their extraordinary record in knockout games in big tournaments. They have won nine and lost just three of the knockout games played since 1999. Their last loss to India in a major tournament came in the ICC Champions Trophy in Nairobi in 2000. Although their 34-match undefeated streak came to an end with the loss to Pakistan, they still have their run of three successive World Cup wins and two Champions Trophy titles to defend. Australia have a 7-2 record in head-to-head clashes with India in World Cups, including four wins in the last four meetings. India will also be well aware that they have not won a single game in a major tournament against Australia when batting second. #p#Australia were totally dominant in ODIs in India between 2000 and 2007 but they have been more vulnerable of late, and India have a more even record against them in the last three years. Australia will, however, draw confidence from the fact that they won an ODI series against India in 2009 with a highly depleted side. #p#Australia v India in ODIs Played Australia India W/L ratio (Australia) Overall 104 61 35 1.74 Since 2005 24 12 8 1.50 In India (2000-2007) 17 11 5 2.20 In India after 2007 7 4 3 1.33 In global tournaments 13 8 4 2.00 #p#Closer contest in recent years Australia won 11 of the 16 ODIs played against India in India between 2000 and 2007. The retirement of Adam Gilchrist, Matthew Hayden and Damien Martyn has significantly affected Australia's batting strength. In ODIs between the two sides before 2007, Australia averaged over 42 and scored at 5.73 runs per over while India averaged less than 30 and scored at a lower rate. In ODIs after 2007, India have done a lot better, averaging over 35 and scoring at 5.58 runs per over, a rate slightly higher than Australia's. Despite the loss of top players, Australia have been the best batting side in ODIs in India since 2008. #p#Australia v India in ODIs in India since 2000 Team Period Matches W/L ratio Runs per wicket(batting) Run rate Australia 2000-2007 15 2.20 42.48 5.73 India 2000-2007 15 0.45 29.88 5.22 Australia 2008 onwards 9 1.33 41.75 5.40 India 2008 onwards 9 0.75 35.31 5.58 #p#Indian batting far more threatening India's top three have been in top form in the World Cup, averaging more than 50 with a strike rate over 102. Australia's top three batsmen have been less successful with an average of 43.06 and strike rate around 80. Ricky Ponting, one of only four batsmen to score over 2000 runs against India in ODIs, has had an especially poor run of form. In ODIs since 2009, India's top order has been far more impressive than Australia's with a better average and strike rate. Australia will be concerned about the inability of the top-order batsmen to convert their half-centuries into hundreds. They have had six fifties in the World Cup so far but not a single century. #p#The middle order performance of both teams is more evenly balanced. Australian middle-order batsmen average slightly higher but score at a lower rate than India's middle order. India have again been better at converting fifties into centuries. In the 2011 World Cup however, Australia's middle order has done much better: they average nearly 40 with a strike rate of 93 while India have corresponding figures of 34.60 and 85.90. #p#The batting stats of the two teams in the first 15 overs in the tournament so far reflect the performance of the top order. While India have been much better in terms of run rate, they have gone on to lose wickets more often than Australia, who have lost only two wickets in the same phase of the innings in all their matches. India have been the better team by a distance between overs 15 and 40. They average nearly 89 and score at 5.45 runs per over while Australia average just over 33 and score at 5.27. The end overs have been a huge problem for India. They have suffered collapses against England, South Africa and West Indies. The biggest reason for these collapses has been their inability to perform in the batting Powerplay. Teams have managed to pick up regular wickets against India during the batting Powerplay and restrict them. #p#Batting stats of teams in matches since 2009 Team Batting position Average Strike rate 100s 50s Australia Top order (1-3) 38.06 80.85 13 55 India Top order (1-3) 42.40 92.81 18 38 Australia Middle order (4-8) 36.31 85.96 4 58 India Middle order (4-8) 35.36 86.58 13 35 #p#Contrasting bowling attacks Australia's decision to go into the tournament with a pace-heavy attack has been inspired by the fact that it has been a successful strategy for them in the last few years. While they have leaked a few runs in the first few overs of most matches, they have picked up wickets at regular intervals. The pace trio of Brett Lee, Mitchell Johnson and Shaun Tait will be a huge threat for an Indian line-up which is far more adept at handling spin. The bowling stats clearly show that Australia's pace attack has been far more potent than India's in recent ODIs. India have relied on their spinners to provide the breakthroughs in most matches leading up to the tournament but in this World Cup, Zaheer Khan has been the most impressive of their bowlers. In the previous game against West Indies, India opened with R Ashwin and are likely to do the same against an Australian top order who generally find it easier to score off fast bowling. #p#Bowling stats for teams in ODIs since 2009 Team Bowler type Matches Wickets Average ER 4WI 5WI Australia pace 77 453 27.71 4.87 12 8 India pace 69 247 34.79 5.71 7 0 Australia spin 77 106 36.27 4.86 3 0 India spin 69 205 36.24 4.95 3 2 #p#Potent pace duo Lee and Johnson have been two of the most successful bowlers against India in ODIs in the last few years. Lee, who has been superb in the tournament so far, has dismissed Tendulkar nine times in ODIs, the most by any bowler. Since 2000, he has picked up Tendulkar's wicket seven times while conceding just 4.17 runs per over. Despite Virender Sehwag scoring at nearly eight runs per over off Johnson, he has been dismissed four times while scoring a total of just 62 runs. The fast-bowling pair has been highly successful against Gautam Gambhir, Yuvraj Singh and MS Dhoni too. Sehwag, who has scored nearly 75% of his runs in boundaries, and Dhoni have been the only two Indian batsmen to score at more than five runs per over off the two bowlers. #p#Brett Lee and Mitchell Johnson against Indian batsmen Batsman Dismissals Average Scoring rate Boundary % Sachin Tendulkar 10 34.90 4.48 60.17 Virender Sehwag 7 20.00 5.71 74.28 Gautam Gambhir 7 15.00 3.98 38.09 Yuvraj Singh 6 17.16 3.86 44.66 MS Dhoni 7 21.85 5.15 49.67 #p#Australia and New Zealand notched up comfortable wins over Zimbabwe in the two matches played in Ahmedabad in the World Cup so far. The track has generally been an excellent one for batting but has assisted spinners later on. Four scores over 270 have been chased successfully at this venue. In the last match played at the venue before the World Cup, South Africa piled up a massive 365 and beat India by 90 runs. Teams batting first in day-night games since 2000 in Ahmedabad have won four and lost five matches. India do not have a great record in Ahmedabad having lost their last four games played at the venue.
44	507670	Australia v India, World Cup 2011, quarter-final, Ahmedabad	Battle of the flawed heavyweights	The Preview by George Binoy	March 23, 2011	#p#Match Facts March 24, Ahmedabad Start time 1430 hours (0900 GMT) #p#Whether Virender Sehwag will play Australia in Ahmedabad is not yet public knowledge Associated Press Enlarge Related Links News : Dhoni expects high-skill battle News : Evergreen Tendulkar inspires Ponting Features : Haddin aims for solid foundations News : India delay decision on playing Sehwag News : Ponting banks on Australia's history Analysis : Time for India's batting to 'bring it' Matches: India v Australia at Ahmedabad Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Australia | India #p#The Big Picture #p#This match can be seen through several prisms: champions of the world v pre-tournament favourites, misfiring middle order v misfiring middle order, pace-reliant attack v spin-heavy attack, athletic fielders v incompetent fielders. Australia against India is a clash between teams with obvious imperfections. The loser goes home while the winner heads to Mohali, to play Pakistan on March 30. #p#If any of Ricky Ponting's men are relatively weak-willed, compared to the Australians of campaigns past, they have had plenty to help them focus in the days leading up to this quarter-final. An Australian paper reported Cricket Australia were going to discuss Ponting's future as captain. An English paper reported Ponting was going to jump before he was pushed. An Indian paper reported sinister allegations about Australia's game against Zimbabwe, prompting an angry retraction demand from the ICC. Whether they were planted to drive Australia to distraction is debatable, but none of the stories was substantiated. #p#Off-field dramas aside, Australia's progress in this World Cup was smooth at first - a comfortable win against Zimbabwe, a smashing one against New Zealand - and then uninspiring, when they laboured against Kenya and Canada. In each of those matches, at least one weakness was evident: a captain struggling for form, a middle order troubled by turn, spinners incapable of striking, and fast bowlers with wonky radars. All of these frailties were exposed by Pakistan, who ended the legendary unbeaten World Cup run on 34 matches. Australia's successes have been built around the opening partnership of Brad Haddin and Shane Watson, and the energy of Brett Lee. That might not be enough to topple India - but it might, for MS Dhoni's team is far from the shoo-in semi-finalist it was expected to be. #p#Before the World Cup began India's batting line-up was thought to possess the armour of God, their bowling was considered less formidable but effective in home conditions, and the fielding was known to be average. As their campaign played out, it became evident that the armour didn't fit the middle order - there were collapses of 9 for 29 and 7 for 51 - and the bowling, while adequate on helpful surfaces, was mediocre on flat pitches. The fielding has not been average. It has been abysmal. Slow anticipation, slower approaches to the ball, failure to cut off angles, and plain lethargy have allowed opponents to run at will. #p#For a long time during West Indies' chase, it seemed as though India would make the quarter-finals by beating only the three weakest teams of their group, which would have vindicated this forgiving format designed to prevent the upsets of 2007. But Zaheer Khan saved the day, as India expect him to. Zaheer apart, India have relied on Yuvraj Singh for an extraordinary number of wickets, as well as consistent runs in the middle order. The key, though, is at the top, where Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag have provided tremendous starts. But even if they do it again against Brett Lee and Shaun Tait, it may not be enough. #p#Form guide (completed matches, most recent first) #p#India : WLWWT Australia LWWWW #p#Watch out for... #p#The batting Powerplay was conceived as an asset for the batting team, an aid in the pursuit of fast runs. In the months leading into the World Cup, it began to be a banana skin, with wickets falling as batsmen resorted to rashness during the fielding restrictions. India have slipped spectacularly on it during the tournament, scoring 9 for 154 off 130 balls. During the batting Powerplay, India lost 1 for 32 against England, 4 for 30 against South Africa and 4 for 28 against West Indies, squandering positions of immense strength. Australia haven't mastered it either, making only 4 for 121 off 100 balls. Those five tricky overs could make or break a campaign tomorrow. #p#If the stakes weren't large enough to fire up Ponting , the talk about his captaincy and retirement will have strengthened his determination to end his form slump with a cathartic performance. Ponting has been dismissed by the short ball - a strength turned weakness - in this World Cup and by spin, a more traditional subcontinent susceptibility. His composure has also been strained. Eight years ago to the day, Ponting ended India's World Cup dream in Johannesburg with a century of frightening brutality. He plans to watch videos of it in the hope that it will help him reproduce something similar in Ahmedabad. #p#Sachin Tendulkar watched that World Cup slip out of India's grasp as the bowlers conceded 359 in the final. He was then dismissed in the first over of the chase. The Player-of-the-Tournament prize was little consolation. He has the opportunity to write a wonderful script tomorrow - a 100th international century in a victory that will dethrone the World Champions. But cricket, like life, is never perfect. #p#Team news #p#Virender Sehwag missed the last group game because of an inflamed knee and India are keeping news of his fitness under wraps. He batted on Tuesday and on the eve of the game as well, but Dhoni said they might wait as late as match morning to take a decision on his participation. If Sehwag does not play, India are likely to field the same XI that beat West Indies. #p#India (probable): 1 Virender Sehwag/Gautam Gambhir, 2 Sachin Tendulkar, 3 Gautam Gambhir/Suresh Raina, 4 Virat Kohli, 5 Yuvraj Singh, 6 MS Dhoni (capt & wk), 7 Yusuf Pathan, 8 Harbhajan Singh, 9 Zaheer Khan, 10 R Ashwin, 11 Munaf Patel. #p#Australia have had an unchanged team since Michael Hussey replaced his brother in the XI, and they are likely to do the same against India. The weakest links have been middle-order batsman Cameron White and offspinner Jason Krejza and potential replacements could be David Hussey and allrounder John Hastings. #p#"We haven't finalised our 11 yet. We'll have a bit more of a think about things this afternoon, make sure all our players have got through training well, with no injuries or illnesses," Ponting said. "There's a good chance that any of our guys could come in for this game. Coming off a loss last game wasn't ideal for us, and we have to have a look at what we think is going to be the best make-up and balance for the game tomorrow." #p#Australia (probable): 1 Brad Haddin (wk), 2 Shane Watson, 3 Ricky Ponting (capt), 4 Michael Clarke, 5 Cameron White/David Hussey, 6 Michael Hussey, 7 Steve Smith, 8 Jason Krejza/John Hastings, 9 Brett Lee, 10 Mitchell Johnson, 11 Shaun Tait. #p#Try picking the XIs for tomorrow's game by playing Team Selector. #p#Pitch and conditions #p#Australia played their World Cup opener at Motera, where they started slowly against Zimbabwe before accelerating to a formidable total. Ponting expected tomorrow's pitch to be similar to that one. "It was pretty much what you'd expect for a subcontinent wicket: a little bit slower, spun a bit more in the second innings of the game maybe than the first," he said. "We're going to send our coaches down late tonight to have a look at the ground and see if there's any dew about. I think it's supposed to be 41 [degrees] or something [similar], so it will be nice and hot for the boys out there." #p#Stats and trivia #p#India have lost their last four games in Ahmedabad. They batted first in three of those matches. #p#Brett Lee has 50 ODI wickets against India, the highest by an Australian bowler. Four of his nine five-wicket hauls are against India. #p#India have not won a game against Australia in a global tournament while chasing. Their last win against Australia in a World Cup was in 1987. #p#In 14 ODIs against India in India since 2007, Australia have won eight and lost five. #p#Quotes #p#"People have been talking about the short-pitched ball a lot, and not to forget the best batsmen in the world don't like facing the short-pitched deliveries. One good thing, it's not something new to us. It follows us. Wherever we are, the shadows of short-pitched deliveries can be seen. I don't think it's a new strategy." MS Dhoni hopes that familiarity will breed confidence when Lee, Tait and Johnson thunder in. #p#"Maybe we've just learned to keep our mouths closed a bit more. A lot of that chat hasn't really happened since [Glenn] McGrath and [Shane] Warne went out of the team. Hopefully, our cricket will do the talking on the field tomorrow." Ricky Ponting on sledging and whether there will be plenty of it during the quarter-final.

And why not - the Aussie has claimed Tendulkar's wicket nine times in ODIs, a record that he shares with Shaun Pollock and Chaminda Vaas. All modes of dismissal have been witnessed: bowled, caught, lbw, hit wicket. Lee has always smiled at the sight of Tendulkar, and considering this will probably be the last time both men face each other, he will bound in unafraid. The weapons of destruction, as in the past, will remain the same: bowling at maximum pace, Lee gets the ball to swing away, the length always full, and the short-pitched delivery as the surprise element to tempt Tendulkar to go for the uppercut or the pull. If Lee has never compromised on his strengths, Tendulkar has raised his batting to the level that he has desired. On the cusp of scoring his hundredth international century, Tendulkar will rely on the trusted weapons: a good eye, a wide array of shots, and a surfeit of patience and nerve. Considering that Ricky Ponting has bowled Lee in short bursts in this World Cup, and the fact that the endurance levels of both combatants match those of marathon runners, this mini contest is bound to build up to a crescendo in Ahmedabad. #p#Zaheer Khan v Shane Watson Zaheer will angle the ball away. He will pitch the ball on a length and move it in. He will bowl an innocuous straighter delivery and cut the ball both ways - all this only to test if Watson is reading his mind. The Australian better be attentive, otherwise Zaheer is certain to overwhelm him with his cunning. These days Zaheer bowls with a sense of calm that makes a batsman uneasy. The look in his eye suggests that he knows exactly where he is going to pitch the ball, what the response will be and how he is going to trap his opponent. And like all good strike bowlers, he wants to snare the victim early. Watson likes width. There is great strength in his muscular frame and if a bowler hits a 'bowling machine length' he is murderous on the drive. But at times he does not get around his front pad quickly enough to avoid being trapped in front of the wicket. Zaheer will test him with different lengths. Australia need Watson to bat through most of the innings and lay a solid platform, and his biggest challenge will be to deny Zaheer the mental edge. #p#Virender Sehwag v Mitchell Johnson Johnson believes in the McGrath formula of naming his target before hitting it. This is the second time in less than a year the Australian has riled Sehwag. Last year during the Test series he had Sehwag's measure - twice. Overall in one-dayers, the Australian has dismissed Sehwag four times giving away just 62 runs. Sehwag is coming back from an injury, having missed the previous match due to an inflammation of the knee, but he won't buckle and is bound to take Johnson on his word if he can get past the new-ball pair of Lee and Shaun Tait. #p#Ricky Ponting v Ricky Ponting This is a battle with the self. The struggle is within Ponting. Probably it is also the ego - the Indian fast bowlers will pitch it short as soon as the Australian captain walks in. Trust Ponting to go for the pull or the hook. So far this World Cup, Ponting has not made any noise except when talking to the match officials. He says he is trying to spend time at the crease. But he is trying too hard. If he can start enjoying batting at the moment, he might find his way back. #p#Michael Clarke v the Indian spinners First the numbers: Clarke has been dismissed only three times by Indian spinners (Harbhajan Singh, Anil Kumble and Virender Sehwag). He averages 117 and scores at 5.37 runs per over against Indian spinners. Doesn't that mean Clarke dominates the spinners? Yes and no. Clarke is no doubt a good player of spin, but increasingly he has been in two minds facing the Indian slow bowlers. Take Australia's tour of India last year. Then Clarke never spent enough time at the crease to find his feet. Instead he jumped out of the crease too quickly, too early and indecisively. Clarke is usually one of the few good batsmen who uses his feet smartly, but against India last year, he was doing so while simply trying to defend, thereby taking a risk that greatly outweighed the potential reward. Immediately the spinner knew he had him. What he needs to do now to is alternate playing both back and forward and use all of the crease. More than quick feet, it is quick thinking that will keep him safe.
44	507690	India v Australia, World Cup 2011, Ahmedabad	Haddin aims for solid foundations	Brydon Coverdale in Ahmedabad	March 23, 2011	Brad Haddin has formed a strong alliance with Shane Watson at the top of the order for Australia Associated Press Enlarge Related Links Analysis : Mini-battles to light up Motera Players/Officials: Brad Haddin | Shane Watson Matches: India v Australia at Ahmedabad Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Australia | India #p#Before Australia's first World Cup match, Ricky Ponting spoke of how important it was for Brad Haddin to turn his encouraging starts into match-winning hundreds. A 30 or a 50 from a top-order player, Ponting said, rarely wins a game for his team. #p#And Haddin, unlike his opening partner Shane Watson, hasn't made an ODI century since last March. But nor has he failed very often. Since the start of the Australian summer, Haddin has opened in 15 one-day internationals, and only twice has he scored less than 20. #p#Marcus North's Test manhattan showed little but skyscrapers and tiny sheds; Haddin's one-day graph is full of mid-range apartment buildings. The captain might want more tall towers, but Haddin is Australia's leading run scorer in the World Cup, and is confident that he is doing his job. #p#"I'm a bit different [in my thinking]," Haddin told ESPNcricinfo this week. "I think the main thing is to get the team off to a good start. Statistically, Shane and I are nearly averaging 50 with our partnerships. The important thing for me is to make sure you're setting a good platform so everyone can build on that throughout the whole game. From a personal point of view, everyone wants to score more hundreds and get the personal result, but the main thing is to be consistently setting the team up for a good platform to launch from at the end." #p#And in that regard, the Haddin-Watson combination is working reasonably well. Their average opening partnership is 49.50, and of all the pairs that have opened for Australia on at least 20 occasions, only the brief Adam Gilchrist-Simon Katich liaison averaged more. #p#Even so, Haddin could stand to score his runs a shade quicker. Against Pakistan, he took 80 deliveries to make his 42, and the spin-heavy Zimbabwe attack kept him to 29 off 66. A more fluent Haddin was seen in the win over New Zealand, when he raced to 55, and once he eventually found his rhythm against Kenya, he finished with 84 at better than a run a ball. #p#"A couple of times here, I've started a bit slower because I haven't really seen the bowlers before," Haddin said. "When we played against a team like New Zealand, you know a bit more about the bowlers, and the way they're going to play. You just judge the situation on whatever gets thrown your way, and what the wicket is going to do, whether it's going to be a 300 wicket or a 260 wicket, things like that." #p#A feature of Haddin's game during this World Cup has been the way he backs away to give himself room to hit over the off side against the fast bowlers. When it works, it looks brilliant, but when he misses, it looks ugly and manufactured. #p#"I haven't been doing that quite as much in the last couple of games," he said. "It's something that you just work on with different conditions. The important thing in these tournaments is to play with freedom. We've been here a long time now and we are able to play with freedom. If we play that way and at our best, there's no one that can beat us." #p#That may be true if Haddin and Watson bat like they did against Canada, when they mauled the attack and put on 183 at better than a run a ball. Handling a team like India on Thursday, or Pakistan if they reach the semi-finals, is a much sterner challenge, although at his best Watson can destroy any attack. #p#Haddin has had a front-row seat for some of Watson's finest innings, including the unbeaten 161 he managed against England at the MCG in January. Despite his own talents and experience, Haddin is effectively the junior partner, and he knows that sometimes his role is simply to give Watson the strike. #p#"If you bat together for any period of extended time, you start to understand each other's game," Haddin said. "I think Watto and I complement each other. There are days when Shane is on, and you've just got to make sure you feed him the ball. If he takes a bit longer, then it's your day to maybe take a few more risks because you know how destructive he can be, the longer he bats." #p#The Haddin-Watson combination has been Australia's preferred opening partnership over the past two years. For a year before that, Watson and Shaun Marsh were forming a strong alliance as Australia tried to work out who would open at the 2011 World Cup. #p#In 2007, the decision was much more straightforward. Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden headed an imposing Australian batting order that never lost more than six wickets in a match throughout the entire tournament, and nearly half the time posted 300-plus totals. #p#Haddin spent two months in that World Cup squad as the backup for Gilchrist. Like Mitchell Johnson, he didn't get a game, but learnt a lot about success. #p#"That was a wonderful experience, to be part of a whole World Cup campaign," he said. "We did have a tremendous run and an outstanding team. From a player's point of view who wasn't playing, you can't get a better education than watching the way the team prepared, watching the momentum they created through the tournament. It makes you hungry to be a part of it." #p#Four years later, Haddin is a key part of it. And if Australia are to make it four World Cup triumphs in a row, they'll need a few more of his good starts.
44	507711	India v Australia, 2nd quarter-final, World Cup 2011, Ahmedabad	Time for India's batting to 'bring it'	Sharda Ugra in Ahmedabad	March 23, 2011	MS Dhoni admitted India had struggled in the slog overs and the batting Powerplay through the tournament AFP Enlarge Related Links Preview : Battle of the flawed heavyweights News : Dhoni expects high-skill battle News : India delay decision on playing Sehwag Analysis : Mini-battles to light up Motera Analysis : Immense Zaheer continues his Australian opera Players/Officials: MS Dhoni | Ricky Ponting Matches: India v Australia at Ahmedabad Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Australia | India #p#On the sandy outskirts of Ahmedabad this Thursday, all will be revealed. If things go according to the home team's plan, a month of uncertainty about the kind of cricket they have played in this World Cup will suddenly cease. #p#Victory will return to India the status of being popular, irresistible favourites of their home World Cup. It will mark the decisive announcement of the end of Australian ownership of cricket's biggest prize. It will mean that for the first time in 19 years, there will be a World Cup final without the Australians. #p#The quarter-final between the world's two top-ranked one-day teams may be a World Cup contest arrived at two rounds too early. Its result will, however, emphatically establish which of the two teams' plans have worked: Australia's unrelenting dependence on pace in the subcontinent or India's slow-drip progress from group to knockout stages. #p#After the defeat to South Africa in Nagpur, the news that floated - much like one of Harbhajan Singh's more deceptive offerings - out of the Indian camp, sought to pour water over the heated debate around the team's stuttering World Cup. Citing fairly reliable "team sources", journalists were told that the Indians had decided to handle the Cup in two phases: in the group stages, players would be kept relaxed, fresh and pressure-free, intensity upped in the tournament's shoot-out section. This meant easy-does-it training sessions in the last month as well as the final tinkering around with team composition. The reasons behind it were irrefutable: the end of a long season, a slew of injuries to a cast of seasoned, if ageing, performers and the hot-house environment at home. Easy does it would be the only way to do it in the first month. #p#What the Indians then put out against West Indies in Chennai certainly appears to be their general bowling plan for the knockout: R Ashwin to open the bowling, a few early overs for Zaheer Khan with the new ball and the heavy dependence on spin all the way through till the seamers could come on towards the end in reverse gear. #p#At his media session, Ricky Ponting spelt it out carefully in case no one had noticed. "We have an idea that they will probably open with Zaheer with the new ball and one of their spinners, get their spinners on early and their part-timers on early. Then bring their quicker bowlers on around the ball-change time and then probably close the innings out with their quicks." He then graciously explained to his audience what could be anticipated at Motera on Thursday. "We are going to face at least 30 overs of spin and they can probably be assured that they will be facing at least 30 overs of fast bowling." #p#So there. The bowling tactics have been laid out for all to salivate over, like one might over one of the region's famous set meals, the Gujarati thaali. On Thursday, the other half of India's game plan will have to come to fruition. The batsmen must, to borrow from American slang, "bring it."; be that their A-game, their best form, or their long-distance runner's kick that will take them past the finish line. #p#To be honest, so far India's batsmen have not quite brought it as a unit. Going by numbers alone, all of the batsmen appear to be in that intangible called form. There are two Indian batsmen in the top five run-scorers of this World Cup. So far, no team has produced as many centuries [five] as India has. No other team has dazzled with as many fours and sixes as India either. Yet, after their earliest performance in Mirpur, the Indian batting line-up has not been collectively fluent. There have been stomach-churning late-order collapses in three of their six matches and the top four have been out within a 100 in seemingly easy chases against the two Associates in the group. India captain MS Dhoni admitted India had not tackled the slog overs or the batting Power play as well as they should have. #p#One of the key features of the Dhoni-Gary Kirsten regime has been the sense of "personal responsibility" given and taken by individuals, which has led to exceptional results, particularly in Test cricket. Translating that into combined batting consistency in the World Cup group stages has been India's primary glitch; this despite winning the toss (and so being able to dictate the early course of play) against England, Ireland, South Africa and West Indies. #p#India will expect more from its batting unit, and Dhoni didn't think it would be much of a burden on the hot bats. In any case he said, it was the bowlers who faced the rougher side of the stick. "If you are batting first you look to put 300-310 on the board and it's the bowlers who are supposed to defend it," Dhoni said. "If you are chasing 310 runs, normally you don't see a couple of batsmen chasing the score. Normally, you have one of the batsmen with the No. 8, 9 or 10 at the other end. Ultimately the pressure is on them [the bowlers] whether they are bowling or batting." To be fair, it is the already under-strain Indian bowling attack, full and part-timers put together, that has kept the team's results effective in the competition. #p#Against Australia, it is only fair that India's batsmen take on a Dhoniism: call it the "the responsibility of pressure" or "the pressure of responsibility" Or call it executing the plan methodically put into place for the most critical phase of India's World Cup, which will either be proved dead right or dead wrong. #p#It was Ponting who explained how this plan business really worked even when a team was having a far from smooth passage through a World Cup, like Australia had in the past or India were having now. "It's the self-belief, that's the biggest thing," Ponting said. "You have to keep believing that what you are doing is right. The longer you stick at it... things tend to change for you." #p#If there is anything the Indian batting possesses, it is a conviction about its skills, particularly in conditions like Ahmedabad. It is what could primarily take them through tomorrow, rather than the meaningless mind games that seem to be taken more seriously by those outside the team camps than folks in them. The Indian batting's susceptibility against short balls, of which there can be a few expected from Australia is, Dhoni said, an old and somewhat battered hat. "The best batsmen in the world don't like facing the short-pitched deliveries. This is not something new to us. It follows us. Wherever we are, the shadows of short-pitched deliveries can be seen. I don't think it's a new strategy." #p#A famous 19th century Prussian general called Carl von Clausewitz had made a wise observation about military campaigns when he said: "No plan survives first contact with the enemy." It could be applied, minus the shooting, to cricket as well, particularly to the one-day game. Ponting, now a troubled, but insightful short-game sage, said that ODIs between two teams like Thursday's quarter-finalists, were often ruled by a single, emphatic event. "It can just be one good shot, it could be one good ball, it could be a freakish piece of fielding that goes your way and all of a sudden, you've got some momentum back." #p#India needs precisely this single emphatic event to spark some momentum in the batting to put its knockout plan into something approaching execution; of the kind that it seeks; not of the variety cricketers avoid mentioning on a World Cup quarter-final morning.

On a dry pitch, aiding turn, India couldn't remove a wonderfully solid Ponting, but found a way around him to hold Australia to a competitive 260. Tendulkar set the base and the middle order threatened to choke, but Yuvraj played a blinder to charge India to a famous win. #p#Sometimes, they say, one four can change things around. That cliché came alive today, in the final ball of the 39th over, with India needing 72 from 67 deliveries, when Yuvraj spanked Shaun Tait for a stunning four over backward point. It oozed of skill, impishness and dare under fire. Until then, in the preceding few overs, India choked and spluttered badly to almost hand the game to Australia. That Yuvraj hit over point sensationally turned the game on its head. #p#The next over proved to be the game-breaker as Brett Lee was looted for 14 runs: Suresh Raina played the most assured pull of his life to crash the first delivery to the boundary and Yuvraj carved the final delivery over point, but it was a shot in between that really reflected the enthralling contest. It was a screaming yorker from Lee, from around the stumps, and Yuvraj crouched, opened the bat-face and stabbed it through to the third man boundary. Lee looked stunned, and you felt that was the moment when India affected the jail break. #p#Until Yuvraj took ownership of the chase, the pressure-cooker situation had got to India and they were beginning to choke. In five mad overs between the 32nd and 37th, just after Virat Kohli had swiped a full toss from David Hussey straight to midwicket in the 29th over, it was absolute pandemonium as India looked hell bent on self-destruction. Gautam Gambhir tried to run himself out three times and was successful on the final attempt. In the 33rd over, he ran for a non-existent run after Yuvraj had played the ball towards midwicket but Ponting missed the sticks. In the next over, he got into a yes-and-no situation with Yuvraj and would have been run out had Brad Haddin, who dashed to the short mid-on region, thrown it at the non-striker's end. Gambhir was run out next ball, again running mindlessly after Yuvraj stabbed David Hussey wide of the first slip. #p#India required 93 runs from 101 balls at that stage, but they slipped further into the abyss as MS Dhoni got out after looking edgy. He nearly got involved in a run out, had a big swing and a miss against Lee and perished next delivery, cutting to point to leave India needing 74 from 75 balls. It was then that Yuvraj decided to play the World Cup innings of his life. #p#The batting Powerplay was the final hurdle, but Raina, who gave admirable support to Yuvraj after Dhoni's exit, walloped the first ball from Lee over long-on and Australia's fight evaporated with that shot. #p#Before Yuvraj, India's chase revolved almost entirely around Sachin Tendulkar. It was a slow pitch, but Tendulkar played some shots that defied the nature of the track. Tait v Tendulkar in particular lived up to the billing. Tendulkar punched the first delivery he faced, and the first from Tait, through cover point and, upper cut the next legal delivery to the third man boundary. Tait sledged, Tendulkar stared, and the chase was soaked with intensity from then on. Tait was soon out off the attack but returned to silence the crowd. He gave away six runs in his first over on return, which included two wides and also saw Tendulkar getting to his fifty. He struck with the first delivery of his next over, the 19th of the innings, with a delivery released from a slightly round-armish action that held its line outside off stump. Tendulkar tried to steer it to point but edged it to Brad Haddin. #p#Spare a thought for the Australian captain, probably playing his last World Cup match and to Australia, who were last eliminated before the finals of a World Cup way back in 1992. Whenever Zaheer Khan threatened to push India in front, Ponting shoved Australia ahead. The knock was a microcosm of Ponting the man. It had skill, grit, bloody-mindedness, and dare; it was Ponting. It will probably be the only knock from him that won't be remembered for many scintillating shots and it will be cherished for how responsibly he curbed his natural strokeplay. #p#There was tremendous poise in how he dealt with the slow nature of the pitch and a great amount of skill in the way he handled spin. Ponting showed sheer grit in the way he held the Australian innings together, and admirable character to do it when he wasn't in great form, on such a big stage. When he was fresh, he had to face Harbhajan Singh, his nemesis, bowling from around the stumps. #p#Ponting countered him by shuffling to his right and working the ball with the turn. When he was tired, he had to face the reverse-swing from Zaheer. In the middle, he picked Ashwin's carom ball, and mixed caution and aggression against Yuvraj Singh. #p#Australia's slide and India's resurgence in the middle overs began with an awful shot from Michael Clarke, who top-edged a slog-sweep against Yuvraj to long-on in the 31st over. Zaheer dismissed Michael Hussey with that knuckled slower one to leave Australia wobbling at 140 for 4 in the 34th over. Ponting and David Hussey took the batting Powerplay in the 44th over and added 44 vital runs without losing a wicket. Ponting must have thought he had done all he could to ensure Australia remained in the competition but he was outdone by Yuvraj. #p#Match Timeline
44	507817	India v Australia, World Cup 2011, Ahmedabad	Wasted reviews, and the perfect legbreak	Brydon Coverdale and Nagraj Gollapudi at Motera	March 24, 2011	Sachin Tendulkar bowling is a rare sight in cricket these days AFP Enlarge Related Links Matches: India v Australia at Ahmedabad Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Australia | India #p#The shot of the day At his best, Ricky Ponting makes batting look as easy as breathing. Unfortunately for Australia, his best has not often been seen in the past year. But when Ponting advanced down the pitch and lifted Yuvraj Singh over cover for six, it appeared as simple as playing a forward defence. Ponting played some fine shots in his innings, but that stroke, which took him to 72, was the "wow" moment. #p#The non-appeal R Ashwin was so certain that he had Cameron White caught behind in the 38th over that he didn't even bother appealing, clapping as he walked down the wicket to congratulate MS Dhoni on the catch. There was just one problem. White wasn't going anywhere, and the umpire Marais Erasmus hadn't raised his finger. A review was inevitable, but the replays showed Erasmus was spot on - the ball had lobbed up off White's forearm as he tried to sweep, and had not touched his gloves as the bowler thought. #p#Munaf redux When Brad Haddin flung hands, shoulders, bat and bloody murder straight towards Munaf Patel in his second over, the man called Munna would have seen his life - or at least the World Cup - flash in front of his eyes. When Kevin Pietersen had lashed one at him in Bangalore, Munaf had flung up his hands to stop the ball, landed on his derriere, and seen the ball pop up tamely for the easiest of return catches. In Ahmedabad, Haddin's retort had been so fierce, that the ball burst through his palms and screamed all the way to the boundary. #p#The Warne moment Sachin Tendulkar brought the full house to its feet by coming on to bowl the 30 over. Having bowled a full toss on his second ball, Tendulkar might have given the Aussies a false sense of comfort. His next delivery was a perfect slow leg break, straight out of Shane Warne's book. The flight was perfect, luring Ponting to come out, but then it dipped and then it turned square, leaving Ponting, the Indians and the 45,000 fans gasping. #p#The DRS moment India got their DRS reviews muddled not once but twice. Egged on by Munaf, Dhoni asked for a review when Brad Haddin was hit on the left thigh. Even the naked eye could tell that the ball, even if it had pitched on middle, was travelling over the stumps. Replays confirmed that and the Indians returned to business abashed. The second review was used unsuccessfully for the Ashwin-White appeal. Once strident opponents of the DRS, the Indians were in a rush to use it today, and eventually Ricky Ponting escaped a certain lbw shout when on 91. #p#Catch controversy of the day Ricky Ponting. India. A catch that fell short. It had all the combustible ingredients required for an A-grade blow-up. When Gautam Gambhir clipped a Shane Watson delivery to square leg and Ponting dived forward in an attempt to get his fingers under the ball. It wasn't immediately clear whether a clean catch had been taken. But lest there be any flashbacks to Sydney, Ponting didn't appear to claim the catch this time, and let the umpires decide what to do. They went upstairs for help and the TV official saw a replay that clearly showed the ball bouncing short of Ponting's hands. The crowd was unhappy with the Australia captain, but he seemed to have done nothing wrong, uncertain if he had grasped the ball cleanly or not. #p#Harikari of the day Two overs, four balls, three run-out chances. India needed 94 with six still standing, Ricky Ponting, who could hit a bulls eye wearing a pirate's patch a year ago, squandered the first juicy chance. Yuvraj Singh tapped Mitchell Johnson to the leg side, straight towards Ponting at midwicket. Yuvraj was disinclined to sprint, but his partner Gautam Gambhir was already out off the blocks. He was turned away by Yuvraj, was left stranded out of the crease, but Ponting who failed to pick up the ball cleanly, and when he did, his throw missed by inches. #p#Two balls later there was more. Yuvraj played all over a fastish David Hussey delivery, and the ball rolled towards the unmanned leg side. Gambhir screamed for a single. Yuvraj, disinterested initially, started and stopped. Gambhir twisted and turned. But Brad Haddin, who had rushed to collect the ball threw to the wrong end. Gambhir, who was left stranded for the second time, walked back to safety. Amazingly the duo had another absolutely identical brain fade off the very next delivery. Gambhir was left stranded and fuming, and this time the Aussies made sure they were not going to let the Indian pair escape. Gambhir walked off shaking his head in disgust and mouthing abuse that would have horrified a few million parents watching with offspring for company.
44	507884	Australia v India, World Cup 2011, 2nd quarter-final, Ahmedabad	India bank on small but brisk partnerships	Madhusudhan Ramakrishnan	March 24, 2011	India consistently maintained a higher scoring rate than Australia did ESPNcricinfo Ltd Enlarge Related Links Report : Yuvraj sets up Pakistan showdown Matches: India v Australia at Ahmedabad Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Australia | India #p#India had never beaten Australia in a major tournament while chasing. Their last win over Australia in a World Cup was also way back in 1987. In this game, though, India's strategy to rotate their bowlers throughout the innings did not allow any Australian batsman other than Ricky Ponting to settle down. Faced with a stiff target of 261, India pinned their hopes on their strong batting and the key to the victory was the way they constructed partnerships at the top of the order. While Australia had two decent stands in the beginning of their innings, they lost few wickets in the middle, which limited their score to 260. India, despite not having any huge partnerships, had stands of 44, 50 and 49 for the first three wickets and scored at a healthy run-rate throughout. #p#With the dismissal of MS Dhoni, Australia had a sniff when India required 74 runs off 75 balls. What happened next was stunning. Yuvraj Singh hit three fours off a Brett Lee over and with Shaun Tait gifting five wides in his next over, India were back in the contest. Yuvraj and Suresh Raina scored 27 runs off the 40th and 41st overs, bringing down the equation to a much more manageable 41 off nine overs. The partnership featured seven fours and a six, but more importantly 22 singles and five twos. Yuvraj Singh made his fifth fifty-plus score in the World Cup. His tally in a single tournament is second only to Sachin Tendulkar's seven in 2003. #p#From the batting worm for both teams, it is clear that India started their innings at a higher run-rate than Australia and maintained the difference till the end. The crucial sixth-wicket stand between Yuvraj and Raina pushed the scoring-rate up at a point when it looked like Australia would control the game. India's decision to open the bowling with R Ashwin was a brilliant move as it did not allow Shane Watson and Brad Haddin to get away to a flying start. Regular bowling changes throughout the innings produced wickets and slowed the rate of scoring. In contrast, the Australian attack was erratic and gave away 16 wides. #p#Partnership stats for both teams (runs, run rate) Team 1st wicket 2nd wicket 3rd wicket 4th wicket 5th wicket 6th wicket 7th wicket Australia 40, 4.00 70, 5.45 30, 3.82 10, 3.52 40, 5.10 55, 7.10 15*, 10.00 India 44, 5.38 50, 5.00 49, 4.74 25, 5.17 19, 4.56 74*, 10.27 - #p#Australia's decision to go with a pace-heavy bowling attack proved a little costly in the end. However, the performance of their slow bowlers on a track assisting spin was far from convincing. Australia's spinners averaged 61.00 in the tournament, the highest among the eight quarter-finalists. Despite conceding less than five runs per over, the Australian spinners picked up only one wicket. The Indian spinners in contrast picked up four wickets in the Australian innings. #p#Some of the other stats from the game are highlighted below #p#Ricky Ponting scored his fifth century in World Cups and his sixth against India in ODIs. It was his first score over fifty in the tournament. Ponting's century was only his fifth in an ODI defeat and his second in a World Cup defeat after his 102 against West Indies in 1996. Sachin Tendulkar went past the milestone of 18,000 runs in ODIs. He also made his 20th fifty-plus score in World Cups which is comfortably higher than the second-placed Ponting, who has 11. Yuvraj Singh became only the fourth player to score over 300 runs and pick up ten wickets in a single World Cup. Kapil Dev was the first player to do it when he achieved the feat in the 1983 World Cup. The win is India's first in a major tournament against Australia in a chase. Their earlier six chases had ended in defeats. It is also the first time that Australia have failed to reach the semi-finals since the 1992 World Cup. India won their first game in Ahmedabad after four consecutive losses.

He wanted to revisit his brilliant 140 in the triumph over India, and draw whatever inspiration he could from the memory. He won't want to see many replays of this loss, but he should keep the video all the same. #p#He can use his fighting 104 as a template for how to bat in the next phase of his career, given that he and the selectors want him to play on. It is not easy for a batsman of such immense talent to resist his natural urges, and there were hints of Ponting's flair during his first international century for 13 months. But mostly, it was a pared-back innings that relied on the fundamentals. #p#In his later years, the country singer Johnny Cash released a series of albums with a stripped-back production, all unnecessary instruments and distractions removed. What listeners heard was simply a man and his voice, and the world was reminded of his raw talent. It is no crime for a veteran to go back to basics. In fact, it can be a refreshing change. #p#In the early stages of Ponting's innings, there was little that was flashy. Singles were knocked around, gaps found and his eyes adjusted to the conditions and the bowling. When he did take a risk, it was calculated, and came against the part-timer Yuvraj Singh, who was clipped over midwicket for a boundary and then swept forward of square leg for four more. #p#It helped that Ponting hardly had to negotiate a bouncer. Zaheer Khan was the only member of India's attack with genuine pace, and he preferred to bowl full than dig it in short. That meant Ponting didn't have to make the decision on whether to play the hook, the shot that was once a great strength but over the past couple of years has become an Achilles heel. #p#Against Canada last week, Henry Osinde hurried Ponting in to lobbing a catch from an attempted hook, and with due respect to Osinde, he is no Shaun Tait. During Sachin Tendulkar's lean times, when the cover-drive was proving a weakness, he shelved the stroke and found his runs in other ways. Perhaps Ponting can look at a hook-less innings like this and follow suit. #p#At Motera, the failures of Michael Clarke, Michael Hussey and Cameron White, and the inability of Brad Haddin to capitalise on another strong start, forced Ponting to be Australia's anchor in the biggest one-day match they have played in years. Far from dragging the ship down, he kept it steady. He turned the strike over with 47 singles, and chose the right balls to go after. #p#In his prime, it would have been a point of honour for Ponting to go after the best opposition bowlers, show them who's boss. Here, he displayed the utmost respect for Harbhajan Singh, who has dismissed him more times in international cricket than anyone else, and attacked weaker links like Munaf Patel. #p#And as impressively as Yuvraj has bowled in this tournament, Ponting knew he too was a man who could occasionally be dispatched. His drive over cover for six off Yuvraj was all class. When he eventually did try something new and perilous, an uncharacteristic reverse sweep, he perished. #p#That came soon after Ponting reached his century, his first international hundred in any format since February 2010. There was no outpouring of emotion. He raised his bat, but didn't remove his helmet. Truth be told, he barely cracked a smile. There was a job still to be done. He believes there still is. #p#At 36, Ponting is in his cricketing twilight, although he has no desire to take his final bow any time soon. The one thing that might have forced the hand of the selection panel was a continued lack of runs. Australia are at the end of a World Cup cycle and he should move on from one-day cricket. But in whatever formats he plays from now until retirement day, this innings should serve as his template.
44	507892	India v Australia, 2nd quarter-final, World Cup 2011, Ahmedabad	We were 20 runs short - Ponting	Brydon Coverdale at Motera	March 24, 2011	#p#Ricky Ponting arrived in India in early February, confident that his team could win a fourth consecutive World Cup. Less than a week ago, Australia remained the only undefeated team in the tournament, and his hopes remained high. He will fly home a bitterly disappointed man, after Australia were knocked out in the quarter-finals by India in Ahmedabad. #p#"I'm devastated," Ponting said after the five-wicket defeat. "We came here with high expectations; we had a well organised group that had come off a good series of one-day cricket against England. We found it difficult at times getting a bit of momentum and continuity with the way our programme was set out, but that was no excuse. #p#"We had plenty of time to train and we got to a stage where we thought we could win a game today [Thursday]. We weren't far off, but just little critical moments are what cost us the game. We didn't have enough high-quality partnerships and not enough pressure with the ball. It only takes a couple of those little moments for things to change." #p#Ponting certainly did his part with a captain's hundred, but wickets kept falling throughout the Australian innings. There were only two half-century stands in the innings, between Ponting and Brad Haddin and later Ponting and David Hussey, and the visitors never quite got on top of the Indian attack. R Ashwin opened the bowling and immediately found some sharp spin, and the Australians knew they were in for a tough day. #p#Ricky Ponting was "devastated" his team had failed to live up to his high expectations at the World Cup AFP Enlarge #p#"I thought we were 15 or 20 runs short with the bat," Ponting said. "After we saw the first over Ashwin bowled and how much it spun, we said to ourselves than 250 or 260 looked like it would be a good total out there. As it turned out, we got that, but we probably could have got more. We couldn't get a partnership going, we'd lose a wicket at a really bad time; we probably were one or two wickets too many down to be able to accelerate when we wanted to at about the 35-over mark. #p#"They played well as a team today. You've just got to look through their batting card. [Gautam] Gambhir, [Sachin] Tendulkar, Yuvraj [Singh] all got fifties, and got them at a reasonable rate. Their bowling was steady. Zaheer [Khan] was good again today, especially right at the end of the innings in the Powerplay overs. I thought we played their spin pretty well today. It was a good combined effort by the Indian team and I think they're going to be pretty hard to beat as this tournament wears on." #p#India head to Mohali to take on Pakistan in a semi-final, a match that Ponting believes the hosts will win, while the Australians will fly home. They will spend some time with their families before returning to the subcontinent in early April for their three-match one-day series against Bangladesh.

Apart from about ten minutes of headless running, from which they were lucky to escape with the loss of only one wicket, it was a display worthy of a knockout match; and it impressed Ricky Ponting enough to anoint them favourites to win their semi-final clash against Pakistan. #p#India were always expected to win on the back of their batting but, for the second consecutive match, the bowling delivered. Against West Indies it was difficult to ascertain the quantum to which the bowlers had been assisted by the opposition batsmen, but against a far more purposeful group of batsmen on Thursday, the Indians gave little away. And the most noticeable, and dramatic, improvement was in the field. Even MS Dhoni, who has worn a look of resignation whenever asked about Indian fielding, reckoned that his team might have saved 15 runs in the field. It might have made the difference between victory and defeat. #p#It helped that they put up their best fielding side. Suresh Raina and Virat Kohli were both electric in the ring, not only saving runs and keeping the batsmen honest but visibly lifting their team-mates. Early in the innings, Kolhi stopped a scorching drive at short cover and had a lightning shy at the non-striker's end. Raina dived first to his left and then his right at point to cut off boundaries, and suddenly India looked a perkier team, determined not to give an inch. Yuvraj Singh joined in, making desperate stops off his own bowling, and R Ashwin hared around in the outfield, turning fours into twos. #p#The fielding never reached a level where it could be described as consistently spectacular. Munaf Patel was still sluggish and Yuvraj failed to pick the ball a couple of times near the boundary, but it was miles above the embarrassment it had been throughout the tournament. Maybe it was all part of a grand design: they were saving themselves up for the real matches. #p#The bowling rose to the challenge too. Ashwin's figures might not say it, but he has been a vital addition to the attack. He provides the control that India have missed at the start of the innings, and he has also provided early breakthroughs in both matches he has played so far. #p#Shane Watson's wicket was among the most crucial today. With his reach, and the ability to generate his own pace for strokes, Watson is a dangerous batsman on the slower wickets, and he was forced to swipe at a ball because Ashwin starved him of space. #p#Ashwin's presence in the XI also seems to have spurred Harbhajan Singh, the senior offpinner, to bowl more attackingly. Harbhajan was much more full on Thursday and though he went wicketless, he was the spinner who looked most likely to make a breakthrough. And as it has been the case throughout the World Cup, Yuvraj was the one who picked up the wickets, and it was not by coincidence. #p#Yuvraj may still look the innocuous handyman bowler who must quickly and unobtrusively get his overs out of the way but it's clear that he has worked on his bowling. The trajectory is consistently higher now, and consequently, there is more spin. When a spinner gets batsmen out driving, he is doing it right. His two scalps, of Brad Haddin and Michael Clarke, derailed the Australian momentum mid-innings. #p#And then there was the magnificent Zaheer Khan. What he has lost in pace he has more than made up with his mastery over his craft. He has been Dhoni's talisman in the World Cup. He has provided both the brakes and the breakthroughs every time Dhoni has needed them. He did Mike Hussey in today with that wonderfully deceptive slower ball he has developed for left-handed batsmen. It's bowled full, at drivable length, but it's never there for the drive, because it arrives after the bat has made its arc. Inevitably, Hussey's bat met with air, the ball found the stumps. #p#And then, apart from two balls down leg, Zaheer's yorkers were virtually impossible to score off in the batting Powerplay. Even Ricky Ponting, then batting in the 90s, was forced to work him around for singles. Asked later at the press conference to compare the Indian and Pakistan bowling attacks, Ponting said, and he looked like he meant it, that they were quite similar. #p#That's as big a compliment as the Indian bowling attack could have hoped to get.
44	507894	India v Australia, 2nd quarter-final, World Cup 2011, Ahmedabad	'I am playing this tournament for a special person'	Nagraj Gollapudi at Motera	March 24, 2011	#p#"For the first time in my life there have been claps in a press conference. I am sure this is a special moment for me, guys." Yuvraj Singh made a telling opening statement. The whole media room was in splits. For the next 17 minutes Yuvraj played the role of entertainer effortlessly, his answers laced with wit and charm. #p#It was difficult to imagine the man sitting there as the same one who had fought doubts, conditions and the formidable Australian fast bowlers and stood tall and strong for one-and-a-half hours to eventually take India into the semi-finals. Still, it was not entirely a surprise; Yuvraj has now been named man of the match in four of India's seven matches so far this World Cup, so he must be getting used to it. #p#"I've been batting really well since the England game," Yuvraj said. "The plans are working for me: trying to work till the end, trying to hit the ball down the ground into the gaps. I just kept telling myself to bat till the end, stay till the end." #p#With 12.3 overs left, 74 runs required and just one specialist batsman in Suresh Raina for support, Yuvraj was left to hold the Indian innings together and take it past the finish line. The Aussies were steadily closing in, having picked up the wickets of Gautam Gambhir and MS Dhoni in quick succession. #p#Yuvraj had come up with an all-round performance in India's 80-run victory against West Indies last Sunday. His 113 in that match was his first century since June 2009. It was a knock of determination, as he fought hard to stay on his feet in the Chennai heat while suffering from dehydration; he even threw up a few times while batting. Later in the evening he returned to pick up two wickets to expedite the Indian victory. #p#Even in the earlier matches in the tournament, he had restrained his attacking instincts admirably to stay put, and brave India through tense moments in victories against Ireland and Netherlands after the main batsmen had lost their way easily. Coming into the quarter-finals, Yuvraj had run the whole gamut of experiences, which only helped him survive the high-pressure situation at Motera, which he said had drained the players both mentally and physically. #p#Yuvraj Singh kept his emotions in check till the final runs were scored, after which he let out a victory roar AFP Enlarge #p#On Thursday, he turned up match-fit and was one of India's best bowlers with two top-order wickets and followed it with an unbeaten 57, an innings he described as one he had built in his dreams exactly a year ago. "The emotions, I really can't explain them, because it was tough out there. From last year I have been dreaming of playing Australia in a crucial game. I don't know why Australia; probably because they are three times world champions. I'd been thinking about this moment for the last 365 days and it actually came true. I just believed in myself, I envisioned that moment from time to time: me staying there till the end and hitting the winning runs for India. So it is a very emotional moment for me." #p#There were a few jitters, especially the child-like indecisiveness between him and Gambhir while going for tight singles. Gambhir fell victim to one such moment of confusion and was run out. Yuvraj accepted his role in the mix-up. "It was a bit of a mishap with Gautam. We haven't batted too much together and the running between the wickets was just out of order. And I think it was my mistake and I apologise." #p#It was not an isolated incident, as there was immense pressure on both teams. Experienced hands like Brett Lee failed to come through when Yuvraj and Raina began turning the screw on the Australians, at the start of the final eleven overs of the match. Lee had taken the wicket of Dhoni in his previous over, but in the 40th, the pair took him to the cleaners, with Yuvraj hitting two scorching boundaries. #p#In the next over, Shaun Tait was wayward and gave away 13 runs. Those two overs proved to be one of the catalysts of India's win, but Yuvraj said it was not a planned counterattack. "It was very difficult to control the emotions because the heartbeat was racing in the pressure situation. If we made one mistake in a situation like today we would be out of the World Cup. Various thoughts run through your mind, but I decided that I would only watch the ball, keep it simple and as far as possible not hit in the air. Unless the asking rate peaked to seven-and-a-half, only then I would go for the big hits; till then I would hold back." #p#Yuvraj revealed that there was a driving force behind his recent success, a person he will unveil if India make the final on April 2. "I am playing this tournament for a special person. That special person always comes into my mind whenever I am in a pressure situation. Hopefully it will work out in the end." #p#Not only was he a bit secretive, he even turned philosophical about his good work against Australia. "You have a lot of thoughts [in the mind while batting] but whenever you want to desperately do it for your country and your team it somehow works out. It is great it is working at the right moment in the World Cup. It is a great victory for us." #p#Yuvraj had planned for every eventuality. On the eve of the match, he was the last batsman to face throwdowns from coach Gary Kirsten. Yuvraj knew the Australians would fire a lot of short-pitched stuff at him to unsettle him. "I just wanted to concentrate on hitting everything down the ground while leaving out the short balls." #p#That planning came to fruition on Thursday. He checked his shots and emotions till the victory stroke was unleashed. Once the job was done, he came crashing and sliding down on his knees, the way football players rush to the flag after scoring a goal. Then he let out a victory roar. A little later, he trotted out the jokes.

Within a week, India will truly understand just how far Yuvraj Singh and Suresh Raina took them in this World Cup. On Thursday night, Yuvraj and Raina left Motera like the man they have named its cricket ground after. They were their team's iron men who held up against the driving will of four-time world champions Australia and at the Sardar Patel stadium, lifted their team into the World Cup semi-final. #p#Their partnership and its significance resonated well after everyone inside Motera had left; the two exhausted and emotionally-spent teams and the 42,000-odd spectators who produced a monstrous wave of sound and support for the Indians. The pigeons who reside in the stadium roof burst into rounds of startled night flight over the cricketers below them as Yuvraj and Raina gave wings to India's World Cup aspirations. Despite four fifties and a century in the match, their sixth-wicket stand of 74 over 10.1 overs was the highest of the game. #p#Before this World Cup, Yuvraj had been dogged by injury and poor form, his image as a cricketer tattered and taunted at. At the same time, Suresh Raina seceded the young batting tyro spot to Virat Kohli, and was on the verge of finding himself regularly edged out of the Indian World Cup XI due to the power-hitting gifts of Yusuf Pathan. He, first stepped into the team only for the last group game in Chennai, an injury to Virender Sehwag settling that debate for one night. The Raina for Pathan swap in Ahmedabad had been, Dhoni said, because "Raina is technically better and we were keen on batting 50 overs." Raina rested his own case with emphasis on Thursday night. #p#When he arrived at the crease, there were 12.3 overs left in which India needed 74 more runs with five wickets remaining. It looked reasonable but a clutch of middle-order wickets - Gautam Gambhir was goofishly run-out, Virat Kohli hit a full toss right into Michael Clarke's hands and Dhoni cut Brett Lee in his second spell straight to point - had brought about a rumbling of anxiety. One more wicket and the tail was exposed. One more mistake and India could say good bye to its World Cup. These were not Associates nor main line underperformers, these were the monstrous Australians, non-stop World Cup winners for 12 years, men capable of ripping throats to extract victory. #p#At the other end, Yuvraj watched with alarm as Lee's stinging wicket maiden sent Dhoni back. It was, he said afterwards, "a bit of a shock" to lose a trusted partner. It was his ever-growing World Cup equanimity, that had him coolly set about making new calculations. "I just thought that if I could have a 30-40 run partnership with Suresh, we can take it till the end," Yuvraj said. #p#Through this World Cup, Yuvraj has remained the fulcrum of India's batting; the centre who has held it together through top-order wobbles and Powerplay collapses. He told Raina to ignore the climbing asking rate and take his time. "I told him I know we are chasing a run-rate of six, but play a few balls, see what is happening around and let us get a 20-30 run partnership." #p#Raina began his innings with three dot balls from Lee's wicket maiden and the bowlers were shown respect in four of the next 11 balls. In the first half of his 28 ball innings, Raina was made to play seven of his eight dot balls. Once the frugal few were out of the way, he did his best to rotate strike for Yuvraj and put his head above water, to pounce on anything slightly lenient by the bowling. #p#It was as if using the drib-drab philosophy of these two partners is what broke Australia and its ambitions down. The fielding still stayed committed but the backups began to get wayward, bodies were flung in the direction of the ball but the throws began to return to the centre of the wicket. Ricky Ponting called his two 6th wicket adversaries, "terrific." Their control of their innings, he said, "didn't allow us back in the game." It was a typical Raina innings, as support cast to senior colleague, but what made it exceptional was where it had materialised. In a World Cup knock out game against a high quality opposition. Men of lesser will could have melted. #p#Again, it was Raina who broke free the spell of the Brett Lee wicket maiden with a muscular pull to the boundary in his very next over. Two balls later Yuvraj stepped in with two boundaries to attack the rhythm and confidence of the opposition's leading strike bowler. It is perhaps 40th over that actually established that the match was now India's for the taking. #p#Yuvraj said Raina had a run of average games earlier but Thursday's performance, "showed Suresh's nerve in a very crucial stage.That must have given him a lot of confidence," Raina on Thursday was more than second fiddle to an older partner. He was a more than handy decoy for diverting the aggressive attention of the bowlers. In Ahmedabad, Raina was the perfect foil to Yuvraj's epee. The senior man laid out for his younger colleague the manner in which to lead a chase, by breaking it down to a simple instruction, to stay grounded. The ball on terra firma, the eyes focussed on the next clutch of runs, to obliterate panic through partnership. #p#When Yuvraj crossed his fifty, there was no bat-stabbing at those sitting outside the dressing room. He just put his head down and crossed over to his crease because his job was not actually over. When it did end, close to 11pm, the winning runs were manufactured by a flashy, lofted cover drive over the infield. He then broke free, pulled out a football-style slide on the turf and let himself roar. Raina sprinted across the length of the pitch and leapt into his arms, the PA system began playing thumping celebratory music and the ground began to reverberate. #p#This partnership will entrench iself in India's ODI folklore. It will be remembered alongside other stands like Ganguly-Dravid in Taunton, in the 1999 World Cup, or Yuvraj-Kaif in the 2002 Natwest Trophy final or Dravid-Yuvraj in the 2003 World Cup game against Pakistan in Centurion. Yuvraj's presence in three of India's most memorable one-day stands has already set him aside to be thought of, according to Sanjay Manjrekar, as "one of the all time greats in 50 overs cricket." If Raina pays close attention, he may be able to understand what it takes to get that far.
44	507939	World Cup 2011	Ponting was overburdened - Buchanan	ESPNcricinfo staff	March 25, 2011	Ricky Ponting has been overburdened by people in formal leadership roles in Australian cricket says John Buchanan AFP Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: John Buchanan | Ricky Ponting Matches: India v Australia at Ahmedabad Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Australia #p#John Buchanan, the former Australia coach, has said Ricky Ponting has been let down by people in leadership roles in Australian cricket, leaving him overburdened. Ponting's role as captain is to lead the team by example, he said, not preoccupy himself with off-field matters. #p#"We saw that last night," Buchanan told AAP , referring to Ponting's quarter-final ton against India. "He was able to direct his energies towards one game. All thinking about developing the side and building a culture, selections here and selections there, were irrelevant. That is what he is capable of doing when his attention is rightly directed. #p#"Ricky still has an incredible amount to offer Australian cricket, but he has to be in the right frame of mind to do that," Buchanan said. "For the last 18 months or so that hasn't been the case because he has, in a sense, tried to take on too much responsibility for the whole team." #p#Ponting was at the receiving end of much criticism in the lead-up to the game against India, one of the reasons being his lack of form. He led Australia to two straight World Cup wins but was also captain during his team's Ashes defeats in 2005, 2009 and early this year in Australia. Amid calls for his resignation as captain after the World Cup and, in some quarters, retirement, Ponting struck form with a determined century in the quarter-final, but it proved inadequate as Australia were knocked out of the competition. Buchanan said Ponting's time at the helm was made difficult by some people around him. #p#"I'm disappointed with people around him, who have allowed him to do that [be overburdened]. That has contributed to making life very difficult for him in the [leadership] role." Buchanan refrained from naming the people he believed to be behind Ponting's problems, but said it is 'people in other formal leadership roles in and around the team'. #p#"I think there is a range of other people who relied on him to do more of the other work - building a team, building a culture, looking at selection - which are things that he has felt very personally involved with. But those things have been much bigger than he anticipated I think and he should not have been allowed to burden himself with it."
44	508027		A hero even in defeat	Sambit Bal	March 25, 2011	A masterful performance in another World Cup game against India, but one to end in disappointment Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Features : Australia's loss heralds the end of an era Features : Ponting creates a template Players/Officials: Ricky Ponting Matches: India v Australia at Ahmedabad Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Australia #p#At the end of his final press conference as a World Cup captain, Ricky Ponting was asked if he was the tragic hero of the match. It drew a little a shrug and a wan smile. "I honestly don't know how to answer that," Ponting said, "I'm a tragic hero? I don't feel much of a hero at the moment, I must admit." #p#It was one of the many touching moments during the press conference. Ponting cut an elegiac figure in the press conference, as he had done most through the match. He answered the questions, even the inane ones, with sincerity, dignity, and the occasional bit of humour. How did he rate India's chances? "Better than ours." Did he consider playing John Hastings ahead of Jason Krejza? "Five fast bowlers? I can imagine what you guys would have said then." But there was no hiding what he felt: he looked gutted. #p#I had been at his press conference in Colombo after Australia had lost their last league match against Pakistan. It was his first loss as a World Cup captain, and it ended a winning streak for Australia that spanned 12 years and 34 matches. But Ponting had looked upbeat. His form would turn around; the trophy could still be won. #p#On Thursday, though, his eyes looked glassy, his visage drawn. After enduring a wretched World Cup as a batsman, Ponting had produced his best innings of the tournament, and arguably, the best innings of the match. And though this "wasn't the first time I have scored a hundred and we've lost", there would be no more World Cup innings for him. Australia and Ricky Ponting, World Cup colossuses both, would be going home the next day. "I feel devastated," he said a few times. #p#Sachin Tendulkar, the author of many solos during India's days of misery, would know the feeling. Even in this World Cup Tendulkar has scored two hundreds but India didn't win on either occasion. On Thursday, his was one of the three Indian half-centuries and his team got over the line. He would take that over his 100th hundred, which must wait for another day. #p#Australia have produced an abundance of champion cricketers since Ponting's arrival but very few of them have had their character tested as severely. #p#It was Ponting's first international hundred in 13 months, and he couldn't have chosen a better match. On a pitch that turned in the first hour, Ponting came in to bat with two offspinners - one of them his old nemesis Harbhajan Singh - in operation, and he built his innings gradually and expertly, playing late, watching the ball and working it into the gaps. Unlike his last World Cup hundred against India, it wasn't a commanding performance, but masterful nonetheless. It wasn't his fault that the Australian innings stuttered and withered away. #p#"It might take me a while to think about my own innings tonight," he said, "Just how I feel at the moment and the fact that we're going home on the plane. I don't think I'll actually think much about it at all. #p#"It could be my last World Cup game. If I end up having made a hundred in my last World Cup game, then I guess I can be pretty happy at the end of the day. I've always been one of those guys that's never really reflected on what I've done until a lot later. I've never really been a stats man, that doesn't worry me." #p#Ponting and Brett Lee were the only two members in the current side who were part of that team in 2003 that had mauled India in final. And both gave all of themselves to keep Australia in the hunt. Lee bowled a sharp and tight opening spell and came back to provide the breakthrough with the wicket of MS Dhoni. He then returned for a final tilt with a bandage over his right eye after a despairing dive ended up with the ball smashing into his head. But there were no last-gasp twists in store for Australia: Suresh Raina lofted his first ball in to the stands, and effectively ended Australia's World Cup reign. #p#But they didn't go without a fight, and the man who was at the heart of their World Cup dominance made the strongest stand. Australia have produced an abundance of champion cricketers since his arrival but very few of them have had their character tested as severely. Even in defeat, Ricky Ponting has gone out a hero.
44	794395	47	Yuvraj steers India clear			shares #p#Play 03:26 #p#"For the first time in my life there have been claps in a press conference," Yuvraj Singh said. #p#He had just dealt the final blow that dumped Australia, the defending champions, out and fast-tracked India's chances of World Cup glory. #p#In the first innings, Yuvraj's left-arm sliders strangled the batsmen at one end, even as Ricky Ponting soldiered on at the other. Still, 261 in a knockout match was a handy target, as the Indian middle order found out. It had buckled under aggression from the Australian bowlers, leaving 74 to get in the last 12 overs. #p#There was no undue urgency from Yuvraj, but the intent was obvious throughout his unbeaten 65-ball 57. Singles began trickling, the pressure began to ease, and the dressing room began hoping again. As long as he was in, Australia looked beatable. #p#Yuvraj transformed a Brett Lee yorker into a boundary ball, deposited a bewildered Shaun Tait on the midwicket boundary, and hit the winning runs, taking a fourth Man of the Match award in the tournament. He had come into the World Cup on the back of poor form, but against West Indies he broke a run of two years without a century before coming back to pick up a couple of wickets as well to help India into the quarter-final. #p#Once there, he would not be denied. "This is the moment I have lived for as a cricketer," Yuvraj said. Later it would be revealed how much when doctors diagnosed he had played the tournament while battling cancer.

45	507773	New Zealand v South Africa, quarter-final, World Cup 2011, Mirpur	South Africa bank on successful strategy	Firdose Moonda in Mirpur	March 24, 2011	#p#South Africa will approach their quarter-final match against New Zealand in much the same way as each of their group games - by playing to plans and laying a platform rather than attempting anything overly flashy. Some call it calculation, others cautiousness, but for South Africa it's a tactic that's worked on pitches that have made this World Cup a far more even contest between bat and ball. #p#The Mirpur pitch has yielded one high-scoring game, in the tournament opener, and another, isolated meaty total from South Africa last week but all the other five scores have been low. It's a surface that has been slow and required patience, and South Africa have reason to approach it with care. "It's not a free-flowing wicket here, you need to set your base and work hard," Graeme Smith said at his pre-match press conference in Mirpur. #p#In their six group stage matches, South Africa have had practice in building an innings from the ground, with cautious starts that allow for explosive endings. They went at less than five runs an over in the first four games: on a tricky Delhi surface against West Indies, on the most seamer-friendly pitch they've come across in India in Mohali against Netherlands, on a crumbling Chennai pitch against England and even on a batsmen's paradise against India in Nagpur. They crept over the five-an-over mark at Eden Gardens against Ireland and in Mirpur against Bangladesh, but not by much. #p#Four out of those six times, the team has gone on to score more than 250, indicating that the acceleration in the run rate comes later on. It's a move away from the style of one-day cricket that was seen a few years ago, when teams would look to reach 75 runs or more inside the first 15 overs. It may be the result of the additional Powerplay that can be taken later on, but even that's proved to be a double-edged sword for batsmen, who can lose their wicket in a moment of rashness. On pitches where there is something for the bowlers, it's created a delightful tension that can run through an innings and one that can only be broken if there is a solid base laid first on which the fireworks can shoot off from. #p#West Indies' capitulation to spin against Pakistan could prompt South Africa to retain a spin-strong attack Getty Images Enlarge #p#Smith expects the pitch on which the quarter-final will be played to be similar to the surfaces they have found throughout the sub-continent, perhaps with a little more life. "It looks very green, probably because we are not used to seeing grass here so it might be more even paced than the wickets we have played on previously," Smith said. That doesn't mean it's going to be a strip the seamers can make merry on. "I expect it to turn a bit, because it's still very dry." #p#It will present a challenge for the batsmen and the bowlers, who will have to exploit conditions to their advantage. After watching Pakistan's demolition job of West Indies last night, South Africa may be prompted to go in with all three frontline spinners. The convenor of selectors, Andrew Hudson, only arrived this morning, and Smith could not reveal whether that is their line of thinking just yet. Going down that route will probably mean going in with only six, specialist batsmen which suggests that Morne van Wyk will have to be benched and AB de Villiers would have to keep, a decision that can only be taken later on. #p#If de Villiers can't keep and if the choice becomes two out of the three spinners, matters get more puzzling. Legspinner Imran Tahir is certain to play a role, because of his wicket-taking ability that complements the strikeforce of seamers. "Imran has been an asset. He is the most attacking of the spinners," Smith said. There should also be place for left-arm spinner Robin Peterson, who took a career-best 4 for 12 against Bangladesh and is the team's highest wicket-taker. "It's been a process for Robbie. He has been around the team for a long time and in the last six to eight months people have been showing confidence in him and that has helped his self-belief," Smith said. #p#While Johan Botha didn't get any special words from Smith at today's press conference, his ability to control the game in the middle overs has already earned him high praise. Botha does exactly what Smith was referring to in a batting sense, about working hard and building a base, in the bowling sense. Because of his primary ability as a container, Botha works on drying up runs and in the process is usually on the receiving end of wickets, particularly in the crucial middle phase of an innings. #p#Smith recognised that having someone who can perform that role is what has made the South African attack more dynamic. "We've been able to pick up wickets outside of the fist 10-15 overs in the middle period. It's a mindset thing, the spinners believe they can take wickets and as the captain, I have to believe in them." #p#It could boil down to another selection dilemma for South Africa, one they will be only too happy to have. In keeping with the watchful nature of their approach, they will pick the starting XI on who best will contest with the opposition on the day. Smith said that New Zealand have "a top four with power hitters who take the game to you," which could imply the need for a container in the Botha mould. Smith also said the New Zealand bowlers have done a good job of "taking the pace off the ball," which means that the middle order, which is most likely to face those bowlers, will be expected to give another solid account of itself.
45	507790	New Zealand v South Africa, World Cup 2011, quarter-final, Mirpur	Transformed South Africa aim for semis	The Preview by Liam Brickhill	March 24, 2011	#p#Match Facts March 25, Dhaka Start time 1430 hours (0830 GMT) #p#Imran Tahir has been a revelation for South Africa in this tournament AFP Enlarge Related Links News : South Africa bank on successful strategy Interviews : 'You've got to have skills but you also need attitude' News : Conditions should suit us - McCullum News : Happy memories for Kallis in Dhaka News : Botha happy with holding role Matches: New Zealand v South Africa at Dhaka Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: New Zealand | South Africa #p#The Big Picture #p#Like the ghost of World Cups past, New Zealand have visited South Africa's campaigns in every tournament since 1992. Each time they have been clear underdogs against a team with a fabled dedication to clinical professionalism, but more often than not they reminded the South African scrooges of the frailty of a rigid formula. The timbre of those reminders has rung with increasing insistence, and when their paths crossed in 2003 and 2007, New Zealand were clear winners. #p#The lesson has been learned, and this time South Africa's progress has been notable for its break from the formulaic approaches of the past. In Imran Tahir they've found the final component in a team of near-perfect balance, and have shown a refreshing willingness to adapt as opposition or conditions demand. They have two of the best fast bowlers in the world, but both Robin Peterson and Johan Botha have opened the bowling at different stages. #p#But while South Africa's approach may have changed, there is a familiar look to their results from the group stages. West Indies, Netherlands and Bangladesh were dispatched with consummate ease. The loss to England may have raised old fears about the 'C' word, but that defeat never threatened South Africa's march to the second round and they immediately shrugged off the 'chokers' tag (a phrase that seems to be focussed on more obsessively in the media than it is by anyone in South Africa's camp) with a thrilling, last-over win against India. #p#How could New Zealand, who floundered against Australia and Sri Lanka and made the quarter-finals thanks mainly to a meltdown that only Pakistan could have delivered, possibly hope to derail the mighty South Africans? Outgunned with both bat and ball, and struggling with injuries, they will have to resort to the sort of scrapping, street-wise cricket for which their previous World Cup campaigns have been renowned. A transformed South Africa are determined to correct the mistakes of the past, but the return of Daniel Vettori will inspire New Zealand and this match could well be won by whichever team is better able to maintain temperament and composure. #p#Form guide (completed matches, most recent first) #p#New Zealand LWWWL South Africa WWWLW #p#Watch out for... #p#Imran Tahir may not be South Africa's leading wicket-taker in the tournament so far - that title belongs, surprisingly, to Robin Peterson - but his inclusion is symbolic of South Africa's new approach to limited-overs cricket. He's also their first attacking wrist spinner in a cricketing generation, and should find conditions in Mirpur to his liking. If New Zealand's top order can survive the early onslaught from Dale Steyn and Morne Morkel, Graeme Smith will turn to Tahir, confident in his ability to pick up cheap wickets with a variety of legspinners, sliders and wrong 'uns. #p#New Zealand have a couple of limited-overs stars in their ranks, such as Brendon McCullum and Jesse Ryder, but their strength as a team is their potential to gel and become more than the sum of their parts. Their captain, Daniel Vettori , is the vital ingredient in that formula. Whether with bat, ball or in the field, Vettori seems to inspire by his very presence and as a seasoned cricketer he won't be intimidated by South Africa. There have been hints that Vettori could give up ODIs after this tournament, giving him an added incentive to go out on a high. #p#Team news #p#South Africa gave away nothing in terms of likely selections or injury troubles in the lead-up to the game, and there's been no word on whether or not AB de Villiers has recovered from injury. Given the importance of the match, it's likely he will play even if not fully fit, and perhaps not be asked to keep wicket. That means wicketkeeper Morne van Wyk will keep his place in the XI, possibly at Faf du Plessis's expense. With Dale Steyn and Morne Morkel slotting back in in place of Lonwabo Tsotsobe and Wayne Parnell, South Africa will probably fill the remaining slots with their three spinners. #p#South Africa (probable): 1 Graeme Smith (capt), 2 Hashim Amla, 3 Jacques Kallis, 4 AB de Villiers, 5 JP Duminy, 6 Morne van Wyk (wk), 7 Johan Botha, 8 Robin Peterson, 9 Dale Steyn, 10 Morne Morkel, 11 Imran Tahir #p#Brendon McCullum has apparently recovered from a painful knee, and Vettori is also set to return. New Zealand have been affected by several injuries in this tournament, with Kyle Mills suffering a quad strain and Hamish Bennett's tournament ended by an injury to his ankle and Achilles tendon. Daryl Tuffey has been called up as cover, but if Mills is fit he'll be the first choice to partner Tim Southee with the new ball. #p#New Zealand (probable): 1 Brendon McCullum (wk), 2 Martin Guptill, 3 Jesse Ryder, 4 Ross Taylor, 5 Kane Williamson, 6 Scott Styris, 7 Jacob Oram, 8 Nathan McCullum, 9 Daniel Vettori (capt), 10 Tim Southee, 11 Kyle Mills. #p#Try picking the XIs for tomorrow's game by playing Team Selector. #p#Pitch and conditions #p#Both teams will know just what to expect from the Mirpur wicket, and although Graeme Smith said that he was surprised by the amount of grass on the track, it should still play on the slow, low side and aid spinners. Hot and humid weather is expected, and so dew could come into play if evening is cloudless, although its impact should be minimal. #p#Stats and trivia #p#South Africa and New Zealand have met 51 times in ODIs, with South Africa winning 30 to New Zealand's 17. Four of their matches have ended with no result. In World Cups, however, New Zealand have won three of the five matches the teams have played, and prevailed in both 2003 and 2007. #p#Jacques Kallis has more runs against New Zealand in ODIs than any other South African, having scored 1385 at 41.96, including three hundreds and nine fifties in 42 matches. #p#Tim Southee is New Zealand's leading wicket-taker in the tournament, with 14 scalps at 15.07. Ross Taylor leads their run-scoring table, with 245 at an average of 81.66 and a strike rate of exactly a-run-a-ball. #p#Quotes #p#"There are so many South Africans all around the world that if we stress about that we won't sleep at night. Things have changed a lot since Allan Donald was in the side." Graeme Smith on the Allan Donald factor. #p#"I don't have any form because I haven't played." Daniel Vettori is forthright on what he thinks about his own form.
45	507794	New Zealand v South Africa, World Cup 2011, Mirpur	Top-order batting key - Vettori	Osman Samiuddin	March 24, 2011	#p#What holds the greater weight of argument: that New Zealand do well enough to even have a side that, for the most part, plays consistently competitive cricket despite an entire population that is a third of Dhaka's alone? Or, that given the quality of players they have produced, they are actually underachieving? Stuck somewhere between those two questions, it never seems to have been any other way for them. #p#Here they are in the knock-out stages of yet another World Cup. Five times they have made it to the semis but never any further, beaten, on occasions, by a better side and on other occasions by themselves. With this side those questions have been most resonant. If they lose to South Africa on Friday in Dhaka, it won't be a surprise. If they win, it will be an upset, but a real surprise, or a shock? Not really. In any case, the attention will fall on South Africa. #p#There is no question New Zealand have players here who can change games. In their batting order are some of the cleanest, sweetest ball-hitters in world cricket; Martin Guptill's straight driving has been one of the pleasures of the group stages. Jesse Ryder, Brendon McCullum, Ross Taylor, Scott Styris and Jacob Oram should always be a threat. #p#Few fast bowlers as initially unsuited to these conditions can have progressed so much individually as Tim Southee, the influence of Allan Donald as bowling coach quite apparent. Southee is probably the least noticed fast bowling success of the tournament. Others have chipped in around him. #p#Daniel Vettori will be hoping the likes of Ross Taylor will come good against South Africa Associated Press Enlarge #p#They now have back their captain, one of the best allrounders in the game and a figure with the authority and stability most captains dream of. The majority of them field as electrically as eels. #p#And still it has been a campaign befitting them so far, unwilling to resolve those basic questions. They were awesome against Pakistan, obviously with the bat, but also in the field. The minnows were dispatched with greater comfort than some other teams were able to manage. But losses to Australia and Sri Lanka were so complete that there looked nothing of the true contenders about them. #p#In a way they have swung as much as Pakistan do, and more than this England team. Sometimes they remind you of Mark Greatbatch's withering assessment late last year that some of the players think they are better than they actually are. And there remains around them talk of player power, which never has beneficial consequences. #p#It is the batting on which the heaviest burden rests, for that is where expectations should be highest. The numbers of Taylor, McCullum and Guptill stand up well from the group stages - they've all got over 220 runs and average 81.66, 59.75 and 55.5 respectively - but in only one big game can it be said to have come together the way they want it to. #p#"We played our best game against Pakistan when the batting fired when we got a guy get through to a hundred, with a couple of crucial partnerships through it," Daniel Vettori said. "We've been at our worst when those things haven't happened. That will be the key to our success. #p#"If the top five perform it will give us a chance. We've got a very good fielding unit and a solid bowling attack so if we can complement that with a good performance with the bat we will be in with a chance. " #p#It is the potential of that top order that New Zealand are waiting on, that might take them from where they are stuck, to a different plane altogether. There isn't frustration at them not having done more so far, Vettori said, but expectation. #p#"It's not so much the frustration as much as looking forward to the next game and realizing these guys can do it," he said. "They are extremely talented and if you look at their records, as they stand alone, they are pretty good. What better time to rectify a couple of tough performances than now? We've seen the game plan that works against Pakistan, able to build a total and be able to unleash at the end. If we get a guy like Taylor, Styris or Oram in those last ten overs with wickets in hand, then we know we can be dangerous." #p#Friday would be a good time for them not simply to know that they can be dangerous, but to actually be so. Else the status quo remains.

In October last year, the Kiwis took on Bangladesh in a five-match ODI series, held entirely at the Shere Bangla stadium in Mirpur, and they lost the series 4-0, sparking off a bout of soul-searching and change in management personnel. #p#Tomorrow they take on one of the tournament favourites South Africa at the same venue for a place in the World Cup semi-final. And New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori believes familiarity with the ground may actually help his side. #p#"I think that [the 4-0 series loss] is irrelevant now," he said. "This is a quarter-final against South Africa. It's the experience of being here [that we have learnt from]. If you go to a ground in a pressure situation and you've never been there before it takes a while to get assimilated. #p#"But the guys know the ground pretty well, they're all looking forward to coming back and playing against South Africa.

We're relatively familiar with the conditions." #p#New Zealand's own form in coming through to the quarter-finals has been mixed, the stand-out result being the win over Pakistan in Pallekele. They lost both games to the group's other strong teams Australia and Sri Lanka comprehensively. But Vettori believes if his side can replicate the batting performance against Pakistan, they have a good chance of going through. #p#"If Pakistan had been the last game then we would've come here pretty confident the way we played," he said. "But our last performance was against Sri Lanka and we're disappointed with the way we played there. #p#"Hopefully we can look back on that game [against Pakistan] and try and bring that to the table. That really is the model to try and win ODI games. We've got to build those partnerships and let our aggressive guys attack at the end. If we do that then we give ourselves an opportunity." #p#Even if they do that it won't be easy against a side who are most people's favourites to win the whole tournament. South Africa lost the solitary game - a thriller to England by six runs - f as they came out top of Group B. "They've obviously played some very good cricket and been one of the form teams in world cricket for a long time," Vettori said. "They're going to be a huge challenge. We know they've got good players up and down their order. But it's about what we do tomorrow. If we can play well, we give ourselves a chance. If we don't against a team like South Africa it's going to be tough." #p#New Zealand will be boosted by the return of Vettori, having missed the last two games with a knee injury and Brendon McCullum is also expected to tough it through a continuing knee problem.
45	507832	New Zealand v South Africa, 3rd quarter-final, World Cup 2011, Mirpur	Horses for courses, and a plan for every event	Firdose Moonda in Mirpur	March 24, 2011	The plot to bowl Robin Peterson to Kevin Pietersen worked perfectly AFP Enlarge Related Links News : South Africa bank on successful strategy Matches: New Zealand v South Africa at Dhaka Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: South Africa #p#Three matches stand between South African cricket and history. Not just any three matches: three knockout matches. It's reached that stage of the tournament that South Africa has never summited before. As much as they don't want to be reminded of it, they have always looked capable of going all the way; now more so than ever, because of the new attitude and sharpness of focus that they've come into this tournament with. #p#South Africa were unusually experimental in choosing their XV, including 11 World Cup debutants, three frontline spinners and leaving out experienced finishers like Mark Boucher and Albie Morkel. Their squad was not picked based on reputation, but rather they were the 15 players that the selection committee thought would best suit conditions in the subcontinent: people who could bowl and bat against spin; combinations that would exude subtlety and not brute force; and those who were being rewarded for seasons of good form. It was a clear break away from the norm. #p#Everyone, they said, was on an equal footing; this wouldn't be an effort by 11 playing members and four water boys, but a collective mission in which everybody would be integral. The players wouldn't go on this journey alone; the coaching staff and the support staff, which includes the psychologist who was with the Springbok rugby team when they became World Champions in 2007, would be with them every step of the way. All of them arrived wearing green wristbands with, among other things, the abbreviation RAFT - resilience, adaptability, faith, trust - as a way to remind themselves of what they were coming out to achieve. #p#This is the kind of softer thinking that wasn't there before, although they were able to retain the element that made it seem as though they were preparing to go to war and there was more at stake to this than a trophy. Even when you add pride and take into account the long wait South Africa have had for this, there was something bordering on gimmicky about the build-up. #p#It may have been driven and borrowed from what happened during the football World Cup in South Africa nine months ago. Then, an initiative called Football Friday encouraged people to wear the national team jersey on Fridays, which got switched to a cricket initiative in the World Cup period. Some of the football marketing bordered on jingoistic and the marketers this time threatened to go mad again. Luckily, the team did not. #p#Their actions on the field have reflected a seriousness, dedication and commitment that have created a real reason to believe that this tournament will be different. Every match has had its standout moment or period of brilliance for South Africa; in each contest they've had a plan that's worked. #p#There was the masterstroke of opening the bowling with Johan Botha against West Indies' left-handed opening pair. He removed Chris Gayle with his third ball. There was the way they built an innings of 351 for 5 against Netherlands after a slow start, with JP Duminy's 40 off 15 balls propelling them at the end. In the third game, they exploited the weakness of Kevin Pietersen by using left-armer Robin Peterson to open the bowling, and he was able to bag not just one but three early wickets. The rest of that match didn't go according to plan and the batting collapsed on a difficult pitch, exposing what then looked like a fragile middle order. #p#Come game four, against India, that was rectified. The bowling attack had to do a powerful reining in job when the Indian batsmen got off to a flier, but then it was up to the batting to chase down a big total. AB de Villiers' half-century was the core and then Faf du Plessis, Botha and Peterson finished it off. By that stage, South Africa looked to have played the perfect game, seeing off pressure and winning when it mattered, but they didn't take the foot off the brake. #p#Against Ireland, the middle order had to perform again and then Morne Morkel's exemplary use of extra bounce sealed the match. Bangladesh saw the strength of the reserves come through, with Lonwabo Tsotsobe's opening spell showing that five weeks on the sidelines had only had an enhancing effect on his bowling. #p#Throughout the group stage, South Africa's performances have been the result of careful planning and intelligent execution. They've shown more flexibility than South African teams have ever displayed in the past. They have not been scared to innovate, to try different strategies and to take risks. More importantly, they have also been able to improvise when it's been needed most, because the ride to the top of the group has had its moments of stickiness. #p#When they lost early wickets against West Indies, de Villiers and Hashim Amla's level heads carried the chase; when they were off to a slow start against the Dutch, they left the burst for the right moment; the loss to England, on a tricky surface and in a pressure situation was turned into a positive, one the team say they have learned from and will know how to deal with when the situation comes around again; they treated Ireland and Bangladesh as a strong team should treat a lesser one; and now they find themselves three matches away from greatness. #p#Smith has said they won't change their attitudes; they'll keep playing their process-driven form of cricket and they know the results will come. They may need to change something tactically; they may need to think on their feet and adjust their game plans, as in the space of 100 overs the game will change. They may need to change with it, but from what South Africa have shown, they will.

Earlier this month Graeme Smith tweeted an article titled 'Time to ban the 'C' word'. Hold on to that thought Smith, for clearly that time hasn't come yet. South Africa were cruising at 108 for 2 in the 25th over when Jacques Kallis fell and they crash-landed spectacularly to be shot out for 172. The self-destructive streak, demonically masochistic in nature, will perhaps need shrinks to decode it. Once they realised their opponents were cracking under pressure, New Zealand went for the kill with close-in fielders and disciplined bowling, led by Jacob Oram who took four wickets and a great catch. #p#Even when Kallis fell - to a blinder of a catch from Jacob Oram, rushing to his left at deep midwicket - there wasn't much to suggest that this could turn into another contender for all-time greatest choke in World Cup history. The pitch was slow but there was no sharp turn; the bowlers were disciplined but there was no sensational game-breaking spell; none of the three spinners got much purchase from the wicket; and the total was below par; but for some reason South Africa were feeling extremely claustrophobic. #p#Their nerves were best represented by the dismissal of JP Duminy, who played an awful shot to open the choke gates. Nathan McCullum slowed up the pace on a delivery that landed on a length, outside off, and Duminy went so hard into an ugly cut that he made a complete hash of it and lost his stumps. With Duminy's fall, South Africa were in a spot of bother at 121 for 4, in the 28th over, and the first signs of something special loomed over Mirpur. #p#There was more heartbreak for South Africa fans in the next over. Faf du Plessis hit straight to midwicket and ran like a headless chicken. AB de Villiers should perhaps have refused that call but he responded, only to find himself well short of the crease. It was at this moment that New Zealand really sensed that this could be their night. #p#The moment was so ripe that even Daniel Vettori, not known for sledging, gave some lip to du Plessis and Kyle Mills, who had carried drinks on to the field at the fall of de Villiers, got into the act. A visibly agitated du Plessis shoved Mills, the departing de Villiers returned to support his partner, and eventually the umpires had to get involved. New Zealand's players swooped in to the crime scene and it was a classic Youtube moment. You could almost feel the pressure-cooker situation out there. #p#New Zealand crowded the bat with close-in men, ready to sledge and eager to pile on the pressure, and Johan Botha cracked in the 33rd over. It was a lovely legcutter from Oram and Botha played down the wrong line to lose his off stump. Oram, who was the man who started it all with that Kallis catch, wasn't done yet. In the 35th over, he lured Robin Peterson into edging an attempted cut to the keeper and South Africa were swaying away like drunken men at 132 for 7. South Africa's nerves were frayed further when Dale Steyn square drove Nathan McCullum in the air to backward point, where who else but Oram accepted the offering. #p#If Oram was the man in the forefront of New Zealand's resurgence, du Plessis was the man seeking redemption for making that wrong call that led to the run out of de Villiers. In his brief international career, he has already shown a tenacity to remain relatively calm under pressure. And he wasn't ready to throw in the towel. He was on 14 when Steyn fell, and he took ownership of the chase. He rushed down the track to slam Tim Southee to the straight boundary in the 40th over, on drove Vettori to collect another four in the 41st, and even lifted Oram for a thrilling six over long-off in the 43rd over. #p#It was in the same over that the game turned for one last time, and it was also an over that captured the entire madness of the evening. du Plessis had crashed the first delivery of the over back at Oram who couldn't hold on to a very difficult chance, and once the six was hit, one had to ask the question: was the night turning for Oram? Was it swinging towards du Plessis? But du Plessis sliced the fifth ball straight to extra cover and South Africa had well and truly sunk into oblivion. #p#The end was a far cry from the way South Africa started the day. They attacked with spin and seam, shuffled their bowlers regularly like a pack of cards, and hustled on the field to keep a tight leash on New Zealand. Jesse Ryder and Ross Taylor were at the forefront of a revival from the depths of 16 for 2; carefully, almost mindful of a potential lower-order collapse on this pitch, Ryder and Taylor battled through. The odd boundary signalled growing comfort, but they never broke away decisively. A nervy equilibrium had been reached by the end of the 30th over with New Zealand reaching 112 for 2 and the game was waiting to be seized. However, both Ryder and Taylor departed in quick succession but Kane Williamson made a vital 38 to push New Zealand to 221. #p#It shouldn't have been enough, it didn't feel like enough, but it proved enough. It was a crazy crazy night in Mirpur. Ironically, Allan Donald, the man who was involved in the other famous South African choke, was in the other camp tonight. #p#Match Timeline
45	507981	New Zealand v South Africa, 3rd quarter-final, World Cup 2011, quarter-final, Dhaka	An acrobatsman and a lucky boot	Firdose Moonda and Osman Samiuddin at the Shere Bangla Stadium	March 25, 2011	Robin Peterson took a diving catch to dismiss Brendon McCullum that was reminiscent of the way he dismissed Ian Bell earlier in the World Cup Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Report : Oram leads New Zealand to stunning upset Matches: New Zealand v South Africa at Dhaka Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: New Zealand | South Africa #p#The carbon-copy catch of the day Robin Peterson seems to have been practising moving to his left and taking superb catches off his own bowling. He first did it against England to dismiss Ian Bell and he got his chance to show off the move again in the third over on Friday. Brendon McCullum was the man who thought he could test Peterson's athleticism. He came out of the crease to drive and popped it up. Peterson launched himself to his left, got both hands under it and claimed the catch. Then came the roar and the pumping of both arms in the air. #p#The first six of the day It took more than 30 overs for the ball to be launched over the boundary, but when it came it was a good old whack. Ross Taylor, down on bended knee, pulled out the slog-sweep in some style. Peterson flighted a delivery and Taylor was happy to show him what should be done with balls like that. He got a good stride in, reached outside the line of off stump, dipped the left knee, connected wood with leather and, although it didn't reach the heavens, it had the distance and broke the tension that had been building for over 180 balls before that. #p#The party crowd Some people said only 5,000 fans would come to the Shere Bangla Stadium for the quarter-finals because the home team would not feature, but both matches have been packed to capacity. The crowd showed a genuine love of cricket, cheering on runs and wickets irrespective of which side was getting them. They even started a chorus of "Bangladesh, Bangladesh" when matters on field were getting a little dreary, and enjoyed all the music, from the Bangla beats to the South African cricket anthem, "Nkalakatha", which used to be played for Shaun Pollock. #p#The acrobatsman Kane Williamson was doing his best to gather runs at the end, playing a range of not-so-cricket shots and trying to make room for himself. Off the third-last ball of the innings, he made so much room that when he tried to get to the ball, a wide one outside off, he threw himself completely off balance. He stumbled over, did a back roll and ended up on the edge of the next pitch. And he didn't make contact with the ball. #p#The boot New Zealand needed a break early if they were going to have any chance of defending 221, but nobody could have imagined the part Brendon McCullum's boot would have played in it. Hashim Amla had already whipped two elegant drives through the covers off Brendan's brother, Nathan, before he bottom-edged an attempted cut. Unfortunately for Amla, it bounced off Brendan McCullum's boot and looped up in the air straight to first slip. #p#The spin twins A spinner opening the attack is not a novelty in the international game anymore, and it certainly hasn't been in this World Cup, where it is in danger of becoming the rule. It has been a successful move too. But New Zealand went one better tonight by opening with spin at both ends, the first time that has happened at this World Cup. It is actually only the fourth time it has happened in ODIs and, unlikely as it sounds, only Zimbabwe and New Zealand had done it before, all in the last year. Nathan McCullum struck in the first over and Daniel Vettori immediately caused a few scares, so South Africa were probably happy to see the tactic off with 27 runs and just one wicket down, after six overs of it. #p#The retro statement This was the first match in this World Cup in which neither side used a single referral. Ah, for the good old, uncomplicated days.
45	508048	Memorable South African defeats	Struggling for breath...	Liam Brickhill and Siddhartha Talya	March 25, 2011	That familiar feeling: South Africa crash out of the 2003 World Cup Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Analysis : South Africa need to face their reality Matches: New Zealand v South Africa at Dhaka Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: South Africa #p#South Africa's remarkable defeat in the Mirpur quarter-final was their fourth loss in six World Cup games against New Zealand and the fifth time they have crashed out of the tournament during a knockout stage. ESPNcricinfo looks back at some other famous defeats South Africa have slumped to in global tournaments. #p#1996 World Cup quarter-final v West Indies South Africa stormed into this game as clear favourites, having won all of their group games in the midst of a 10-match winning streak that stretched back to their home series against England earlier that year. West Indies, on the other hand, had just slumped to a humiliating loss to Kenya's amateurs in Pune, and were a team in seemingly terminal decline. The pitch was expected to take turn - and it did - but South Africa made what was, in hindsight, a fatal error in omitting Allan Donald and instead playing an extra spinner in Paul Adams. Brian Lara feasted on both Adams and offspinner Pat Symcox, carrying West Indies to 264 with a blistering hundred. South Africa may have fancied Roger Harper's and Jimmy Adams' offerings after watching their own spinners get tonked in such emphatic fashion, but they combined to take seven wickets, Harper nipping out three in one over, as South Africa collapsed from 140 for 2 to lose by 19 runs and set a trend that continues, inexplicably, to this day. #p#1999 World Cup semi-final v Australia On a midsummer's day at Edgbaston that will live in infamy - for South Africans, at least - South Africa and Australia slugged out a game of remarkable twists and about-turns, culminating in one of the most memorable finales in limited-overs history. Chasing Australia's 213, South Africa were scuppered by the single-minded intensity of Shane Warne, who took four wickets, before being brought back from the brink of oblivion by a death-or-glory innings from Lance Klusener. When he bludgeoned consecutive off-side boundaries to take the scores level with four balls remaining, the game was South Africa's to lose... and, incredibly, they did just that. Klusener ran, Donald didn't, and an ecstatic Australia took South Africa's place in the final. The tie meant that South Africa, for the third World Cup in a row, failed to reach the final despite looking like the team of the tournament in the early stages. #p#2002 Champions Trophy v India Perhaps the most remarkable of all of South Africa's crumbles in major matches. South Africa had won the inaugural version of the Champions Trophy in 1998 - their only ICC title success to date - and were coasting towards a place in the final of the 2002 edition. Having limited India to 261 for 9 in Colombo, South Africa were cruising at 192 for 1 in the 37th over, the result seemed a foregone conclusion. The easy task ahead may have prompted Gibbs to retire hurt after suffering from cramps, convinced as he may have been that the others would take his team home. But they were to let him down, and with 21 required off the final over, Sehwag survived a first-ball slog-swept six from Kallis to grab two wickets and leave the South Africans with that familiar feeling. #p#2003 World Cup v Sri Lanka The build-up to the 2003 World Cup in South Africa had been massive. Nelson Mandela had featured in the promos, Cape Town hosted a sparkling opening ceremony and this was the country's biggest sporting spectacle since the Rugby World Cup in 1995. It was to end in utter despair. The much-vaunted national team slipped up to lose against West Indies and New Zealand in the preliminary stage and their fortunes hinged on a do-or-die game against Sri Lanka in Durban. #p#That fatal run PA Photos Enlarge #p#Set a target of 269. Gibbs put them on track with an attacking 77, and even when captain Shaun Pollock was dismissed in the 43rd over to reduce them to 212 for 6 with bad weather swiftly closing in South Africa would have believed they could win. Klusener walked in but made just one in eight balls and as the weather deteriorated, a message was sent to the pair from the dressing room that the score needed to win, according to the Duckworth-Lewis method, had to be 229 at the end of the 45th over with four wickets to spare. What seemed like the decisive blow came off the penultimate ball of that over as Boucher danced out to Muttiah Muralitharan, smashed him over long-on for a flat six, and punched the air in the heavy rain, convinced that South Africa had it covered. The next ball, he gently nudged to midwicket and the umpires called for the covers. Elation was to turn to disbelief in a matter of a few seconds once the realisation dawned upon South Africa that the instructions were wrong. The score of 229 was meant for a tie, not a win. Andrew Hudson, on TV commentary, summed up the feeling. "42 million South Africans are going to bed tonight hoping it was a bad dream" #p#2007 World Cup semi-final v Australia Yet again South Africa reached a World Cup knockout, another semi-final, but this time they succumbed to nerves at the gravity of the occasion at the very start of the match rather than during a crunch finale. South Africa's stage fright took shape in a batting display that fell to pieces in wild swipes and mindless adventure. Australia showed they had well and truly won the pre-match mental battle, and the visibly skittish South Africans were demolished by Glenn McGrath and Shaun Tait before Michael Clarke's unbeaten half-century finished the job to hand South Africa their fourth knockout defeat. #p#2011 World Cup v England A game of slightly lesser importance but thrilling nevertheless, largely due to another of South Africa's incredible capitulations. The pitch at the MA Chidambaram Stadium may have been tricky but not one deserving of a score of 171, which is what England managed. Hashim Amla and Graeme Smith, in their 64-run opening stand, showed exactly that. The rest of the team, however, was adamant on proving otherwise. Carefully built-up starts were squandered and when, from the seemingly impregnable position of 124 for 3, four wickets fell for three runs in five overs the tide turned. There was still a glimmer of hope for South Africa, Dale Steyn's spirited batting bringing them to within 12 runs of victory with Morne van Wyk. But panic prevailed over determination as van Wyk was snared by Tim Bresnan, and Stuart Broad, in a superb spell, removed Steyn and Morne Morkel in four deliveries to inflict upon South Africa their only defeat, one that kept England's hopes alive, ahead of the quarter-finals.
45	508050	New Zealand v South Africa, World Cup 2011, Mirpur	The partnership that made the difference	S Rajesh	March 25, 2011	#p#After 24 overs, New Zealand were 88 for 2. At the same stage of their innings, South Africa were 108 for 2. The equation at that stage of the chase read: 114 runs required in 156 balls, eight wickets in hand, an asking rate of 4.38 runs per over, and two well-set and extremely classy batsmen at the crease. From there, it unravelled so swiftly for South Africa that even the team would be hard-pressed to explain how it happened. #p#Throughout their innings, even New Zealand didn't score their runs at a particularly brisk pace: for much of the time, the run-rate was less than four runs per over - in the 23 overs between the 13th and the 35th, they scored only 92. What they did well, though, was preserve their wickets and build a significant partnership. At the time it happened, commentators and pundits were questioning the slow approach of Jesse Ryder and Ross Taylor; their 114-run stand took 27 overs, and of the 162 balls bowled during the partnership, 91 were dots. #p#How the two teams batted between the 7th and 33rd over Team Runs Balls Wickets Dots 1s/ 2s 4s/ 6s New Zealand 114 162 1 91 54/ 7 8/ 1 South Africa 101 162 5 92 56/ 6 8/ 0 #p#South Africa's stats during the corresponding period of their innings were pretty similar in most respects - the number of runs scored, dot balls, singles, twos and fours - but the one big difference was the number of wickets lost. New Zealand's only wicket during that period was Taylor's dismissal, while South Africa lost five, from where there was no comeback. After 12 overs, South Africa were 11 runs in front of New Zealand's score at the same stage, and had lost the same number of wickets; after 33, South Africa were only two runs behind, but had lost three more wickets, and were to lose more pretty quickly thereafter. #p#Even when they got bowled out, after 43.2 overs, South Africa were only one run behind New Zealand's score at the corresponding stage, but they'd lost five more wickets. The difference was the one batting performance - and the one big partnership - which held New Zealand's innings together. Jacques Kallis and AB de Villiers threatened to replicate Ryder and Taylor's effort, but Kallis got no more than 47 compared to Ryder's 83. With no pair building partnerships after de Villiers' departure, the target became an impossible one for South Africa. #p#More stats This is New Zealand's sixth semi-final appearance in World Cups, which equals the record held by Australia and Pakistan. They've lost all five of their previous semi-finals. #p#The 114-run stand between Ryder and Taylor is the first century stand by them in eight ODI innings. In seven previous innings they'd added only 102, with a highest of 49. #p#Daniel Vettori and Nathan McCullum sharing the new ball was only the fourth time two spinners have opened the bowling for a team in ODIs. Zimbabwe have done it twice, while New Zealand tried it against India when defending 103 in Chennai last year. #p#It's Jacob Oram's first haul of four or more wickets in an ODI in five and a half years. The last time he did so was in September 2005 against India, when he took 4 for 58 in Harare. (Click here for his best bowling performances.) #p#Ross Taylor became the 12th New Zealand batsman to score 3000 ODI runs. Among those 12, only Martin Crowe has a higher average than Taylor's 36.81.
45	508053	New Zealand v South Africa, 3rd quarter-final, World Cup 2011, Mirpur	Smith in disbelief after loss	Firdose Moonda at the Shere Bangla Stadium	March 25, 2011	#p#Graeme Smith is not a small man. He towers above six foot, has shoulders broader than a lock forward, a chest that can puff out even if he is not proud and logs for legs. His personality can be even bigger: the larger than life leader of South African cricket for the last eight years, who will bat with a broken hand and will bounce back, bullish as ever, after a broken heart. Add to that the meaty guffaw and booming voice, and you have a massive character. But, on Friday night, in his last game as captain of the one-day team, he looked a small, small man indeed. #p#His gestures, usually open and friendly, were limp. His smile, usually broad, was absent. His frown, usually menacing, had been wiped off, and his eyes, usually alive, were empty. This was a man who was gutted. At the beginning of his post-match press conference, it was almost as though he was battling to speak. Each word was laboured, each breath was long. He had, perhaps a little too literally, been stunned. #p#"It's hard to describe [how we feel] at such short notice. It's kind of disbelief; I felt that we certainly had what it took to win," Smith said. Few will disagree. South Africa were the team that was talked up as the most balanced unit in this tournament. They had a plethora of options, particularly in the bowling department. It was in that discipline that South Africa shone in the group stages, as the only team to take sixty wickets in six matches. #p#Their quarter-final was the first match of the tournament in which they did not bowl out the opposition. Still, they restricted New Zealand to 221 for 8, below the average first-innings score of 236 at the Shere Bangla Stadium. Smith showed creativity in the way he rotated the bowlers and used them in short spells; they displayed control and were assisted by a superb show of ground fielding. Smith said he thought they "certainly bowled well enough to win today." #p#Graeme Smith said he could not fault the way his team prepared for the World Cup Associated Press Enlarge #p#The problem came with the bat and, inevitably, with the mind. When Smith and Jacques Kallis were laying the platform for the chase, and then again when AB de Villiers was starting to look in good touch, the win was there for the taking. When Kallis and de Villiers were dismissed, the wobble started. Two hundred and twenty two moved further and further away, and the South African middle order slipped further and further in pursuit of it. #p#"The batting let us down in the middle period," Smith said. "New Zealand squeezed us, the ball got soft and we needed to show a little more composure in that period." He didn't go as far as saying it was inexperience that cost them, but a middle order consisting of JP Duminy, Faf du Plessis, Johan Botha and Robin Peterson is only powerful if one of them can come off in a big way. Although all capable, they are relatively untested and even though they survived the pressure against India, Ireland and Bangladesh, against a rampant New Zealand, it was too much. "We lost four or five wickets quickly and it's difficult to recover on a wicket like this." #p#Small as he felt, Smith would not make others feel smaller, and even though he identified the batting as the problem in this game, he was not on a witch hunt and had no more blame to dish out. He maintained that the squad he brought to the subcontinent had given their all and even though they had fallen, they would not be weighed down by South Africa's history of exiting major tournaments in the knockouts. "We've trained hard, we worked on our skills and I cannot fault the way this team has played. When we go homes there's going to be swords and daggers. We are not the only World Cup team that has not gone on to win." #p#Towards the end of his press conference, Smith had regained some of the confidence that has become synonymous with him over the years. He was still a long way from being a large man, but he had started to show fluency and conviction in what he was saying. He was being frank and honest and that's something South African cricket will need to be after this episode. #p#It's going to be a long process of rebuilding, not the personnel, but the mindset, and Smith started it before leaving his chair. "We've just got to be honest with ourselves, that we weren't good enough tonight. Simple as that."

While probably nobody can ever fully grasp why what happens with South Africa happened again on Friday night in Mirpur, what New Zealand pulled off is easier to understand. #p#New Zealand's problems, well-documented as they are, revolve predominantly around a gifted but hasty top order. They have the shots. They are just too eager to show them off, flashing them around like hip-hoppers do their bling on MTV. Others don't even have the shots. #p#But as Jesse Ryder revealed in an interview with ESPNcricinfo before the quarter-final, John Wright has been stressing to them the importance of patience. Wright seems like the kind of man who would know about that, looking, as he does, every inch the folk singer who has seen better venues and better days, or even the careworn professor whose words only sink in over much time and then they really stay sunk. And he did work for five years as coach of India. #p#Ryder has clearly picked up something from the "six-and-out" net sessions Wright has put in place in this World Cup. He is such a beautiful batsman to watch because he makes every stroke look so different to those of other batsmen, and he doesn't move like any of them; best of all, he looks untaught. #p#His innings was such a work of unrushed regality, it felt a little decadent; him taking his time and enjoying himself, while things slowly went wrong around him. He actually seemed like one of those old, benign monarchs, whose brasher, flasher days have been left behind for something more considered, circumspect and tolerant. #p#The powers were still there, like the stand-up drive through extra cover that brought up a thousand one-day runs, or the whiplash drive off Morne Morkel that went clean through short cover. Even the inside-edge past his stumps to start him off carried some notion of unconcerned class, and this was all on a surface not made for scoring briskly. He just chose to use his powers far more discreetly, for better causes. A forgotten innings, Daniel Vettori called it later; an evocative and apt description. It set up the match, because at 16 for 2, there wasn't one. #p#"Now you look back on the match and realise it [Ryder's] was the highest score by a long distance," Vettori said. "We were 2 for 16, so we'll look back on that and look at it as the winning of the game; Jesse reining his game in a little bit and allowing himself to get in. Eighty-three off 121 balls; it was the catalyst that won us the game." #p#What sealed it was what New Zealand do, and have long done, on the field. Their bling is far better utilised and worthier here; the dives, the low-fives, the stinging direct hits, the back-handed flicks all serve a far greater purpose than the big shots. Watching them go about fielding is not much different to watching the NBA's basketball players in that it represents an acme of natural, athletic grace. It looks good there. #p#That makes up, as it did tonight, another bowler in their unit altogether. In Jacob Oram's catch and Martin Guptill's run-out of AB de Villiers, it brought them two wickets, to say nothing of the number of runs their ground fielding cut off. #p#There was patience everywhere else, particularly in the bowling of Tim Southee, Oram and Nathan McCullum. They just kept at it, Southee and Oram probing fuller lengths for longer than they might normally and waiting for batsmen to crack. Even Ross Taylor's 43 earlier was made with the greatest restraint, waiting, waiting and waiting some more before trying to go for it. At the time, both the dismissals of Ryder and Taylor felt like they had cost New Zealand, like they had been betrayed by their own endurance and lashed out. #p#But there is only so much patience can explain and bring. It cannot explain how, just last October, New Zealand were being whitewashed at this very ground by Bangladesh, were then blanked by India and lost a series at home to Pakistan, and are now in the semi-finals of the World Cup, for a remarkable sixth time. #p#For 75 overs on Friday, all that patience looked to be worth nothing. What happened after that you'll have to ask a South African. The chances are they might not be able to explain it either.
45	508059	New Zealand v South Africa, 3rd quarter-final, World Cup 2011, Mirpur	South Africa had a long tail - Vettori	Osman Samiuddin at the Shere Bangla Stadium	March 25, 2011	#p#Five months on from arguably their lowest moment on the field, New Zealand returned to the Shere Bangla Stadium and pulled off what must rank as one of their finest triumphs anywhere. Before the game, Daniel Vettori had shrugged off the significance of this venue and their 4-0 series loss to Bangladesh last year, maintaining that a World Cup quarter-final against South Africa was a different ball game altogether. #p#A shock 49-run triumph saw New Zealand into their sixth World Cup semi-final, an "amazing achievement" Vettori said for a small cricket-playing nation. "You have to move on from those things [the 4-0 loss], otherwise you will talk about them forever. South Africa, quarter-final, completely different opposition; we had experience of the ground, which suited us well and we have a team that, when it is playing well, suits those conditions, and that is what happened today." #p#With South Africa cruising at 108 for 2 chasing 222, New Zealand looked out of the game for three-quarters of it. But South Africa's long tail, starting with Johan Botha at No 7, and a pitch not as easy for batting as it may have first looked, meant Vettori believed through the chase there was a chance. #p#Daniel Vettori said it was an amazing achievement for a small country like New Zealand to have made six World cup semi-finals AFP Enlarge #p#The surface, and the occasion, he said, made 220-odd appear closer to 250. "We were desperate to get into that middle to lower order; that was our whole game plan, do whatever we can to get down there. It was always about getting past AB de Villiers. Their top four has proven themselves over a long, long time. They've got fantastic records, and I thought if we could break through that, particularly getting down to No. 6 and Botha at No. 7 meant they had a longish tail. The whole talk while we were out there and before the game was just to take wickets." #p#New Zealand will now travel to Colombo early on Saturday, where they will take on the winner of the quarter-final between Sri Lanka and England. They haven't yet gotten past the last four in five previous attempts, though. But, Vettori preferred to look at just getting there as the bigger feat. #p#"You can look at it as an amazing achievement for a country so small. That's a better way to look at it for a country of 4 million people, and we've made so many semi-finals. People will put a negative slant on it but I think it's a wonderful achievement for a country so small. #p#"It's a very happy dressing room, not only because we won a quarter-final, but because the performance we put in was very satisfying."
45	508061	New Zealand v South Africa, 3rd quarter-final, World Cup 2011, Mirpur	South Africa need to face their reality	Firdose Moonda at the Shere Bangla Stadium	March 25, 2011	JP Duminy's wild attempt at a cut shot reflected how South Africa buckled under pressure Associated Press Enlarge Related Links News : Smith in disbelief after loss Analysis : Struggling for breath... Matches: New Zealand v South Africa at Dhaka Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: South Africa #p#Choke. It's the only word that matters. After a campaign filled with renewed hope, experiments that worked, personnel changes, a new-age psychological plan and five clinical wins in the group stage, when it mattered most, nothing had changed. South Africa choked. #p#It's harsh and it's unforgiving but it's what South African cricket will have to deal with after their classic collapse against New Zealand. The crumble happened with the bat, when 108 for 2 became 172 all out. In the space of 24 balls, Jacques Kallis fell to a superb catch, JP Duminy played what may go down as the worst shot of the tournament and AB de Villiers was run out. The core of the line-up was brutally snatched out of the chase and the rest couldn't patch up the glaring hole they left behind. #p#What happened physically doesn't matter so much, though, because the real failing was in the mind. What possessed Duminy to attempt what was supposed to be a cut shot, but instead became horribly disfigured and allowed the ball to crash into his stumps? What possessed Faf du Plessis to call for a single when he had hit the ball to short midwicket, and could see a fielder swooping in? And why did he end up a third of the way down the pitch when de Villiers had not moved? Why couldn't the likes of Johan Botha and Robin Peterson get it together after the wobble and guide the team through the 100 runs they still needed? #p#Pat Symcox told ESPNcricinfo that the answer lies not in batting, bowling and fielding, but in the fourth aspect of cricket: in the mind. And at crucial times, it seems that it's the opposition who have the upperhand in that department, despite all the changes South Africa have made. The signs that South Africa are not mentally strong enough to summit a challenge like the knockouts - where they have still not won a single World Cup match in six tournaments - had never completely left. #p#A few weeks before arriving in the subcontinent, they lost the second of five one-dayers against India, at the Wanderers, from a winning position. Again, it was a batting collapse that caused the defeat, with South Africa losing 7 for 69 in chase of 191, and it exposed their fragile middle order. After that match, Graeme Smith arrived at the post-match press conference looking only a little less gutted than he did on Friday. Not one of the journalists there dared ask him the 'choking question' and he looked in no mood to answer it. It was left hanging in the air, and it was something that Smith and the squad were able to escape dealing with. #p#South Africa lost the next match in that series as well, but came from 2-1 down to win the series 3-2, and all talk of being mentally weak was shelved. They arrived in the subcontinent two weeks after their series triumph, and were greeted by a squadron of journalists who only wanted to know one thing: how will they shed the chokers' tag? It's the kind of question that buzzes about from press conference to press conference like a mosquito; it bites in all the most uncomfortable places and it's just damn irritating. But it's the one that will keep getting asked until South Africa win a major ICC trophy, and even then it will be asked in a different form. #p#From those early days of South Africa's World Cup campaign, it was evident that that question would be their bug bear. Some of the team members, like Duminy and Botha, took it in their stride and answered that they thought it was unfair they were labelled with that tag because this was a squad of fresh faces. Others didn't handle it as well. Sometimes the word choker didn't even have to be used at all; simple questions about dealing with pressure or mental conditioning would get their backs up. Their reactions said that all was not well when it came to even talking about, never mind dealing with, pressure. #p#Smith was the fieriest. He lost it in Delhi, asking a journalist who persisted in asking him how the team dealt with nerves, "So you've been out there in the middle, have you?" He was snappy and abrupt, and he shut many of the questioners up. After the first win against West Indies, the questions died down and after the thumping of Netherlands, they had almost disappeared. #p#When South Africa did the mini-choke against England, they returned. Smith was a different man that day. He arrived sombre and almost docile. He still got riled up when he was asked questions he didn't like, but his answers were less biting and more thoughtful. Something seemed to have clicked, and Smith and the team were gentler, and seemed less affected by tense situations during the games against India, Ireland and Bangladesh. They didn't even go into their quarter-final clash with New Zealand as smug as they may have, considering they topped their group and drew relatively modest opposition for the first knockout match. #p#Some said the choke was over and done with against England. Others, who steered clear of the word, said the England match had taught South Africa how to deal with that sort of pressure, and that if they encountered it again, they would know what to do. In truth, they did not encounter it again until this match. India challenged them, but they were always in control. Ireland had them against the ropes but South Africa were always just a few jabs away from a dominant position. New Zealand presented a different challenge. #p#They got their breakthroughs out of nowhere, surprising South Africa by dismissing Kallis and then de Villiers. The run-out that ended de Villiers' innings is probably what changed the game, because the body language of the New Zealand fielders changed after it. They strutted around as though they had purpose, while South Africa's batsmen were walking with their shoulders drooped and their heads bowed. #p#Some of the New Zealand players even had an altercation with du Plessis, perhaps trying to mess with his psyche by telling him he had run out his senior partner. They wanted to dig deeper into the batting line-up. Daniel Vettori, New Zealand's captain, said after the game: "There was a sense of belief that if we could get in to the South African middle order we would have a chance." #p#The England match had shown the middle order up as soft, and just as it had started hardening, New Zealand melted it. The pressure New Zealand applied was different to what any other team had, because New Zealand knew they could only win by taking 10 wickets, and so had to snuff out the middle order. New Zealand didn't back off, as India had in Nagpur; their fielding was sharp, the bowling was strangling and it was apparent they were going to hold on to their advantage with all it took. That's the kind of pressure South Africa caved under. #p#What will be important is that they accept the reality of it, that they see it for what it was - a faltering when things became too difficult - and not sugarcoat it as anything else. If South Africa are able to confront the mental aspect of the game head on, and not hide behind gimmicks, there's every chance the wounds can heal fast. The danger will arise if they don't, and if they allow the chokers' tag to be hung around their necks, while silently trying to shrug it off and publicly pretending it's not there. Then, it will become a noose again.
45	508065	New Zealand v South Africa, World Cup 2011, Mirpur	Kallis catch was the turning point - Oram	Osman Samiuddin at the Shere Bangla Stadium	March 25, 2011	#p#At the centre of a magnificent fielding performance that won New Zealand their quarter-final against South Africa were two moments. The first was an exceptional running catch on the boundary by Jacob Oram that saw the back of an unperturbed and ominous looking Jacques Kallis. The other was Martin Guptill's run-out of AB de Villiers, a few overs later and just two balls after JP Duminy's dismissal, in a short passage of play in which was crystallised South Africa's collapse. #p#Kallis was progressing in typically Kallis-like fashion on 47 when, in the 25th over, he pulled Tim Southee towards deep midwicket. Oram, Man of the Match for his 4 for 39, ran to his left and back towards the boundary rope, and with a little skip, held on to the catch face-high, still running. It looked far more impressive live than on the TV screens. It was the kind of catch that wins a quarter-final. #p#Oram's only thought when he saw the shot was to run. "The beauty of it was that it wasn't in the air that long. If it was a real skier where I had 5 or 10 seconds to think about it, I probably would've got a little bit scared underneath it. #p#"My only thought was just run, because he did hit it so well. What helped me was just the angle the ball was coming at; with a pull shot like that, it almost curls back into the angle I was running on. So I was running back and across. Thankfully I am 6'6" I replaced Kane Williamson out there who is about 4'6"; maybe it would have been a one-bounce four if he was out there." #p#Guptill's intervention came from midwicket, exploiting a tiny moment's hesitation between Faff du Plessis and de Villiers. The catch and Guptill's effort, which ended the most fluent knock of the match, were, Oram said, moments that turned the entire game. #p#Jacob Oram's running catch of Jacques Kallis started a South African collapse Getty Images Enlarge #p#"My catch [was a turning point], and I'm not just pointing that out because it's me, but because it broke a partnership that looked like it was starting to build. And the second moment which galvanised us to another level, and put the skids on them, was Martin Guptill running out AB de Villiers. That just seemed to make us all grow a foot taller, and you could see them getting a little worried." #p#There was a sustained level of excellence in the field throughout the match, from both sides. Daniel Vettori, the New Zealand captain, thought the fielding allowed them to keep the pressure up. #p#"We got a little bit of luck with the Hashim Amla wicket, and there was a great piece of work with Guptill running out de Villiers," Vettori said. "Those two things, combined with some great bowling and great fielding, allowed us to attack the whole game. The way we bowled and particularly the way we fielded, led by Guptill, probably got us through to the victory." #p#Another semi-final spot for a side that was stuttering until recently may have surprised others, but not Oram, who believes this is not the end of New Zealand's run. "Did we ever think we could make it to the semis? Of course we did and we're not finishing here, hopefully. We didn't come across here to defeat the minnows in our pool and then lose the quarter-final and go home. Why not go on and win the semi-final and take on the winner of the other semi in Mumbai in a week's time?" #p#If that eventuality does occur, Oram wouldn't mind facing Pakistan. "That's not because we're scared of India," he said. "It's because we've played Pakistan in a six-match series at home and we've defeated them in Pallekele. So we know them very well, even though they defeated us at home. But if it's India, bring them on as well."
45	508080	Memorable New Zealand wins	When the Kiwis took flight...	Nitin Sundar	March 26, 2011	#p#New Zealand's stunning win against South Africa in Mirpur is the latest addition to a list of memorable barn-storming performances from a team that has invariably brought its A-game to the big events. ESPNcricinfo looks back at some other memorable New Zealand victories in global tournaments. #p#Stephen Fleming was the protagonist when New Zealand toppled South Africa in the 2003 and the 2007 World Cups Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Matches: New Zealand v South Africa at Dhaka Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: New Zealand #p#2007 World Cup Super Eights v South Africa #p#The tournament format left New Zealand needing just one upset to make it to the last four. It came in their Super Eights game against South Africa, on a damp and dark Grenada pitch that made batting a nightmare. Shane Bond and James Franklin were close to unplayable with the new ball, as South Africa lost their openers with just three runs on the board. Jacques Kallis, Herschelle Gibbs and Ashwell Prince grafted hard to put up 193 for 7, a score that bordered on the defendable, given South Africa's pace arsenal. Stephen Fleming and Scott Styris, though, stone-walled their way to half-centuries, as New Zealand ground out a win in the 49th over. #p#2003 World Cup v South Africa #p#Having lost to Sri Lanka and forfeiting their game in Kenya, New Zealand had to upset South Africa to sneak into the Super Sixes, and Stephen Fleming's best one-day innings helped them do that. Herschelle Gibbs' energetic 143 had propelled South Africa to 306, but New Zealand came out throwing punches in all directions. Craig McMillan kickstarted the chase with typical flamboyance, but his dismissal, sandwiched between a power breakdown and a rain interruption, did little to thwart New Zealand's momentum. Fleming waded into the seamers with an array of explosive drives and cuts, and when Mark Boucher dropped him on 53, an upset seemed to be on the cards. Things got considerably easier for the visitors after a 52-minute rain break in the 31st over, that reduced the target to 226 off 39. Nathan Astle joined in the fun as New Zealand charged to a famous nine-wicket win. #p#1999 World Cup Super Sixes v India #p#With their World Cup dreams already shattered, India sleep-walked through their final Super Six fixture, much to New Zealand's joy. On a track with early movement, against a steadily incisive seam attack, India's in-form top three exited after making promising starts. Ajay Jadeja held things together and took them past 250, a score that had proved defendable in all but one game in the World Cup. New Zealand galloped off the blocks as Nathan Astle thumped anything loose, while Matt Horne scrapped a valuable 74. Roger Twose carried the baton for the middle order, but a late rain break and an unusually subdued Chris Cairns brought India back into the game. Adam Parore had plans of his own though, stealing five fours in 14 balls to win the game with ten balls to spare, and put his side in the semi-finals. #p#1992 World Cup v Australia #p#Martin Crowe inaugurated New Zealand's most consistent World Cup campaign with a measured 100 that paved the way for an upset of the defending champions in the opening game of the 1992 World Cup. Three early wickets had New Zealand in some strife before Crowe and Ken Rutherford revived the innings with a 118-run stand, setting Australia a target of 249. David Boon matched Crowe's effort with an even 100 of his own, but New Zealand's merry army of dibbly-dobblies, led by the miserly Gavin Larsen pulled the plug on the chase with ease. The win set the template for New Zealand's dominance in the group stage, that included wins against West Indies, India and England. #p#ICC KnockOut, 2001 #p#New Zealand first sprinted past Pakistan to ruin a potential India-Pakistan final clash in the ICC KnockOut, and then went on to spoil India's party with another upset in the final. Saeed Anwar scored an attractive century to set Pakistan up for a big score in the semi-final, but New Zealand restored parity through Shayne O'Connor's five-wicket haul in the end overs. Roger Twose anchored the chase of 253 with a typically gritty 87, while Craig McMillan played the finisher's role to perfection, scoring a risk-free 51 off 56 balls to set up an encounter with India. Things began to fall apart early in the final, as Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly added 141 in 26.3 overs, but New Zealand clawed their way back into the game through two run-outs. India's innings went into tailspin in the end overs, closing at 264, at least 30 runs short of what the openers had set them up for. Chris Cairns, who had missed the Pakistan game, played the innings of his life to hustle New Zealand past the finish line with two overs to spare, giving them their only piece of ICC silverware to date.
45	508097	New Zealand v South Africa, World Cup 2011, quarter-final, Dhaka	Mills, Vettori and du Plessis fined	ESPNcricinfo staff	March 26, 2011	In the midst of the fracas, several New Zealand players became involved in a heated exchange with the South Africans Associated Press Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: Faf du Plessis | Kyle Mills | Daniel Vettori Matches: New Zealand v South Africa at Dhaka Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: New Zealand | South Africa #p#Kyle Mills, Daniel Vettori and Francois du Plessis have all been fined for breaching the ICC Code of Conduct following an incident during South Africa's run-chase in their quarter-final against New Zealand in Mirpur on Friday. #p#The incident occurred at the end of the 28th over, when there was an altercation between du Plessis and some of the New Zealand players following AB de Villiers' crucial run-out. Mills, who was not in the playing XI for New Zealand, ran onto the field with drinks during the short break after the wicket and together with Vettori and several other New Zealand players became embroiled in a heated exchange with du Plessis and de Villiers, who had remained on the field to offer support to his team-mate. The exchange ended with du Plessis shoving Mills and umpire Rod Tucker stepping in between the players. #p#The disciplinary charges were laid by on-field umpires Tucker and Aleem Dar, third umpire Kumar Dharmasena and fourth umpire Nigel Llong. They were then considered by match referee Roshan Mahanama, who imposed the sanctions. #p#Mills was fined 60% of his match fee for breaching Article 2.2.4 of the ICC Code of Conduct, which is a Level 2 offence relating to "inappropriate and deliberate physical contact between players" He was also fined a further 60% of his fee for breaching Article 2.2.11 of the code, a Level 2 offence which relates to conduct that is "contrary to the spirit of the game" or "brings the game into disrepute" That means Mills, who has been ruled out of New Zealand's semi-final clash by injury and replaced in their squad, will have to pay 120% of his original match fee as punishment. #p#Vettori was fined 50% of his match fee, also for breaching Article 2.2.4 of the Code, and a further 40% of his match fee for breaching Article 2.1.8 which is a Level 1 offence that relates to conduct "contrary to the spirit of the game" or "brings the game into disrepute" Du Plessis, meanwhile, has been fined 50% of his match fee for breaching Article 2.2.4 of the code, a Level 2 offence. #p#"It was a very important time of a crucial match for both sides but there is never any excuse for deliberate physical contact in international cricket," said Mahanama. "Vettori and Mills continued to act inappropriately and contrary to the spirit of the game throughout, hence the second charges were laid against them. In determining the punishment I have taken into consideration the fact that none of these players has previously been involved in similar breaches of the code." #p#Mills pleaded not guilty to the charges and his case was thus considered in a full hearing by Mahanama in the presence of the four umpires, Mills and the New Zealand team manager. He was found guilty after Mahanama heard oral submissions from Mills and the match officials and considered video evidence of the incident. Mills has a right to appeal both findings and has 24 hours from receipt of the decision to lodge a notice of appeal. The other two players pleaded guilty to the offences and accepted the proposed sanction so there was no need for a formal hearing in respect to those charges.
45	508284	South Africa's early World Cup exit	The horror, the horror	Robert Houwing	March 27, 2011	AB de Villiers was batting like a dream, but his run-out turned South Africa's campaign into a nightmare Getty Images Enlarge Related Links News : Weak middle order cost South Africa - Kirsten News : Smith's no-show stokes fans' wrath Guest Column : The problem with South Africa News : Flawed middle order cost South Africa - Mickey Arthur Analysis : Smith the devastated captain ends it where it began Matches: New Zealand v South Africa at Dhaka Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: South Africa #p#The short- to medium-term future seems bright for the South African cricket team, whether you are talking the limited-overs formats or Tests. But a very solid chunk of their support base won't give the proverbial continental about that right now, either burying their heads in their hands in misery, or in more strident cases spewing out a stream of unflattering mantles - some of them will begin with the inevitable "c", I'm sure - for Graeme Smith and his stunned troops. #p#As a forlorn outgoing captain, Smith himself conceded after the World Cup quarter-final defeat to unfancied New Zealand in Mirpur on Friday, they will simply have to "take it on the chin" #p#Again. #p#It will be little consolation, too, that a limited yet gritty, hang-in-there outfit like New Zealand are increasingly regarded as good "tournament" material, while South Africa are somehow more accomplished by a mile as a bilateral "series" team. #p#Yet this particular South Africa squad had seemed to have just about everything at the ready in the quest to knock that theory for six; seemed to have covered so many crucial bases for the task of excelling at a World Cup on the subcontinent. #p#And for a few weeks, just for mundane record purposes now, they pretty much did. Even as he accepted the Man-of-the-Match award, New Zealand allrounder Jacob Oram described South Africa as "a damn good side" #p#Much, much earlier in the trial-by-patience contest at the Shere Bangla National Stadium, ESPNcricinfo's sharp-minded UK editor Andrew Miller had tweeted: "A bit of mystery in the spin department is what SA have been crying out for since readmission. They look frighteningly complete now." Just not quite complete enough, alas, to go all the way to World Cup glory at long last. #p#Why, even a maiden appearance in the final would have represented progress: instead the abject curse continues - this was its fifth ruinous visit - of South Africa never having won even a sole fixture in the World Cup knockout phase. #p#"Your guess is as good as mine," said poor "Biff" as Mark Nicholas, handling the televised post-match presentation ceremony, asked him (not the most opportune moment, though it was always coming, eh?) for possible reasons for this stark failure. #p#In a valiant attempt to be upbeat, Smith suggested that "in future [the team] might challenge the perception [of frailty] and get over the line" Sooner or later, it will. You would think it has to! The country has bright prospects in abundance to accompany its established, indisputable pool of world-class players. Imran Tahir has been a breath of fresh air, while we probably have not yet have seen the very best of Lonwabo Tsotsobe, JP Duminy, Faf du Plessis, Morne Morkel, Colin Ingram, David Miller and others, who generally boast ample time on their side. #p#But for the moment the post-mortem period, something South Africa's World Cup critics and observers are so used to grappling with since the bogey first reared its head in 1992, cannot be avoided. #p#How ironic that this South African team, so much more harmonious, I believe, and so much more dynamic, daring and versatile, than the class of 2007, actually tripped up one hurdle earlier than the side who turned out back then. That's cricket? Phew, she's a tough old cookie, in that case. #p#How ironic that this South African team, so much more harmonious, I believe, and so much more dynamic, daring and versatile than the class of 2007, actually tripped up one hurdle earlier than the side who turned out in the Caribbean #p#Smith led South Africa well in his ODI captaincy swansong here - sometimes outstandingly, many of sober mind will concur. The man has a phalanx of detractors (and it was forever thus) yet he won plaudits from all sorts of people, not least several of the star-studded international TV commentary team, for the new spirit in which he, and by extension his men, mostly kept the opposition guessing through flexibility, enterprise and courage of conviction. #p#I am pleased for him, in many ways, that he is gradually unbundling the cares of leadership, which may mean he can address more studiously the gremlins that wriggle up to an irksome degree in his own game. For in truth, perhaps in the underperformance at the crease of senior statesmen Smith (particularly) and Jacques Kallis lay at least one notable cause - not a whole lot else went wrong, when you think about it - of South Africa's exit at the last-eight juncture. #p#On the pitches of Asia, these were the sort of men, sporting so much street wisdom between them, who needed to bat through as often as possible, just making it that much easier for a team tally of 240 to become a 290, a 285 a 325... or even, ahem, a 172 to turn to the altogether more blissful sanctuary of 222. #p#And yet it never happened, in seven appearances apiece, even if Kallis had a better excuse as he fought cobwebs from a relatively long-term injury preceding the tournament. Smith struggled palpably for rhythm in his opening slot throughout the tournament, averaging 26 and never exceeding 45 in a single knock. He may have a fight on to keep his ODI berth as a rank-and-filer. Kallis averaged 32, but only flickered as the merciless accumulator everyone knows he can be, and his best innings was 69. Oh yes, and both "got in and got out" on the grim day they ran into New Zealand. #p#Doubts about the "bottle" of the national team when the chips are really down will be aired anew, like the forest fire that suddenly earns fresh lustre with the changing of a wind. The sniggerers will stay all a-titter. #p#Still, I don't believe this South Africa group, who overwhelmingly gave it their all and then some, deserve a rotten-tomato welcome home. Let's be gentlemen and ladies. Let's all take it on the conk, just as GC Smith and company are having to. And move on. Or at least bloody try to. #p#Aaargh!
45	508868		When a choke isn't a choke	Aakash Chopra	April 7, 2011	JP Duminy's attempt to cut a straight delivery was a case of panic setting in Associated Press Enlarge Related Links Matches: New Zealand v South Africa at Dhaka Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: South Africa #p#South Africa's capitulation against New Zealand has brought the c-word out again. Nothing seems to have changed for them in big tournaments ever since they came back to international cricket after the apartheid era. They have always had the arsenal to go all the way and yet have fallen short, always in the knock-out stages. Not a single win in knock-out games in a World Cup is a record they'd give both their arms and legs to change. #p#While their record cannot be contested, whether they choked or not against New Zealand can be debated. There's a fundamental difference between choking and panicking, which the writer Malcolm Gladwell explains quite proficiently. While Gladwell talks in the context of tennis, his theory explains choking in cricket too. #p#What happened to South Africa against New Zealand in Mirpur was a bad case of panic, though it was conveniently considered a choke. So what exactly is choking and how is it different from panicking? #p#The fundamental difference is that while you think too much when you choke, you think too little when you panic. While choking, you want to delay the inevitable, but when you panic you want to get over with it as soon as possible, for you can't bear the growing pressure. #p#Choking #p#You play safe You may finish 30 runs short of the target if the opposition bowls really well and you lose all your wickets in the bargain. On the other hand, if you get to the 50th over needing 40 runs with five wickets in the hut, that's more of a problem. Some may call it a miscalculation but it really comes down to the mindset: to play safe for as long as possible. #p#South Africa have done this more times than any other team. Remember the tied game against Australia, when Allan Donald was run out? The match would have finished much earlier had Kallis and Co. not allowed Mark Waugh to bowl a lot of overs in the middle. #p#Chasing a target is a lot about identifying threats and weak links in the opposition and then treading with caution against potential threats while going after the weak links. Playing in safe mode can take you only so far; you must change gears at some point. #p#You don't take calculated risks Yuvraj Singh could easily have dabbed the ball towards third man instead of going over the point fielder against Brett Lee in the quarter-final in Ahmedabad. Going aerial may look dicey to some but it is extremely important to take calculated risks when you're playing strong opposition. If you wait forever for things to happen, chances are you won't be there when they do. When you refuse to take these calculated risks, you run the risk of digging a hole for the team, i.e. choking. Chasing a target is a lot about identifying threats and weak links in the opposition and then treading with caution against potential threats while going after the weak links. Playing in safe mode can take you only so far; you must change gears at some point You think too much "When thinking goes deep, decisions go weak" is an old saying and it describes choking perfectly. Sport is more about instinct than intellect. Intellect is the primary requirement while planning but once the game starts, instinct must take over. You are more likely to succeed when you react, not over-think, for there's hardly any time to think too much. #p#When you over-think, you tend to think about how things can go wrong, and so you stop trusting your instincts. When you think before every step you take, you end up walking too slow. If you keep thinking about the possibility of getting stumped, you will never be able to go down the track. #p#Playing an aggressive shot is, most times, about backing yourself and trusting your instincts to go through with it. But the fear of what may happen if the shot is mistimed, or the ball bounces a bit more or less than expected, can result in a defensive prod. This is choking at a micro level. #p#I've also found that teams and individuals who are more inclined to technique than flair are more likely to choke. Their strategic and technical know-how tell them to play it safe. On the contrary, people who have a healthy mix of technique with flair - say, Pakistan - are less likely to choke. #p#Panic #p#You commit hara-kiri Panic is, in fact, the exact opposite of choking. If you play it too safe for too long when you choke, you self-destruct in fast-forward when you panic. What happened to South Africa in Mirpur was a straightforward case of panicking. There were no demons in the track and the New Zealand attack wasn't all that formidable. South Africa were cruising at 108 for 2 at the halfway stage but once they lost a couple of wickets, panic set in. When you start trying to take non-existent singles (the AB de Villiers run-out), start manufacturing shots when you only need to play percentage cricket (JP Duminy's dismissal), play reckless shots despite having a set batsman at the other end (Dale Steyn's and Robin Peterson's dismissals), it's a sign the team has lost it. #p#You abandon rational thought You think too much while choking and too little when you panic. You may need to score a run a ball, but somehow it feels a lot more than that. A couple of dot balls are followed up by a high-risk shot to ease the pressure. When you panic you tend to overestimate the pressure. A run a ball, with wickets in hand, is like walking in the park on most days, but not when you're panicking. Rational thinking deserts you the moment you panic. #p#Why did Bangladesh play silly shots when wickets were tumbling all around them against South Africa? It's common sense that if you're four down for not many, you must drop anchor, but they did exactly the opposite and tried playing ambitious shots. A six or a four can't win you the game, but you don't think along those lines when you panic. #p#Fear takes hold When you choke, you fear making mistakes, and subsequently you fail. When you panic, it is the prospect of failure that you fear, which leads to committing mistakes. The fear of failure cripples you so much that you self-destruct and bring about the failure you fear. AB de Villiers was in self-destruct mode when he took off for a non-existent single and got run out Associated Press Enlarge #p#Panic has a domino effect. It is like an epidemic that spreads through the team, while choking can be restricted to a couple of batsmen in the middle. Once panic sets in, it's quite apparent and visible to everyone, including the players in question, but choking goes unnoticed till the eventual calamity is at the door. #p#If I may draw an analogy from tennis: when a player chokes, he keeps hitting safe shots, bang in the middle of the court, ensuring they miss the net and are well inside the baseline, hoping the opponent will make a mistake. When the same player panics, he goes for non-existing winners, resulting in enforced errors. #p#The outcomes of choking and panicking may be the same but both are different from each other. So the next time you see a team lay down their arms, it might be worth looking closely to see if they have choked or panicked under pressure.
45	794393	48	Oram, South Africa and the curse			shares #p#Play 02:15 #p#"The monkey's almost become a gorilla now." Mickey Arthur's grim humour came on the back of self-inflicted wounds in Mirpur, when South Africa failed to chase down 222. #p#New Zealand needed to grasp at straws as they watched the opposition cruise to 108 for 2. Things were turned their way when Jacob Oram, returning to the XI after being dropped for the last game, dusted off his magician's cloak: he raced across, flung his massive hands over his head and snagged a full-blooded pull from Jacques Kallis that was destined for the midwicket boundary. #p#Then Faf du Plessis' senses were dulled and a suicidal run removed the other set batsman, AB de Villiers. This was no longer a stray cut. It was a gash and New Zealand kept gouging away. Kyle Mills, the substitute, jogged in with the drinks and threw in a few sledges at du Plessis. Even Daniel Vettori, whose boyish looks simply make it impossible for him to be intimidating, got in du Plessis' face. #p#Eight wickets fell for 64 runs. South Africa suffocated in a mess of tame dismissals. Oram took a haul of 4 for 39, the second-best in New Zealand's World Cup history while defending a total. "Thankfully, I am 6ft 6in, and I replaced Kane Williamson who, I think, is 4ft 6in," he said about the Kallis catch. ESPN Sports Media Ltd..
46	507984	Sri Lanka v England, World Cup 2011, Colombo	Muralitharan fit for quarter-final	Sa'adi Thawfeeq	March 25, 2011	#p#Sri Lanka received a huge boost ahead of their World Cup quarter-final match against England on Saturday when their key spinner Muttiah Muralitharan was declared fit to play. Muralitharan bruised his knee and suffered a hamstring injury while batting during Sri Lanka's final Group A fixture against New Zealand at Mumbai six days ago. #p#Sri Lanka were left worrying over Muralitharan's fitness ahead of the England match, but Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara laid to rest all the fears when he said, "Murali is fine to play and 100 percent okay, which is great for us." #p#Despite his injury Muralitharan, who had to twice leave the field for treatment, took four wickets to bowl his team to victory over New Zealand. "Murali is a guy who rises to the occasion and does really well at big games. So the side feels confident about what he can produce for us in important games," said Sangakkara. #p#Sangakkara and his team know that to it is left to them to prolong Muralitharan's one-day career for as long as possible, and at least up to the final on April 2. Muralitharan, who is the leading wicket-taker in Tests (800 wickets) and in ODI cricket (530 wickets), has announced that he is retiring from one-day cricket at the end of the World Cup. "That's exactly the way we are going to look at it and that's exactly how we are going to try and play this game," said Sangakkara. #p#"I think the rest of the guys will support each other and we will do our utmost to make sure that we do everything we want to win. It's a do-or-die for all the teams playing in the quarterfinals. Our guys are really focused and very well tuned into what's happening. They'll look to do everything they can to win," he said. #p#Muttiah Muralitharan trained the day before Sri Lanka's quarter-final against England and was confirmed fit to play Getty Images Enlarge #p#Sangakkara said that it didn't matter to his team whom they met in the quarterfinals, but if they had to win the World Cup they must compete with the best. "Whoever you meet in this format you've got to beat to win something like the World Cup. Whether we played India, Australia or England our focus is going to be the same," said Sangakkara. #p#"We aren't trying to choose who we meet in the quarters and try and adjust ourselves or that kind of thing. We are just going to enjoy every single game we play and tomorrow's not going to be any different," he added. #p#Sangakkara defended his brittle middle order which has not been tested properly in the group stages. "I think the middle order is good. They are the best players we have in Sri Lanka and some of them are equal to the best players in the world. It's hard to judge the middle order when they get only 10-15 overs in games. In the Sri Lankan side everyone is confident and everyone trusts each other. We are not only confident only in ourselves, but we are also confident in each others' ability and it's no different when it comes to the middle order. #p#"Thilan Samaraweera, Chamara Silva, Angelo Mathews and Chamara Kapugedera are the best players we have to do that job. We have done it against the best opposition in the world and they will keep doing this as before." #p#Sangakkara said there won't be any huge changes in the team composition. "We have not 100 percent decided yet. The team has performed well so there won't be any huge changes, but only where it is necessary," he said.
46	507991	Sri Lanka v England, World Cup 2011, quarter-final, Colombo	Contrasting campaigners prepare to do or die	The Preview by Andrew Miller	March 25, 2011	#p#Match Facts March 26, Colombo Start time 2.30pm (0900 GMT) #p#Graeme Swann's expertise will be invaluable for England as they seek to stifle a talented Sri Lankan batting order Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: James Anderson | Ian Bell | Kumar Sangakkara | Andrew Strauss | Graeme Swann | Michael Yardy Matches: Sri Lanka v England at Colombo (RPS) Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: England | Sri Lanka #p#The Big Picture #p#Fifteen years ago this month, England and Sri Lanka met at the same quarter-final stage of the 1996 World Cup, only for an epoch-changing contest to pan out in front of an astounded crowd in Faisalabad. With his remarkable 82 from 44 balls, Sanath Jayasuriya not only ignited Sri Lanka's charge towards their maiden global title, he signalled the end of England as a force in one-day cricket, as they failed to reach the last four of the World Cup for the first time in the tournament's history. #p#Since that match, the fortunes and expectations associated with the two teams have been flipped on their head. Sri Lanka went on to crush Australia in the 1996 final in Lahore, and have since contested a semi-final in 2003 and another final four years later in Barbados. England, on the other hand, have found a range of ignominious means to bomb out at the earliest opportunity - a trait they came perilously close to emulating this time around as well, following their embarrassments at the hands of Ireland and Bangladesh. #p#But regardless of their numerous scares along the way, England are back in the knockouts for the first time in four World Cups, and given the excitement they have served up in the past month, their Colombo encounter once again has the makings of a humdinger. It is doubtless being greedy to expect their seventh consecutive contest to go down to the wire, but the one and only constant in England's skittish campaign has been their ability to raise their game against more fancied opposition. And make no mistake, Sri Lanka on home soil present a formidable challenge - arguably the toughest assignment that any of the quarter-finalists could have landed. #p#Four years ago in the Caribbean, the Sri Lankans were by some distance the best of the rest - the only team worthy of facing Ricky Ponting's invincible Australians in the final. That they failed to bring home the spoils was no disgrace whatsoever, but while Ponting and his colleagues have since been vanquished at long last, Sri Lanka are arguably a stronger outfit than ever before. Eight of the 11 men who played in that final remain in their squad today, but crucially, sentiment has played next to no part in that fact. Two legends in Jayasuriya and Chaminda Vaas have been put out to pasture, leaving the stage clear for the likes of Ajantha Mendis and Angelo Mathews to bid for their own indelible mark on the tournament's history. #p#To judge by the narrative of their campaign to date, England will relish their underdog status - for it is a peculiar fact that of the eight quarter-finalists, they are the only side to boast an unbeaten record in matches against their fellow qualifiers. They salvaged a tie against India before out-muscling South Africa and West Indies in a pair of Chennai thrillers, and their never-say-die spirit will doubtless prove invaluable at some stage of a high-octane encounter. #p#But can sheer tenacity prevail against a team so brimful with talented campaigners? Sri Lanka's top-order triumvirate of Tillakaratne Dilshan, Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara is second only to India in terms of scorecard menace, while the breadth and variety of their attack is hard to rival - Lasith Malinga's slingers and Muttiah Muralitharan's enduring class epitomise the two extremes of a line-up that has men for all seasons and conditions. "It's going to be a significant challenge for us," remarked Andrew Strauss, never a man to cares to overstate the case. #p#At least England have had a chance to put down some roots in the course of an itinerant campaign. They've had nine days of down-time since their decisive victory in Chennai, and the past week has been spent in the pleasant environs of Colombo, where they will remain in the event of progressing to the semi-final. Nevertheless, the sad news of Michael Yardy's early departure to the UK once again speaks of a squad that is clinging on at the end of a draining winter, rather than clicking through its gears as the grandest prize draws closer. How many more "last big efforts" have they got in them? #p#Form guide (completed matches, most recent first) Sri Lanka WWWLW England WLWLT #p#Watch out for... #p#It was on England's tour of Sri Lanka in 2007-08 that Graeme Swann first showcased the skills and mindset that have since propelled him to the upper echelons of the international game. It was his first England tour since his ill-fated debut in South Africa seven years earlier, and with seven wickets at 22.28 in his four games, his determination to grasp his second chance was tangible. That refusal to surrender has driven England's sketchy challenge throughout this World Cup, even in Chittagong when a dew-sodden ball drove him to distraction. He was immense in both Chennai victories, and his touch of class will be invaluable against such potent opposition. #p#After 492 international appearances, 1343 wickets and almost 63,000 deliveries in a 19-year career, Muttiah Muralitharan is now a maximum of three matches and 180 balls from bidding farewell to the global stage. And in the event of an England win on Saturday, it will all end precisely where it began against Australia in August 1992, at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo. Murali, however, will not care a jot for such elegant symmetry - even as he approaches his 40th year, he remains as fiercely competitive and enthusiastic as ever. And, as his four-wicket haul against New Zealand last week demonstrated, his wiles cannot be trifled with, least of all by an England team whose collective performance against spin has been leaden-footed in the tournament to date. #p#Team news After a difficult tournament, Yardy was never likely to feature in this showdown, though his departure has been an understandable disruption to England's preparations, with Adil Rashid - his nominated replacement - still finding his way to Sri Lanka from the Caribbean. Tim Bresnan's troublesome calf has flared up once again, though he came through a fitness test without any visible concerns and has been passed fit for selection. Jade Dernbach, the surprise replacement for Ajmal Shahzad, has been preparing all week as if he is going to play, although James Anderson's big-match experience ought to earn him a recall following a fortnight out of the firing line. The identity of Strauss's opening partner has been confirmed within the squad, with Ian Bell believed to be the chosen man. #p#England (possible) 1 Andrew Strauss (capt), 2 Ian Bell, 3 Jonathan Trott, 4 Ravi Bopara, 5 Eoin Morgan, 6 Matt Prior (wk), 7 Luke Wright, 8 Tim Bresnan, 9 Graeme Swann, 10 James Tredwell, 11 James Anderson. #p#Fewer dilemmas for Sri Lanka to consider, especially now that Murali has been declared "100% fit" by his captain Kumar Sangakkara after struggling through the New Zealand victory with a hamstring strain. Sangakkara also acknowledged the potential weakness of Sri Lanka's untested middle order, but backed Thilan Samaraweera, Chamara Silva, angelo Mathews and Chamara Kapugedera as "the best players we have to do that job" One of the Chamaras - Silva and Kapu - seems set to miss out. #p#Sri Lanka (possible) 1 Upul Tharanga, 2 Tillakaratne Dilshan, 3 Kumar Sangakkara (capt & wk), 4 Mahela Jayawardene, 5 Angelo Mathews, 6 Thilan Samaraweera, 7 Chamara Kapugedera, 8 Nuwan Kulasekara, 9 Lasith Malinga, 10 Muttiah Muralitharan, 11 Ajantha Mendis. #p#Try picking the XIs for tomorrow's game by playing Team Selector. #p#Pitch and conditions The pitch is flat, as they generally tend to be at the Premadasa, although the threat of thunderstorms adds an extra factor to the team's preparations. Afternoon showers on the eve of the game caused the entire outfield to be covered in tarpaulins, which may just sweat a bit more moisture to the surface for the seamers. #p#Stats and trivia #p#England and Sri Lanka have faced each other on eight previous occasions in World Cup history, and though England eased to victory in each of the first five of those encounters from 1979 to 1992, they have lost two of the last three - including a thrilling two-run margin in Antigua four years ago. #p#The overall head-to-head for the two teams could scarcely be tighter. In 44 contests, England have won 23 and Sri Lanka 21. However, Sri Lanka have won eight of their last 12 encounters, dating back to 2006. #p#England did, however, achieve a notable success on their last one-day tour of Sri Lanka in October 2007 - Swann's aforementioned comeback tour. Despite losing the first game of a five-match series , they bounced back to win each of the next three for a well-deserved 3-2 victory. #p#Quotes #p#"It's not difficult for us to focus our minds on this game of cricket. It is a massive game. If we lose we're on the plane home; if we win we're in the semi-finals." Andrew Strauss believes England's off-field distractions will be of no consequence. #p#"It's do-or-die for all the teams when you get to the quarter-finals. That incentive is going to be there, and both sides will feel that intensity and that pressure equally." Kumar Sangakkara prepares for his team's biggest match of the tournament to date.

After five months on the road for England's cricketers, and six consecutive nail-biters in the group stages of the tournament, they found they had nothing left to give as the first round of knock-out matches was concluded with an utter walloping. #p#Though several higher scores have been made in this tournament to date, England's total of 229 for 6 ought to have competitive in the conditions. Only eight times in 49 internationals at the venue had a team batting second chased 230 or more for victory, and the most recent occasion came back in 2004. However, Dilshan and Tharanga battled through a tricky start with a flurry of aggression, before settling back into an effortlessly accumulative tempo. For the second time in the campaign, following on from their crushing of Zimbabwe in Pallekele, both men brought up centuries in a massive and indomitable stand. #p#Such was Sri Lanka's dominance that the match was able to finish in comically contrived scenes, as Dilshan - who had already reached his landmark with a savage cut for four off Graeme Swann - set about shepherding his partner to his own hundred. With seven runs still needed and Tharanga on 98, Dilshan accidentally carved Swann clean through the covers, and was grimacing his apologies before the ball had crossed the rope. Dilshan responded with two of the most exaggerated forward defences he has ever played, the first to a rank long-hop that even Swann was able to smile about, and with both men rendered virtually immobile with cramp, Tharanga finished the game three balls into Chris Tremlett's subsequent over, with a flat-footed swipe through the off-side. #p#The statistics told a sorry tale for England. All told they managed 12 fours in the whole of their 50 overs, two of which were scored by Jonathan Trott, whose 86 from 115 balls was his fifth half-century in seven innings, as he became the first batsman to pass 400 runs in the current tournament. Eoin Morgan provided some impetus with a 55-ball 50, but the batting Powerplay once again scuppered their momentum, as they were restricted to 23 runs and two key wickets in their five overs of fielding restrictions. Sri Lanka by contrast clobbered 22 fours and three sixes in less than 40 overs. The final result was every bit as resounding as it had been when these two teams last met in a World Cup quarter-final, at Faisalabad 15 years ago, a match that was lit up by Sanath Jayasuriya's epoch-defining 82 from 44 balls. #p#The nature of England's campaign meant that everyone, players and spectators alike, was waiting for the inevitable twist in the narrative, a fightback of the sort that the bowlers had produced against South Africa and West Indies earlier in the tournament - two other occasions in which the openers had proven hard to dislodge. However, it simply never materialised. #p#England's bowling effort started promisingly enough. Tim Bresnan found good swing in a tidy first over, while Swann spun the ball sharply after being armed with the new ball. However, Tharanga quickly decided valour was the better part of discretion, and latched onto a modicum of width to crash his first four in Bresnan's second over, before using his feet expertly to deposit Swann back over his head for six. #p#Tremlett, retained in the team ahead of the experienced James Anderson, looked set to justify his place in a brilliant first over in which he beat Dilshan three balls in a row, including a massive nip-backer that shaved the leg bail on its way through to Prior. But his line and length became scrambled thereafter, and whereas England had managed just four boundaries in their first 25 overs, Dilshan cashed in with two in four balls, both crashed through the off side, as Sri Lanka reached 57 for 0 at the end of the first Powerplay. #p#The chances that England were able to create were too marginal to be capitalised upon. Early in his innings, Dilshan survived a miscued pull off Bresnan that looped over the head of short midwicket, while Ravi Bopara came within a whisker of bowling him in his first over, only for the ball to beat everyone and fizz away for four byes. The same fate awaited a beauty of a delivery from Swann, while James Tredwell, the hero of Chennai, was tidy but unthreatening in his first three overs, before Dilshan planted his front foot to drill him into the stands at long-off. Tremlett returned to create two half-chances as the ball was drilled hard back through his fingertips, but the game was as good as over long before then. #p#At the innings break, the scenario seemed to be very different. England looked nervous and leaden-footed against a Sri Lankan attack loaded with four front-line spinners, including the Man of the Match Dilshan, who took the new ball and scalped Andrew Strauss after a dreadful innings of 5 from 19 balls. But they endured and briefly, while Trott and Eoin Morgan were in harness, they thrived, adding 91 in 16 overs for the fourth wicket. #p#However, their ambitions of a formidable 240-plus total were scuppered by the dismissal of Morgan in the first over of the Powerplay. Until he drilled Lasith Malinga at deep cover for a 55-ball 50, he had lived a charmed life, with no fewer than four clear-cut chances going his way - three dropped catches, two of them extraordinarily easy, and an lbw appeal on 29 that would have proved stone-dead on review. His luck, however, ran out at an inopportune moment for England, and when Swann missed a switch hit to fall for a first-ball duck, England proved incapable of reaching the boundary while the field was up, with just 23 runs coming in the five overs of fielding restrictions, and 56 in the last 10 all told. #p#Trott's performance was that of a man who knew that if he batted through the innings, the runs would materialise somehow. He scored his first boundary from his 65th delivery, and eventually fell in pursuit of his third, as he swept Muttiah Muralitharan to deep backward square with nine balls of the innings remaining. Despite inevitable criticism of the tempo of his innings, his sang froid appeared to be well suited to the situation, as he backed himself to work the ones and twos in a boundary-less start to his innings, and at the same time he drew a gutsy response from Ravi Bopara, who was far less comfortable with the tempo, but knuckled down for 31 from 56 balls. #p#Murali, whose legendary career has now been extended by one more game at least, finished with 2 for 54 in nine overs before limping off with an apparent recurrence of his hamstring strain. However, that tally could have been higher but for an extraordinary sequence of events in his eighth over, when Morgan was dropped twice in consecutive deliveries. He had already survived one dolly of an opportunity on 16, when Thilan Samaraweera shelled a leading edge off Ajantha Mendis at point, but Murali couldn't contain his fury when, first, Angelo Mathews at extra cover fluffed a lofted drive, before Rangana Herath dived forward at point but failed to cling on. #p#If those moments were evidence that Sri Lanka were feeling the pressure of the big occasion, they were fleeting at best. The insolent ease of this performance means that New Zealand will arrive in Colombo with trepidation ahead of their sixth semi-final appearance in ten World Cups. They have never yet progressed beyond that stage, and four years ago in Jamaica, they were sent on their way by one of the best hundreds of Mahela Jayawardene's career. Today, however, Jayawardene's solitary contribution was a catch at deep square leg. Whereas England have been on their chinstraps all tournament long, Sri Lanka - it is clear -are a team with plenty still in reserve. #p#Match Timeline
46	508147	Sri Lanka v England, 4th quarter-final, World Cup 2011, Colombo	Of broken bats and the man with nine lives	Sidharth Monga at the Premadasa	March 26, 2011	Sri Lanka's butter-fingers Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: Eoin Morgan Matches: Sri Lanka v England at Colombo (RPS) Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: England | Sri Lanka #p#The misunderstanding Jonathan Trott and Ravi Bopara did a good job of knocking the ball around later on during their partnership, but the there was the odd potential run-out thrown in too, especially because of the extensive employment of the reverse-sweep. One such effort from Trott, in the 23rd over, lobbed over Kumar Sangakkara's head, and he got so engrossed in watching over his wicket that he didn't realise the ball had reached the vacant short third-man region. Bopara wanted the run, Trott didn't, Bopara wanted it more, Trott was even more opposed, until he realised Bopara had reached his end and there was enough time for him too to make it to the other. #p#The cat At least half a cat for sure. Eoin Morgan may as well head off to the casino after the game. They just didn't seem to be capable of catching him. He was dropped by Thilan Samaraweera, Angelo Mathews and Rangana Herath, on 16, 33 and 34 respectively. In between was the usually argumentative Sri Lankan captains' failure to dispute a not-out call when Lasith Malinga had Morgan lbw on 29. Murali's reaction when Herath grassed one at point was priceless: pointing at the fielder, shouting, cursing, competitive as ever at 22 days short of 39 years. #p#The break When Morgan dug out a yorker from Malinga in the 43rd over, the ball flew square on the off side, and a piece on wood square on the leg side. On first look it looked like Malinga had bowled him, but it was a chunk of the bottom of the bat that had come off. The single that Morgan took was also his 50th run, so in one wave of a broken bat towards the dressing, he acknowledged the applause and also asked for a new piece of wood. #p#The switch-hit It went horribly wrong, by the way. England have tended to promote Graeme Swann during the batting Powerplay overs, and Swann in turn has tended to employ the switch-hit to the first ball he faces. When he came to bat in the 44th over, despite all England's unpredictability, it was clear to all who have followed the World Cup that Swann was going to try the switch-hit. Mendis bowled straight, within the stumps, Swann swung, missed, and was caught dead plumb. #p#The slip It's humid in Sri Lanka. If you didn't know it already from the two cramping centurions, go back to the highlights package, and check out Tillakaratne Dilshan's attempt at a pull shot in the 34th over of the chase. It was a good slower bouncer from Tim Bresnan, and Dilshan gave it a mighty thwack, except he didn't connect and the bat went flying towards square leg. Good that there was no square leg in place, and the umpire was deeper than where the bat landed. #p#The drama With seven runs required for a win, and Upul Tharanga on 98, Dilshan - already past his century - cut Graeme Swann for a four to send a surprised murmur across the partying stands. He had played a part in denying Virender Sehwag a century last year, surely he was not going to deny his partner one here? Two balls to go in the over. Cheekily Swann bowls short and wide, this time Dilshan goes right across, and defends to send across a wild cheer. Now Swann tosses it up, and Dilshan stretches well forward for a defensive. And all is right with the world with Tharanga on strike for the next over.
46	508196	Sri Lanka v England, 4th quarter-final, World Cup 2011, Colombo	Sri Lanka put Premadasa chasing fears to rest	Sidharth Monga at the Premadasa	March 26, 2011	Dilshan and Tharanga: The third-most prolific opening combination for Sri Lanka Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: Tillakaratne Dilshan | Upul Tharanga Matches: Sri Lanka v England at Colombo (RPS) Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: England | Sri Lanka #p#Today the R Premadasa Stadium became only the fourth ground to have hosted 100 ODIs. Yet it is a much-maligned venue, and not without reason either. It was actually a surprise that they kept playing ODIs under lights here, with the side batting first at an obvious and a significant advantage, what with the evening moisture and the ordinary floodlights deciding most of the games between evenly matched sides at the toss. The last time 230 was chased here was six-and-a-half years ago, a statistic that speaks for itself. #p#However, for the year and a half running into the World Cup, they stopped playing here. As they renovated the stands, they also tried to figure out what they could do to address that imbalance. They realised that because the ground is in a low-lying area, the moisture comes up in the evenings and assists seam movement. So they raised the square by three-and-a-half feet, and also installed new, improved floodlights. Hosting a World Cup is a matter of prestige, and nobody would have wanted two unfair knockout matches in Sri Lanka. #p#It was natural that the statistics were thrown around in the lead-up to the match. "Toss crucial," ran the headlines around the world. Meanwhile Sri Lankan players told anybody who would listen that things had changed, a glimpse of which was shown in how they had looked comfortable chasing 278 against Pakistan before losing their way. It was fitting then that on the big day the home side lost the toss, and put in a supreme performance to not only chase and win, but chase and win comfortably at that. #p#Of course they didn't win because batting second was easy. Batting was still a bit difficult; 230 was still a good target on a low and slow pitch, in a high-pressure World Cup knockout game. And they didn't win because they just batted well; their bowling was superb for the conditions, never mind the three dropped catches. More importantly, for all of England's tenacity - and they were tenacious even today for 70 overs - Sri Lanka had enough class to fall back upon and pull the opposition back. Don't forget that Muttiah Muralitharan was one of the most expensive bowlers on either side, and yet - except during the partnership between Jonathan Trott and Eoin Morgan - Sri Lanka never really looked in trouble. #p#Shrewdly they opened the bowling with Tillakaratne Dilshan, knowing England would be circumspect with their third different opening combination of the tournament. Dilshan, a smart cricketer, gave the openers little pace to work with, and by the time he was taken off, England had the uninviting prospect of facing 30 overs of specialist spin out of the 42 remaining. England played Muralitharan well, getting to the pitch of the balls and dabbing, paddling, reverse-paddling him for ones and twos. Then came a period when the game seemed to be running out of Sri Lanka's butter fingers. Three catches went down, a chance to challenge a not-out lbw call was missed, and England looked good to get even 260, which would have seriously challenged Sri Lanka, evening or no evening. #p#England called for the batting Powerplay at 182 for 3 after 42 overs, with set batsmen in the middle who had added 87 in 15 overs. Kumar Sangakkara called for Lasith Malinga. Malinga needed one loosener before firing in three yorkers followed by a slower ball that accounted for Morgan. The fielders woke up again, with Dilshan and Chamara Silva not allowing twos in the outfield and Malinga and Ajantha Mendis not allowing boundaries. Andrew Strauss admitted later that they were not allowed to play well by "a very good side" #p#Putting Dilshan and Upul Tharanga together at the top of the order has been Sri Lanka's biggest ODI investment over the last two years. Dilshan had been a middle-order batsman, and to persist with Tharanga, the team management has had to fight undue outside pressures to bring Sanath Jayasuriya back. Both were bold moves, and both have paid off: in 32 attempts the two have added 2023 at an average of 65.25, incidentally surpassing tonight the Jayasuriya-Tharanga combine to become the third-most prolific opening combination for Sri Lanka. #p#It was evident why they work so well together. When Dilshan struggled for timing in the first half hour, it was Tharanga who took the initiative and cut Tim Bresnan and lofted Graeme Swann. There was a clear understanding that Dilshan could throw things away if the runs didn't come fast enough, and that's where Tharanga came in. Once Dilshan got in, he took charge of the scoring, and in synchronicity they moved towards their centuries. #p#The freedom with which they batted proved two things. The Sri Lankan bowlers were much higher in quality, and the conditions weren't as tough as it seemed when England batted. There was the aggressive intent that is necessary to score runs on these pitches, something neither England's technique nor their loss of wickets allowed them to do. #p#Not long into the Sri Lankan innings, the stands turned into a party. The steel bands blared in every stand, the people danced, exaggerated defensive shots from Dilshan ensured there were enough runs left for Tharanga to get to his century too. Amid all that, a ground was possibly sent on redemption path too.
46	508197	Sri Lanka v England, 4th quarter-final, World Cup 2011, Colombo	'Didn't have quality to win World Cup' - Strauss	Sidharth Monga at the Premadasa	March 26, 2011	#p#It's all over now for England. They came, they entertained, they faltered when entertainment alone was not enough. There is a limit to how far refusing to lose alone can take you. On the big day, against a varied attack, England didn't have the quality to put up enough runs to defend. Andrew Strauss had no qualms in admitting that. #p#"We were not good enough in the one-dayers in either Australia or this World Cup," Strauss said. "I think we scrapped hard, and showed some fight, which is great, but didn't have enough quality to go on and win this tournament. That's the reality. #p#"I think I can't fault the energy and commitment and the desire that the guys have shown over the course of this World Cup. I think they tried their hardest today, but we were not allowed to play well by a very good side. I think you could cite tiredness, but that would be running away from the issue. Haven't played good enough cricket. Generally English teams in the subcontinent haven't played well enough to compete day in, day out. Disappointing, we have got to be better than that." #p#Strauss said the side didn't do the fundamentals required to succeed in big events. "If you look at sides that have done well in this tournament, they have got a lot of variety in their bowling attack. We haven't got as much variety as them. They have got batsmen that have consistently made hundreds. Again we haven't done that well enough. These are the stark facts in front of us, we can still go back and get better, no doubt about it. That's what we will be trying to do in the coming weeks." #p#On a ground that is statistically and historically a good friend of sides batting first, England were tied in knots by a top attack. When they had rebuilt, they were pushed back further. "We were thoroughly outplayed, we can't hide away from that," Strauss said. "We thought it was a good toss to win, we knew it was a pretty flat wicket, and probably 260-270 was more like the par score. Lost a couple of wickets, had to rebuild, but then weren't able to go through the gears in the last few overs. You have to give credit to the Sri Lankan bowlers, there is a lot of variety there. #p#Andrew Strauss: "We were not good enough in the one-dayers in either Australia or this World Cup." Getty Images Enlarge #p#"We didn't score many boundaries today. We knew our batting performance was under-par, but we thought pressure is a big man, if we can get two-three early wickets, hopefully that might be enough to make that pressure count. Unfortunately [Tillakaratne] Dilshan and [Upul] Tharanga played outstandingly well. We lost to a better side." #p#That, Strauss said, shouldn't take away from the achievements in the first half of their winter. "The Ashes was certainly my proudest moment in cricket," he said. "Probably one of English cricket's proudest moments for a long time. No one will ever take that away from us. We were very fortunate to be part of that. Since then things have been tough, there is no doubt about that." #p#World Cup failures usually come with the end of captaincy reigns and a vision to rebuild the team for the next event four years later. Strauss and England haven't thought about that as yet. "I just don't think that now is the time to answer that question," he said. "It's not something that I have thought of beforehand, I certainly have got a lot of cricket in me, full stop. You are going to have to sit down with the selectors, and look back at the tournament, and plot a way forward for both the Test side and the one-day side. We are going to have to think about what the best options are. It's something I haven't thought about, and now is not the time to think about it either." #p#However, there is a direct lesson to be learnt, and that has to do with the scheduling. "It's a huge amount to ask players to go into Australia for three months, into the highest-intensity atmosphere you can possibly get for an English team, and then go straight into a World Cup without guys spending any time at home," Strauss said. "This certainly is not good." #p#The prime example of the scheduling's effect was seen on James Anderson, who went from being England's best fast bowler to somebody who just didn't seem up for it in this World Cup. "Jimmy has had a very tough and long winter," Strauss said. "I think he got to a stage where mentally he was pretty burnt out. And you can't blame him for that. He has given everything he possibly can to the side over the course of the six months. He has been our outstanding performer, and he has run in time and time again. I think he reached the end of the road, and needed a break."
46	508226	Sri Lanka v England, 4th quarter-final, World Cup 2011, Colombo	Sangakkara eyeing all-Asian final	Sa'adi Thawfeeq at the Premadasa	March 27, 2011	#p#Kumar Sangakkara has said that Sri Lanka have every chance of making it an all-subcontinental final in the World Cup if "we keep our heads down and make sure we cover all the bases we have to cover" #p#One team from the subcontinent has made every final since 1992, and with India taking on Pakistan in the other semi-final, that trend will continue. But if Sri Lanka can beat New Zealand in the other semi-final in Colombo on March 29, it will mark the first final to feature two Asian teams. #p#"We've shown everyone what a good side we are and to do that we got to play good cricket." Sangakkara said. "Psychological advantages and all of that comes second place when it comes to playing proper cricket and good performance on the field. On Asian pitches fitness counts a lot, that's one of the major factors you got to reckon playing in this heat." #p#One of the things that have worked for Sri Lanka is their spin department headed by Muthiah Muralitharan, who is playing his last World Cup before retiring from one-day cricket. The team sacrificed the pace of Nuwan Kulasekara and went with three frontline spinners against England, and the combination turned out to be the correct one. #p#"Playing three spinners proved successful." Sangakkara said. "All the bowlers bowled well to get wickets. We made the decision in the last minute to play three spinners. Today the wicket had dried out very nicely so it made the decision very much easier. #p#"Spin is our strength but at the same time we had some wonderful fast bowlers coming through over the last two years like Lasith Malinga, Kulasekara, Dilhara Fernando, all these guys have a part to play depending on the opposition and the wickets. We try and keep ourselves unpredictable as a bowling side in this kind of tournament. We got the variety in our attack to do that." #p#Sangakkara also praised his openers, Tillakaratne Dilshan and Upul Tharanga, who both made centuries as Sri Lanka chased 230 without losing a wicket. "It requires special performance to win big games and in that aspect Dilshan and Tharanga combined to give that little spark of inspiration. They were absolutely magnificent and ruthless. #p#"They were cramping up a bit and they could have thrown it away at that time but it shows how hungry they were to do well and finish it off when they had that opportunity." #p#Dilshan opened the bowling as well and Sangakkara said it was a deliberate strategy to target the England captain. "He [Dilshan] bowls very well to left-handers and sometimes makes the new ball turn. With Andrew Strauss being a left-hander and not having a great history against spin our first option was to throw the ball to Dilshan and see whether he can do something for us. He did and on the field he's been the best in this whole tournament and his batting was just unbelievable. Today he showed as the guy who shouldered most of the responsibilities from start to finish" #p#Sangakkara stated that his side needed to improve their fielding after three easy catches were put down off Eoin Morgan, who went on to score a fifty. #p#"We got brush up on our fielding and make sure that we don't give the opposition that many chances especially one batsman and one of their key players," Sangakkara said. "Except for the three catches the rest of the fielding was pretty good. Missing catches you can't do anything about. If you miss a catch you should not let your body language go negative but stay positive and look for the next opportunity and keep charging in and stay in the game." #p#Sangakkara also said that Muralitharan would be okay for the semi-final clash against New Zealand. "He's pulled up stiff. He's had a tough couple of weeks and hopefully we'll have him 100% for our next game."
47	508369	Sri Lanka v New Zealand, World Cup 2011, semi-final, Colombo	Wright says he likes New Zealand aggression	ESPNcricinfo staff	March 28, 2011	John Wright admits that batting well will be key against Sri Lanka Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: John Wright Matches: Sri Lanka v New Zealand at Colombo (RPS) Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: New Zealand #p#John Wright, the New Zealand coach, has backed his side's aggressive approach during their quarter-final win against South Africa in Mirpur. An on-field spat saw New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori and Kyle Mills, along with South Africa's Francois du Plessis, fined by the match referee for breaching the ICC's code of conduct. #p#"I like the aggression of the team, particularly in the field," Wright said ahead of the semi-final against Sri Lanka in Colombo. "That's important. We've got to play with passion and they're showing that. The odd thing happens. But that's international sport." #p#Defending a modest 221, New Zealand put South Africa under tremendous pressure in Mirpur, by producing one of the best fielding displays of the tournament. The aggression boiled over in the 28th over of South Africa's chase, when there was an altercation between du Plessis and some of the New Zealand players following AB de Villiers' crucial run-out. Mills, who was not in the playing XI for New Zealand, along with Vettori and some other team-mates, became embroiled in a heated exchange with du Plessis and de Villiers, who had remained on the field to offer support to his team-mate. #p#Wright, however, made light of the incident. "It made reasonably interesting viewing for those out there," he said. "It happened and it was dealt with. The players on both sides knew there was a lot at stake, which is what you expect of any South Africa-New Zealand contest. #p#"I think the boys were committed, they wanted to win and made their presence felt. We're all pretty pleased right now. We did a lot of preparation for that game and achieved plenty of game-plan targets." #p#While praising the purposeful fielding and bowling efforts, Wright admitted that the batting had to lift ahead of the semi-final. "We were probably 20 runs short [against South Africa], but knew if we got 220-plus it was defendable," Wright said. "We are making up for it in the field and with the ball. We have to bat well [against Sri Lanka], that is the key for us."

Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Features : An awesome pair and the battle of flashiness Analysis : Usual suspects rise to the occasion again News : Vettori surprised at used pitch Matches: Sri Lanka v New Zealand at Colombo (RPS) Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: New Zealand | Sri Lanka #p#The Big Picture #p#In the months leading up to the World Cup, New Zealand had traipsed through the subcontinent, copping defeat after defeat: they failed to make the final of a tri-series in Sri Lanka, were hammered 5-0 in India, and between those two beatings they were humiliated in Bangladesh, where they lost 4-0. "We played like d****, really," Mark Greatbatch had fumed. They then lost a one-day series 3-2 at home to Pakistan. New Zealand were fortunate, it was said, to be pooled in Group A, from which qualification for the quarter-finals was straightforward. And after the hammerings they suffered against Australia and Sri Lanka, almost no one gave Daniel Vettori's working-class boys a chance in the first knockout against well-oiled, on-top-of-their-game South Africa. #p#Here they are, though, the only non-Asian team in the final four: a country with a population about a third of Mumbai's making the World Cup semi-finals for the sixth time, aiming to reach its maiden final. To get there, however, New Zealand will need to discover a higher gear than the one they used to upset South Africa. Their bowling will need to be as disciplined, their fielding as tenacious, their catching as game-changing, but their batsmen will have to do more. They laboured to 221 against South Africa. Sri Lanka possess cannier bowlers, experts at exploiting the home advantage, and their openers chased down England's 229, inside 40 overs. New Zealand have struggled against spin and they are unlikely to receive from Sri Lanka the generosity Pakistan showed in Pallekele. When New Zealand played their group match against Sri Lanka in Mumbai, they lost by 112 runs. That Wankhede pitch didn't turn that much either. Their batsmen will have to find a method to score more abundantly against a quality spin-heavy attack, and negotiate Lasith Malinga as well. The odds are heavily against them once again. Very few expect them to win. It is perhaps when New Zealand are most dangerous. #p#Sri Lanka will have prepared for the worst and hoped for the best. They would have prepared to face South Africa and hoped to play New Zealand instead. It is a semi-final, though, with no room for large errors, and having watched New Zealand intimidate and hustle South Africa out of the tournament, Sri Lanka will not expect anything less than all-out assault from their opponents. Mahela Jayawardene said as much. #p#On paper, Sri Lanka have this covered: a bowling attack with three specialist spinners and one part-timer (they bowled 35 overs against England), a fast bowler who is virtually unhittable when he bowls with the old ball, and an in-form top order. They, however, need to guard against two dangers. The openers, along with Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene, must ensure that the untested middle order doesn't have too much to do, and their fielding needs significant improvement. Sri Lanka uncharacteristically dropped three catches during their quarter-final. Perhaps it was the pressure, and there will be plenty of that on Tuesday. #p#Form guide (completed matches, most recent first) #p#New Zealand WLWWW Sri Lanka WWWWL #p#Watch out for... #p#New Zealand's fielding: Jacob Oram took a catch perhaps only he could have, and Martin Guptill ran out one of the fastest men in cricket, to swing the quarter-final against South Africa. New Zealand's fielders were incredible in that game, diving to cut off singles in the infield, chasing balls at furious pace, and performing tag-team saves on the boundary to allow two, where ordinarily there might have been three or four. They made their bowlers look better than they were. It's one discipline at which New Zealand will look to maximize their advantage over Sri Lanka. #p#Sri Lanka's top order : Tillakaratne Dilshan has 394 runs in this World Cup. His opening partner Upul Tharanga has 363. So does Kumar Sangakkara. They are among the top five run-scorers of the tournament and have done most of the batting for Sri Lanka. Mahela Jayawardene, who bats at No. 4, has 200 runs. No one else has even a 100. That's how little the middle-order batsmen have had to do, largely because of a lack of substantial opportunity but also because it is Sri Lanka's biggest weakness. New Zealand will go extremely hard at the top four, for exposing the middle order early is their best chance of making the final. #p#Team news #p#Muttiah Muralitharan is striving to recover from two injuries. He hurt his knee during the group match against New Zealand on March 18 and strained his quadriceps in the quarter-final two days ago. If he is fit to play the semi-final, Sri Lanka will not think ahead to the final and rest him. #p#Sri Lanka (probable): 1 Tillakaratne Dilshan, 2 Upul Tharanga, 3 Kumar Sangakkara (capt & wk), 4 Mahela Jayawardene, 5 Chamara Silva, 6 Thilan Samaraweera, 7 Angelo Mathews, 8 Lasith Malinga, 9 Muttiah Muralitharan / Nuwan Kulasekara, 10 Rangana Herath, 11 Ajantha Mendis #p#New Zealand are mulling over their spinners. To play three or not to play three, because Sri Lanka are far more skilled at playing the slow men than South Africa were. If they decide to go with only two then Luke Woodcock will miss out, and one of Daryl Tuffey and Andy McKay would come into the XI. Or perhaps James Franklin, though his inclusion ahead of a specialist bowler would significantly weaken the attack. #p#New Zealand (probable): 1 Brendom McCullum (wk), 2 Martin Guptill, 3 Jesse Ryder, 4 Ross Taylor, 5 Scott Styris, 6 Kane Williamson, 7 Nathan McCullum, 8 Jacob Oram, 9 Daniel Vettori, 10 Tim Southee, 11 Luke Woodcock / Daryl Tuffey / Andy McKay #p#Try picking the XIs for tomorrow's game by playing Team Selector. #p#Pitch and conditions #p#Vettori was surprised and upset that the surface being used for the semi-final is the same one on which Sri Lanka and England played the quarter-final on March 26. The pitch played slow during that game and it's likely to getter slower and harder to score on with repeated use. Chasing under lights used to be difficult at the Premadasa but Sri Lanka beat England without the loss of a wicket. The weather forecast is fair, with only chances of light rain. #p#Stats and trivia #p#New Zealand's batsmen played out 171 dot balls in the quarter-final against South Africa. They played out 120 dot balls in 35 overs during their group match against Sri Lanka. #p#Sri Lanka have won their previous four World Cup games against New Zealand.

They've been one of the form teams of this tournament, having lost only to Pakistan so far; they thrashed New Zealand by 112 runs in the group game only ten days ago; and they're playing at home, in conditions which should be ideal for spin bowling. #p#In contrast, New Zealand have little going in their favour. They've reached their sixth World Cup semi-final, but they've also lost each of their previous five, including one to Sri Lanka by 81 runs in 2007. The only aspect that perhaps works in their favour is the fact that Sri Lanka's batting has relied heavily on Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene, and in the last two World Cup matches between the two teams, they've both scored a hundred each - Jayawardene in Kingston and Sangakkara in Mumbai. New Zealand may feel they're due a game when neither gets a big score, and then they might get a chance to exert pressure on the others - in the Mumbai game, Angelo Mathews was the only other batsman to make a double-digit score. #p#The overall numbers, though, are strongly in Sri Lanka's favour, especially recently: since 2000, they've lost only one of eight home games against New Zealand. New Zealand have won three out of eight in World Cups, but they've lost each of the last four, since the 2003 edition. And unlike New Zealand's dismal semi-final record, Sri Lanka have won two out of three - the only one they lost was in 2003 to Australia. #p#Sri Lanka v New Zealand in ODIs Matches SL won NZ won Overall 73 33 35 In SL 19 12 5 Since 2000 33 20 11 Since 2000 in SL 8 6 1 in World Cups 8 5 3 #p#The overall stats for the two teams against the other top sides in this tournament shows the gulf, especially in the batting line-ups: Sri Lanka average more than 43 runs per wicket compared to New Zealand's 25.20.

New Zealand's big stands have come against the weaker teams, but Dilshan and Tharanga put together 231 against England, which was their second double-century stand of this World Cup, after the 282 they added against Zimbabwe. They're the first opening pair to put together two double-century stands in the same World Cup, and with Sangakkara and Jayawardene to follow, Sri Lanka's batting will again depend heavily on their top four. Apart from those four, none of the other Sri Lanka batsmen have managed 100 runs in the tournament so far. #p#The spin test One of the keys to the game will obviously be the way the two teams tackle spin. Sri Lanka are quite used to batting against spin and bowling a lot of it, but for New Zealand's batsmen, especially, it could be a huge trial. In the tournament so far, they've averaged less than 4.50 runs per over against spin, which is much lower than the rate for Sri Lanka. Taylor has been exceptional against pace, averaging more than seven runs per over, but he has fallen to spinners three times, and his scoring rate against them is less than four runs per over. Only two out of his 14 sixes in the tournament have been scored off spinners. #p#Sri Lanka and New Zealand batsmen v spin in World Cup 2011 Team Runs Dismissals Average Run rate Sri Lanka 667 12 55.58 5.57 New Zealand 619 17 36.41 4.37 #p#Ross Taylor against pace and spin in the World Cup so far Against Runs Balls Dismissals Average Run-rate 4s/ 6s Pace 174 145 1 174.00 7.20 14/ 12 Spin 114 172 3 38.00 3.97 5/ 2 #p#Sri Lanka's spinners too have been more incisive, with 26 wickets in the tournament compared to New Zealand's 11. Muttiah Muralitharan is Sri Lanka's leading wicket-taker with 13 at an average of 16.15 and an economy rate of 3.96, but New Zealand's best spinner, Daniel Vettori, has struggled for wickets. In four innings he has only managed two, and while his economy rate is excellent - he has conceded 3.60 runs per over - he averages 59.50 runs per wicket. Nathan McCullum has done a fair job of bowling with the new ball and maintaining tight control - he has taken eight wickets at 26, and an economy rate of 4.72. #p#Sri Lanka and New Zealand spinners in World Cup 2011 Team Wickets Average Econ rate Sri Lanka 26 18.50 3.63 New Zealand 11 33.54 4.22
47	508398	Sri Lanka v New Zealand, 1st semi-final, World Cup 2011, Colombo	Vettori considering three-spinner attack	Firdose Moonda in Colombo	March 28, 2011	#p#Daniel Vettori would make a bad bridesmaid. He wouldn't fit the role of the person dressed up to walk down the aisle behind someone more important. He is the important one. #p#At the best of times, Vettori is abrupt - probably not intentionally, but because it's part of his character. He is a no-nonsense kind of guy who gives a straight answer to most questions. Whether he expected to be sitting in a press conference as the only non-subcontinental team captain at the World Cup semi-finals, he won't say, but he seems rightly annoyed with being asked if his team is excited to have got this far. #p#"It's the semi-final of the World Cup, everyone is ecstatic," he said dryly. Of course they are. New Zealand have proven themselves to be one of the top four teams in the tournament. They beat the odds. After a group stage which saw them record victory over only one major team, Pakistan, and get thumped by two others, Sri Lanka and Australia, they came into the quarter-finals as one of the weaker sides. Very few people expected them to raise their game enough to beat South Africa and even when talking about that victory, very few people say that it was New Zealand who won the game. Most say it was South Africa who lost it. #p#Vettori doesn't really want to talk about that anymore, because he has more important things on his mind. "We need to move on pretty quickly from the South Africa game. We're proud of our achievement, but we need to concentrate on the semi-final." Most people paid him very little attention when he made that point, probably because most don't expect New Zealand to get past the semi-finals. That's partly because they are playing a very strong Sri Lanka side and partly because this will be their sixth World Cup semi-final, without having ever made the final. #p#'We're proud of our achievement [beating South Africa], but we need to concentrate on the semi-final' - Daniel Vettori Associated Press Enlarge #p#"Everyone wants to talk about our record [of always going out at the semi-final stage], but this is an amazing achievement for a small country," Vettori said, which hinted that he was satisfied enough with having come this far. He recovered quickly though. "We have our expectations, it's irrelevant what people say. We reached the Champions Trophy final in 2009, there we went one step further." New Zealand were horribly outplayed in that match, losing to Australia by six wickets. But, it was an important exercise for them, because they played in a final of an ICC tournament - for the first time since the 2000 Champions Trophy, which they won, beating India - and experienced the pressures of a do-or-die encounter of a different kind. #p#Vettori knows consistency is the key. "When we've won well, we've followed it up with a poor performance," he said referring to the group stage. "We've got to make sure we have another big performance in the bag because Sri Lanka will be very strong in home conditions." #p#Sri Lanka have looked the side to beat and on a pitch where they asserted their authority over England, they will be tough to handle. Vettori is toying with the idea of picking three spinners for the match. "The fact that it's a used wicket may allow us to do that, but Sri Lanka have grown up playing spin." #p#Getting their combination right for the semi-final will not be the trickiest thing for New Zealand, it will be making sure that that combination works well on the day. Vettori said that they were fortunate to have "one or two batsmen and a bowler or two who could stand up" in the knockouts. "It was Jesse Ryder and Jacob Oram who did it against South Africa. That made the difference and it may have to be someone else who does it now." #p#Vettori himself, playing in either his penultimate or final match as captain, may be the man to shoulder the responsibility. He knows it's his last chance, as he is firm in his decision to step down as captain. "I've made the decision. You need fresh ideas and people get sick of you." To leave office as the blushing bride probably doesn't quite fit his image either, but Vettori would chose to be the bride over the bridesmaid any day.
47	508405	Sri Lanka v New Zealand, 1st semi-final, World Cup 2011, Colombo	Muralitharan doubtful but Sangakkara upbeat	Sa'adi Thawfeeq in Colombo	March 28, 2011	#p#For the second match in succession, Sri Lanka are sweating over the fitness of Muttiah Muralitharan who is nursing a leg injury ahead of the semi-final against New Zealand tomorrow. "Murali and everyone around him is trying to get him as fit as possible and fit enough to play," Kumar Sangakkara said. #p#"It's no use thinking about the final and saving him for other games, this is the crunch game and if he can play tomorrow that'll be great for us, but if that doesn't work out, we've got enough cover to make sure that we are still a solid winning side." #p#"At the same time its two different injuries. He knocked his knee at Mumbai and he's just aggravated a quadricep muscle - a very slight strain - in the game before so it's not the same injury. We'll just have to monitor how he goes and hope he is fit enough to play." #p#Sangakkara said that with injuries, it was crucial to see that both the team and the player were comfortable with him taking part in the match, especially a big one like the semi-final. "If Murali is not fit it's something that we have to accept and get on with." #p#Having thrashed England by ten wickets in the quarter-finals, Sangakkara said that complacency is the last thing on Sri Lanka's radar. "There's no chance of that happening in anyone's mind. You understand the gravity of the situation, you understand the challenge that's going to come your way, you got to accept it and you got to enjoy it. #p#Muttiah Muralitharan is in doubt for the semi-final with a leg injury AFP Enlarge #p#"The guys have done pretty well and tomorrow is not going to be any different. You can't play too much to the crowds, or too much to show off, it's a question of playing good solid cricket, concentrate on doing the best. We have set ourselves small goals to achieve, if we keep our heads and we perform as well as we can, we can turn it into a solid performance." #p#"The expectations are always there, that's not something that we can control, what we really want to do is to make sure that when we go out tomorrow, we are realistic. We stay in the moment and make sure we concentrate on what we have to do and make sure our focus is 100 per cent on tomorrow." #p#Sangakkara said the win over England was made to look easy because the openers - Tillakaratne Dilshan and Upul Tharanga - came up with a magnificent batting performance. "Those kinds of partnerships don't come very often and that kind of overshadowed the contest as such. But England is a side that we were very wary of and we expected nothing less than their strong performance. In the light of that tomorrow it's a new game for us. It's nothing to do with England, we are starting from square one and we want to make sure that we understand that." #p#Sangakkara said that his team was building up momentum towards the final and that they were improving by the day. "In a tournament like this, there's never a point when you think over where you are the best. It never happens in cricket. Also in big tournaments it's always a question of gradual and continuous improvement for us. There are lots of areas we have to make sure we cover, we've done pretty much in the two days leading upto tomorrow. The guys are much focussed they are pretty confident but at the same time they understand that it is the performance that counts and that's what we are trying to deliver tomorrow." #p#Sri Lanka were second-placed in Group A in the league stage which was considered relatively easier compared to Group B but Sangakkara didn't think that was the case. "It's hard to say that we got lots of breaks in the group stages and very few breaks this time. That's not something that we can control, the schedule was set long before and we are happy that we have got here. Ours is to go one step further tomorrow." #p#Sri Lanka used three specialist spinners plus the occasional spin of Dilshan against England, but Sangakkara did not indicate what their plans were against New Zealand. "We thought that was the best combination to play against England. It was a very good track and it stayed true throughout. At the same time we have to consider other options as well. We have fast bowlers, especially Nuwan Kulasekara, who has done exceptionally well against New Zealand. So we got to make sure we play the right combination."

Besides the obvious advantage of being a right and left-hand combination, the pair have dominated seam and spin with equal disdain. Of all the opening combinations that Tim Southee has had to bowl to, this will be the most challenging. He did get the better of both in the group match between the two teams, dismissing Dilshan with a short ball and running out Tharanga. He is also New Zealand's top wicket-taker in the tournament so far, and his ability to swing the ball sets up an interesting clash with the openers. #p#Fielding v fielding Sri Lanka have been acknowledged as the best subcontinent fielding side in the competition, with their dedication resulting in spectacular catches. They've put in a special effort to stop singles in the ring and cut off any easy run flow. Now, they're up against a team whose fielding was the basis of their win in the quarter-final. Jacob Oram's catch that dismissed Jacques Kallis and the run-out which saw AB de Villiers depart were the two moments that turned the game in Mirpur in New Zealand's favour. New Zealand's fielders flung their bodies around, saving singles everywhere, to frustrate the South Africa batsmen. Sri Lanka should be prepared for the ball to hit a concrete wall and not a gap a lot of the time. #p#Lasith Malinga v Brendon McCullum This could easily be called the battle of flashiness. One has a blonde mop and an unconventional action, while the other has a tattooed upper body and a wide selection of shots. One likes to bowl flashy, the other likes to bat flashy. The most intriguing part of their battle will be Malinga's yorker against McCullum's paddle. When McCullum got an international Twenty20 century against Australia in February 2010, he repeatedly paddled Shaun Tait's yorkers up and over fine leg, often for six. #p#Sri Lanka's middle order v Daniel Vettori and Nathan McCullum The New Zealand spinners may not have as many variations as Sri Lanka's but they do have the same ability to take the game away from the opposition. Squeeze is the word they abide by, and in squeezing they get wickets; McCullum more so than Vettori, who has only two to his name this tournament but at an economy rate that a Test bowler would be proud of. Sri Lanka's middle order, from No. 5 onwards, hasn't had the best of tournaments so far, mostly because the openers haven't given them a chance to, but they're still the most fragile thing about the team. Angelo Mathews, Thilan Samaraweera and Chamara Silva will have to work hard for their runs against the two spinners, which could prove tricky considering how little time they have spent at the crease. #p#Muttiah Muralitharan v Ross Taylor This is the resumption of a battle that the wily offspinner won when the teams first met in the group stages. Taylor was on a high, having scored a century against Pakistan and a 74 against Canada. He was off to another start in the match against Sri Lanka when Muralitharan came on. Taylor wasn't able to score a run in the first six balls he faced off Muralitharan and the seventh ball trapped him lbw. Taylor hasn't fired after that and may be looking to do it here, but he'll have Muralitharan standing in his way.
47	508413	Sri Lanka v New Zealand, 1st semi-final, World Cup 2011, Colombo	Usual suspects rise to the occasion again	Sidharth Monga in Colombo	March 28, 2011	Two familiar names are in the final four once again Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Report : Sri Lanka survive jitters to reach World Cup final Features : An awesome pair and the battle of flashiness Preview : Mismatch unless NZ can raise game Matches: Sri Lanka v New Zealand at Colombo (RPS) Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: New Zealand | Sri Lanka #p#The World Cup does something to these two teams, two teams that are not financial drawcards in an immensely closed-world cricket family. It does something wonderful to them, for they keep putting in inspired performances at world events, and often feature in the last two or three matches of these tournaments. Between them, New Zealand and Sri Lanka have made seven semi-final appearances in five World Cups since 1996, the year when Sri Lanka announced themselves as world-beaters. In the last five World Cups, New Zealand have missed the final four only in 1996 and 2003, and Sri Lanka in 1999. This is the second successive World Cup semi-final they are playing against each other; hardly ever are they miserable in other world events either. Except for Australia, no other big team has that good a record over the last 15 years. #p#While the other bigger teams are often at the risk of being bogged down by expectations, or jaded and tired thanks to their tight schedules, or in certain cases not good enough, Sri Lanka and New Zealand often find their best cricket in World Cups, playing freely and purposefully. When the whole world is watching, they raise their game a notch; in New Zealand's case, against much stronger opposition. #p#There is often a message to be sent out. At least for Sri Lanka, who are still not considered a big team by many accounts. For England, Australia and South Africa, they are still the sideshows; whenever they invite Sri Lanka for a home series, it is usually before or after the main event of their home seasons, in a slot that is otherwise kept for Zimbabwe and Bangladesh. It is not that there is some discussion in Sri Lankan team meetings to this effect, but the feeling remains among the team. #p#Mahela Jayawardene agrees. "What I see is we have produced some extraordinary players," he told ESPNcricinfo. "Yes, maybe we haven't got the recognition, which is true. But it hasn't deterred us or disappointed us. We have played consistent cricket for the last 15 years, ever since 1996; 1999 was probably the only time we didn't do ourselves justice, but since 1996 everyone who has played for Sri Lanka has played with a lot of pride and passion. We have carried that through." He agrees to there being the extra motivation at world events. That while their other good performances can go unnoticed, on the world stage they get the attention they deserve. #p#New Zealand's rising to such occasions is perhaps a bit more complex. They cannot claim to have enjoyed the kind of natural talent Sri Lanka do. They have a limited pool of players to draw from, which is further crippled by recurring injuries to some of their best talent. Except for 1992, when they became a threat only once Martin Crowe's team started dominating in the league stage, they have never been favourites. As cricketers, they seem to like it when nobody gives them a chance, when people have to be proved wrong. #p#And they don't get to the semi-finals by just winning one knockout game, as the argument this time may be. In 1999 and in 2007, they went through rigorous league stages and Super Sixes / Eights and were genuinely one of the four best teams over those World Cups. Even in this World Cup, they beat Pakistan in the league stages, the only team other than New Zealand to have beaten two title contenders so far. Leading into this World Cup, though, New Zealand were sleepwalking through whitewashes at the hands of Bangladesh and India, at venues the World Cup would be played at. #p#Somehow, as they have done in the past, New Zealand have found enough fire and will to make their sixth semi-final in 10 World Cups. There is nothing tangible that explains the transformation. Yes, the coach has changed, but to put it all down to John Wright and Allan Donald would be to do injustice to the players who have put recent disappointments behind them. As Daniel Vettori said, "Look, John [Wright] has been fantastic for us. The players took the blame for those losses, and I think they should get credit for the wins as well. It has to be a combination of the two." #p#Tomorrow one of these proud teams will bow out. It is a stage that should ideally get the best out of them. Sri Lanka once again will want the world to look at them when everybody is so engrossed in the other semi-final that they have to request journalists at press conferences to refrain from asking questions about the India-Pakistan game. New Zealand have even more people to prove wrong, for once again they are massive underdogs. More so than against South Africa, because Sri Lanka are likely to neither relent nor break. And they are at home. #p#Whatever the result be, it is good to see the unusual usual suspects in the final four once again.
47	508414	Sri Lanka v New Zealand, 1st semi-final, World Cup 2011, Colombo	Vettori surprised at used pitch	ESPNcricinfo staff	March 28, 2011	#p#Daniel Vettori, the New Zealand captain, is not impressed with the use of the same pitch for Tuesday's semi-final as the one that was used for the quarter-final against England on Saturday. "They've told us we're playing on the same one as England, which is very surprising for us," Vettori said on the eve of the first semi-final against Sri Lanka. "Playing a World Cup semi-final on a used wicket; we would have thought it would be mandatory to prepare a fresh wicket, but obviously not." Sri Lanka won their quarter-final easily, strangulating England's scoring through clever use of slow bowlers and Lasith Malinga at the death, and went on to win comfortably by 10 wickets. #p#Vettori is spot on with his observation that it is not mandatory to play a semi-final on a fresh pitch. However, the pitch to be used for the semi-final is relatively fresh; it was used for the first time in the tournament during the quarter-final. The call on which pitch is to be used is the groundsman's, and Anuruddha Polonowita, Sri Lanka's chief groundsman, said that he has chosen the most-fair strip. #p#An ICC source said the choice of the exact pitch remains with the venue, as long as it complies with the ICC's guidelines for fair pitches. The choice, the source said, was between the pitch used for the Australia-Pakistan game and the one used for the quarter-final. The first one had more inconsistent bounce, hence this pitch was chosen.

However, the closing stages were fraught in the extreme as a raucous home crowd was forced to postpone a party that had been in full swing for more than three-quarters of the contest. #p#Defending a mediocre total of 217 after a spirited batting effort had unravelled in a clatter of late wickets, New Zealand's lust for a scrap kicked in with a vengeance just when it seemed the match was finally out of their reach. At 160 for 1 in the 33rd over, with Tillakaratne Dilshan and Kumar Sangakkara entrenched in a game-breaking partnership of 120, what little attention had been on this, the less glamorous of the two semi-finals, had already begun to drift towards Wednesday's epic match-up in Mohali. #p#But then Dilshan, cruising on 73 from 93 deliveries and seemingly destined for his second hundred in consecutive matches, slapped loosely at Tim Southee and picked out Jesse Ryder at point, whose second catch of the innings was a far less breathtaking affair than his earlier one-handed pluck off Sri Lanka's pace-setter, Upul Tharanga. #p#Three balls later, the new man Mahela Jayawardene was beaten in flight by a beautiful dipping delivery from Daniel Vettori and nailed plumb lbw for 1, whereupon Sangakkara's habitually cool head deserted him, as he attempted to steer the lively Andy McKay over the keeper for four, but ended up dollying a simple chance to Scott Styris at third man. #p#Sri Lanka had lost three wickets for eight runs in 22 deliveries, and just as had been the case in the throttling of South Africa, New Zealand's bowlers ramped up the aggro while maintaining supremely disciplined lines and lengths. On the same worn wicket that had been used for the England quarter-final, runs suddenly became excruciatingly hard to come by as Sri Lanka's untested middle order was fully exposed to the limelight. #p#Chamara Silva and Thilan Samaraweera scraped together nine runs in six overs as the asking-rate climbed to close to five, and it took a message from the dressing room, delivered with a drink from Dilhara Fernando, to persuade them out of their defensive mindset. Silva responded with two fours in consecutive deliveries as Ryder's seam-up was brought into the attack, but three balls later he tried to get aggressive against the extra pace of Southee and chopped onto his own stumps for 13. #p#Muttiah Muralitharan was chaired off the field after his final match on home soil AFP Enlarge #p#Samaraweera, however, had the experience to see his team home. A short ball from Ryder was fetched over midwicket for four, before a wild throw from Oram gifted him another four as the ball sailed over the keeper's head. Another error lopped five more precious runs off the total as a McKay wide slipped through the keeper's grasp, and though McKay responded with a beauty to Angelo Mathews that was sent to be reviewed for caught-behind, the lack of Hot Spot meant there was no evidence available to reverse the on-field decision. #p#And with a smoking six off Southee in the next over, the game was finally relieved of its tension - even though it took two winning shots to seal it, after Mathew's initial carve through the covers was called a dead-ball due to a firework exploding right at the moment of delivery. Instead, Samaraweera nudged through third man to wrap up the game with 13 balls to spare. #p#Such a nerve-jangling finale could not have seemed further from the agenda while Sri Lanka's innings was in full flow. From the moment Tharanga launched his third ball, from Nathan McCullum, straight down the ground for six, Sri Lanka were always ahead of the asking-rate. His departure for 30 from 31 balls did change the tempo of the Sri Lankan innings, but neither Dilshan nor Sangakkara had any reason to rush towards a modest victory target. #p#Sangakkara had an early let-off when he edged Oram at a catchable height through the vacant slip cordon, while Dilshan - who had been so combative against England - took 28 deliveries to score the second boundary of his innings, and his 50th of the World Cup to date. But he went on to pass 400 runs for the tournament, en route to overtaking Jonathan Trott as the leading run-scorer, and as Sangakkara finally began to nail his trademark cover-drives, New Zealand looked to have run out of ideas. #p#In hindsight, the Kiwis will look back on the closing stages of their own innings with regret, for a late collapse of 5 for 13, including 4 for 4 in 12 balls, undermined much of the good work they had put into the early part of their innings. The bed-rock was provided by Scott Styris, a centurion against Sri Lanka in the 2007 World Cup, who ground out a responsible 57 from 76 balls. But when he was extracted lbw by the final delivery that Muttiah Muralitharan will ever bowl on home soil, Sri Lanka responded euphorically to scythe through the tail and leave seven precious deliveries unused. #p#Whether a 240 target would have made any difference will remain a matter for conjecture. Though they fared better than any other team in the tournament so far in taking 41 runs off Sri Lanka's bowlers in the batting Powerplay, they were ultimately undone by the depth and variety of their attack, with Lasith Malinga's yorkers scalping three key wickets at critical moments. #p#Too many of New Zealand's batsmen made starts without going on. Martin Guptill flicked Malinga's fifth delivery through midwicket in a 65-ball 39, only for Malinga to york him superbly when he returned for his second spell, while Brendon McCullum slog-swept Rangana Herath for six, only to be bowled for 13 playing the exact same stroke. Taylor, whose ferocious hitting could have been so valuable at the death, launched a Mendis long-hop straight to deep midwicket just when he looked ready to build on his 36 from 55 balls. #p#But as Vettori takes his leave of the New Zealand captaincy, he can reflect on yet another campaign in which his team rose to the challenge of the big event in precisely the manner that too many of their supposed betters - namely England and South Africa - consistently fail to do. Sangakkara and his men, meanwhile, march on to their second final in consecutive World Cups, where Muralitharan - his broken body notwithstanding - will attempt to complete his career on the highest high imaginable. #p#Match Timeline
47	508564	Sri Lanka v New Zealand, World Cup 2011, semi-final, Colombo	Murali's fitting run across the home stretch	Sidharth Monga in Colombo	March 29, 2011	Muttiah Muralitharan's perfect home farewell would have been incredibly contrived had it not been for real AFP Enlarge Related Links Features : Emotions run high in tight game Players/Officials: Muttiah Muralitharan Matches: Sri Lanka v New Zealand at Colombo (RPS) Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Sri Lanka #p#"It would have been incredibly contrived had it not been for real," this reporter wrote on July 22, 2010, just having watched Muttiah Muralitharan end his Test career with a wicket off the last ball, No. 800, also the last wicket in the match. At 792 wickets, Murali had announced the Galle Test would be his last. If 800 happened it would be good; if 800 didn't happen, so be it. How could 800 not happen? #p#At his beloved Galle International Stadium, a ground he had help rebuild after the 2004 tsunami had ravaged it, there was a cloud coming from the distance, Lasith Malinga was off injured, Sri Lanka were racing against time to finish India off, and the last wicket had frustrated them for 15 overs. In his 27th over of the day, Murali produced the final wicket. #p#About a year later, having agreed to delay his ODI retirement for the World Cup, Murali had fought a hamstring injury, a side strain, a troublesome knee and groin when it was suggested that he be preserved for the final and not be risked in a home semi-final against New Zealand, not fancied to beat the hosts on a sluggish surface. Rubbish. There is no way you could keep Murali out of his last match at home. If he could stand straight, he would play. And play he did. #p#The build-up, as expected, was not as big as Galle. Firstly ODI cricket doesn't allow such elaborate farewells, and then Sri Lanka were just two matches away from a World Cup win, and this was just his last match at home, and not necessarily his last match. The relief around in Colombo was palpable when it was announced Murali was fit to play. Just enough, it turned out. For in the sixth over he went off the field, and came back in the 11th. Still Murali, clearly not at his best, even on one leg, is presence enough. As soon as he had spent the four overs on the field to become eligible for a bowl, Murali gave it a twirl. #p#Round the wicket he started, and landed the first ball on the spot. In his third over, a big offbreak, not the best delivery he has bowled to take a wicket, bounced on Jesse Ryder, and New Zealand's match-winner from the quarter-final was gone. The ascendancy gained, Sri Lanka went ahead to apply the squeeze, and once again it ceased being all about Murali. New Zealand rebuilt through Scott Styris and Ross Taylor, and then asked for the Powerplay in the 42nd over. #p#Murali was brought back in the second Powerplay over. Now a 20-year-old kid, playing his 19th international match, served a reminder that a bad ball from Murali is still a bad ball. It was a levelling over actually. Kane Williamson employed the old trick on the master: came down and lofted him over mid-off one ball, and rightly guessed a short ball next and rocked back to cut it for four. Nathan McCullum hit him for a six in his next over, the ninth. #p#Murali's last match at home could not have ended in a whimper. He had one more over left, majority of which was bowled to the set Scott Styris. The Premadasa Stadium was awake to it. The Sri Lanka flags were raised in the stands, it seemed like a single long Sri Lanka flag, as long as the stadium's circumference, ran across the stands. For old time's sake, perhaps, Murali went back to bowling from over the stumps. For one last over at home, he started bowling the big offbreaks, reminiscent of the pre-doosra days. He even bowled a wide that turned too much down the leg side. The fourth ball of the over turned sharply into the pads, Styris tried to nudge it for a single, but there was no way a nudge was going to beat the two men square on the leg side. Same with the fifth ball. He knew he was bowling to his field, and knew Styris would need to take a risk to score off him. #p#Styris, more experienced than Williamson, was showing more reverence; he would have experienced much more Murali wrath than Williamson. He just wanted to see Murali off, and would take the single if he got it in the process. Murali ran in for his last ball at home, and bowled a bit wide, turning it back in, and hitting Styris in front. LBW. A wicket that kickstarted a collapse of 4 for 4. #p#It would have been incredibly contrived had it not been for real.
47	508569	Sri Lanka v New Zealand, 1st semi-final, World Cup 2011, Colombo	Malinga's magic and Ryder's Leverock moment	Firdose Moonda in Colombo	March 29, 2011	Dwayne Leverock, eat your heart out. AFP Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: Dwayne Leverock | Jesse Ryder Matches: Sri Lanka v New Zealand at Colombo (RPS) Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: New Zealand | South Africa #p#The corker yorker Lasith Malinga was always going to target the toes of the New Zealand batsmen and the delivery he got Martin Guptill out on was the most attractive yorker of the lot. It was a perfect inswinging ball that would have taken exemplary defence and the ability to the bat down at just the right moment to keep out. Guptill didn't time it badly, but he didn't time it perfectly and that was what made the difference. He was properly corked, the stumps were out of the ground and Malinga's poison had worked. #p#The first and the last He was far from a fully fit man and even thought he was hobbling, the crowd were ecstatic when Muttiah Muralitharan came on to bowl. It would be his last match on Sri Lankan soil and every ball was cheered. The anticipation for a wicket grew with every ball and after two overs, it came. The ball received a thin edge off Jesse Ryder's bat and found itself nestled in Kumar Sangakkara's gloves and the stadium stood up. Every fan was off their feet, every pair of hands was being slapped together, ever face was smiling, as though they never wanted his spell to end. A few hours later, it had to. Murali lined up to bowl his last ball in ODI cricket for his country and it caught Scott Styris on the pad. The decision was reviewed but it was upheld and Murali sauntered off the home stage with a wicket. The clapping was thunderous and the smiles were huge, the biggest smile came from the man himself. #p#The fabulous fielding Sri Lanka lived up to their reputation of being the best subcontinental fielding side at the tournament with a committed display of groundwork. Tillakaratne Dilshan, in his white floppy hat at mid-off, was one of the best. He pounced on balls that were played awkwardly to him, stopping singles when he could easily have let the batsmen hurry through. Off an over from Rangana Herath, the 39th of New Zealand's innings, Dilshan did it three times, all athletically, all saving one. #p#The Leverock moment He is not quite as heavy as Dwayne Leverock, but the earth probably still moved when he took the catch that may become the catch of the tournament. Upul Tharanga and Tillakaratne Dilshan were looking comfortable enough for another century stand, the bowlers were getting irritable and the boundary balls were mounting. Tim Southee bowled one, short, wide and cuttable and Tharanga obliged. Up went the ball, but only as far the leaping Ryder. He was at full strength, poised like a ballerina and he times his move perfectly. Thud. He was back down to earth, ball in hand, wicket claimed. #p#The effortless boundary Which one? Dilshan and Sangakkara were feasting off the fours at will and looked as though once they'd decided which shot to play, they'd play it no matter what or who was in their way. Dilshan was doing it with almost no care in the world and when Daniel Vettori put two gullies on the offside, he didn't care. Dilshan drilled the ball between the both of them, timed so well that neither would have got to it if they'd move, so it's probably just as well they didn't. #p#The silencer As the middle order marched one by one to the crease, the feeling in the Premadasa Stadium become more and more nervy. Then, Chamara Silva had an audacious attempt at cutting a short ball and in his haste found a bottom edge on to his stumps. Tim Southee's toothy grin said that New Zealand knew they were putting up enough of a fight. The stillness of the crowd said it even louder. The singing, dancing, cheering masses went eerily quiet, but not for long. #p#The premature ending Sri Lanka still needed four runs to win the match when a fireworks display started around the stadium. The last two overs had to be bowled with the sound of firework going off all around and it proved a distraction, in more ways than one. Umpire Aleem Dar called a dead ball before Andy McKay delivered the first ball of the 48th over, which neither McKay, nor Thilan Samaraweera saw. McKay bowled, Samaraweera sent it through the covers for four and started celeDbrating but was stopped by Dar's signal. The players looked perplexed, thinking the match was over but it wasn't. Four balls later, it was. And the fireworks went mad.
47	508604	Sri Lanka v New Zealand, World Cup 2011, semi-final, Colombo	Vettori pragmatic after defeat	Firdose Moonda in Colombo	March 29, 2011	#p#The Daniel Vettori who turned up at the post-match conference after the semi-final was not the Daniel Vettori that was expected to turn up. He was not grumpy, annoyed or irritable. He was not overly disappointed, he did not look like his world has crashed around him, or even like a small part of it was destroyed. #p#For the sixth time, New Zealand have exited the tournament at the semi-final stage and they have never reached a World Cup final. Vettori would have had every right to appear upset, heartbroken and gutted, as he looked on the field when Thilan Samaraweera hit the winning runs. By the time the media conference came around, 15 or so minutes later, he had dried his eyes and put the loss in perspective. "I can only speak for this team, I can't speak for the teams of yesteryear and we just came up short," he said, pragmatic as you like. #p#The coming up short started with the bat. New Zealand lost 6 for 25 runs at the end of their innings, including a dramatic 4 for 4, and were bowled out for 217. Already, they knew they were on the ropes. "We thought we were 20 to 30 runs short," Vettori said, although he maintained that he had made the correct decision by choosing to bat first. "Our top order came up short and against the Sri Lankan bowling it was tough to recover." #p#Despite a below-par batting performance New Zealand - known for their ability to fight, and just four days after defending 221 in spectacular fashion against South Africa - may have gone into the field thinking they would do it again. For that, they would need the batting side to play along, but Sri Lanka were no South Africa, and made it difficult for New Zealand to repeat their giant-killing performance. "Our whole game plan was to try and get them three down," Vettori said. #p#New Zealand go out, not embarrassed or humiliated, but like their captain, proud of about what they achieved AFP Enlarge #p#By the time that three down happened, Sri Lanka were only 57 away from victory and had formed enough of a solid base for the rest of the order to build on. Kumar Sangakkara was still at the crease, looking as composed as ever and the inroads New Zealand made were not enough to cause an upset. "The [Tillakaratne] Dilshan and Sangakkara partnership went on too long," Vettori said of the 120 runs the pair put on for the second wicket. #p#That was the partnership that put the match beyond New Zealand's reach and the only way they could get it back was to grab and pull with all they had. "When the opposition has to chase at less than 6 runs to the over, you have to get wickets and we were all about taking wickets and breaking partnerships. But we couldn't break the sixth wicket partnership." That stand, of 35 runs, between Samaraweera and Angelo Mathews won the match for Sri Lanka but had it been broken, it would have opened up the tail for New Zealand. #p#Mathews joined Samaraweera at the crease with the score on 185 for 5, still needing 33 to win and with the required-rate nudging its way towards a run a ball. Southee had just completed a maiden over but instead of applying pressure on the other end as well, Vettori allowed Jesse Ryder, who had just conceded nine runs in his first over, to continue. "I needed to get through some overs, Jesse was in the game already," Vettori explained. #p#He was not going to go as far as laying blame on anyone, even young Southee, who persisted with short balls towards the end of the Sri Lankan innings, which the Sri Lankan were not too afraid off. "Short bowling is a good plan but you have to bowl in the right areas. Tim Southee has had a great tournament and I can't blame him." Vettori has praise for the whole team's effort saying he was "impressed" with the way they fielded. #p#If there was a hint of sadness in going home and not to Mumbai, he didn't let it show. Perhaps it's because the performance the team had in this World Cup has been better than the showing they've had in the last nine months, when they lost four ODI series to subcontinental sides. Perhaps because it gives him such a boost to be able sign off from the captaincy on this note, knowing that the team has regained its ability to fight. #p#"Obviously we are incredibly disappointed. We fought so hard to stay in the tournament," he said. It was that determined fight that sees New Zealand go out, not embarrassed or humiliated, but like their captain, proud of about what they achieved and realistic about what they hope to do in the future.

Sometimes it can do both at the same time. Tonight was a night when sport hurt and uplifted in equal measure. #p#As Thilan Samaraweera's outside edge bisected the wicketkeeper and slip to win Sri Lanka the semi-final, the whole New Zealand team sank to their knees; something just left them, the spirit that had kept them alive when they had no business being alive had now gone. For the first time on a humid, sapping day, they looked tired. For the sixth time they had lost in a World Cup semi-final. As they walked off the field, having shaken the winners' hands, they quietly shook hands with their support staff who had come to the edge of the dressing room, and were no doubt impressed by the fight the players had put on for the last three hours. The players' faces told a different tale, though. They wanted more than just that honourable defeat. #p#Around them, a party had begun. In fact it had begun in earnest. Moments before those winning runs came, Samaraweera had thought he had got them through a much more convincing strike through the covers. It turned out Aleem Dar had been distracted by the fireworks outside the stadium just as the bowler passed him, and had called it a dead ball. Mahela Jayawardene, running for Angelo Mathews, couldn't believe it. The hands went up, the shoulders were shrugged, even though a win was near-certain, with four runs required off the last three overs. The tension had surely become too much to take for him. New Zealand had put up one hell of a fight. #p#As Samaraweera's outside edge bisected the wicketkeeper and slip, the whole Sri Lankan team rushed onto the field. Inside the dressing room they had sat tense from the moment New Zealand started clawing their way back. A Sri Lankan flag sat over each players' seat, which they themselves bring and place before every match. Muttiah Muralitharan was padded up to come next, ahead of his batting order, because he wanted to finish it off. This was Murali's last match at home, and he had earlier signed off with a wicket off his last delivery. The pads could be taken off now, and his team-mates lifted him on the shoulders and carried him around the ground. Every time Murali thought the noise in the stands had gone down a notch, he raised his arms asking for more. The crowd responded every time. #p#Kumar Sangakkara, their captain, would put the victory in context. "Cricket has healed all wounds in Sri Lanka," he said. "Whenever cricket was played, it seemed life was normal. We carry that responsibility with us whenever we play." It is a huge responsibility for a sport to carry, and not ideal, but that's how it has turned out to be. The life tonight was indeed normal. The bands played, the people danced, the fireworks went off as the proud cricket team thanked them. The noise was deafening, who could blame Dar for having pulled out of that delivery? #p#Some time before Samaraweera managed those winning runs, there was a huge appeal for a caught-behind against Mathews. He was not given out. New Zealand challenged the call. Poor technology, which is a shame for an event for this magnitude, didn't give New Zealand a fair chance to get it overturned. Sitting with a ball in his hand on an icebox behind the fine-leg boundary, Allan Donald lost his patience. #p#Donald, the great bowler and competitor that he was, never made it past a World Cup semi-final as a player. Tonight, as New Zealand's bowling coach, he was almost as involved as the players out on the field. He was just as desperate as the players diving all over the field. He made sure the bowlers fielded close to him, constant chat happened, advice and ideas exchanged. When the final runs came, he finally got up, shuffled the ball from his left hand to his right, then from right to left, then from left to right, gathering himself, then under-armed it to nowhere particular on the field, and went to shake the hands of the victors and the vanquished. #p#Unlike football, where World Cup knockouts invariably end in similar scenes, neither the victors flung their shirts over their heads, nor did the vanquished shed a tear. The joy and the disappointment ran deeper. Yet the emotion could be felt, for not every knockout game in cricket World Cups makes for such a mix. This one needed a fight from the underdogs, and the favourite's ability to take the punches. This was a special game of cricket. #p#Sri Lanka, through the sheer quality of their side, had strangulated the New Zealand batting, and were on their way as their top three kept things under suitable control. New Zealand, who didn't quite have the bowlers to run through a mentally strong Sri Lankan side, kept fighting, kept refusing to die, and pounced on the first opening they got. They converted one wicket into two, two into three, three into four. Against a team much higher in quality and with varied weapons, through their sprit and their fielding, they had made it clear the road to final will go over their diving bodies, and that included Jesse Ryder's, who has often been ridiculed for his weight and his drinking. #p#If that was what it would take, Sri Lanka would do it. They would bring New Zealand down to their knees. The final shot summed it up. Behind Samaraweera's raised arms was Ross Taylor with his weight on his knees and his face in his hands; a distraught Ryder from point would have seen Mathews celebrate at square leg; Daniel Vettori, playing his last match as captain, finally took his Black Cap off and went to congratulate Jayawardene. You felt sorry for New Zealand, you felt happy for Sri Lanka. You felt sport.
47	508658	Sri Lanka v New Zealand, semi-final, World Cup 2011	Sangakkara praises middle-order	Sa'adi Thawfeeq	March 30, 2011	#p#Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara praised his brittle middle-order batting for carrying his team to the final of the World Cup after they beat New Zealand by five wickets in Colombo on Tuesday. Chasing New Zealand's moderate total of 217, Sri Lanka were cruising to victory at 160 for 1 when a sudden top-order collapse - four wickets fell for 25 runs - left them looking vulnerable, before the experience of Thilan Samaraweera and the flair of Angelo Mathews (batting with a runner due to a thigh strain) saw Sri Lanka through. #p#"The middle order won the match for us. I don't think it's anything to worry about," an elated Sangakkara said. "I always said if you give them the opportunity they would deliver. They got it today in very tense circumstances. We are very happy what they've done." #p#Samaraweera and Mathews added 35 crucial runs for the sixth wicket to carry Sri Lanka to their second successive World Cup final. They will meet the winners of Wednesday's second semi-final between India and Pakistan in the final on Saturday. Sangakkara blamed himself for not seeing Sri Lanka through to victory after the openers had got them off to a rapid start once again. #p#"The responsibility should have been on me and [Tillakaratne] Dilshan. Dilhan did his job and I should have seen the match through. I played one shot too many and our dismissals put a lot of pressure on the middle order and they came out very well. #p#"We got tensed in the end basically because Dilshan and I should have finished it off or got as close as possible at least to the 200 mark. We let that opportunity go and put the side under a bit of pressure. Dilshan batted brilliantly, he and Upul (Tharanga) gave us another great start. Upul was out to a fantastic catch by Jesse Ryder when he was batting beautifully. #p#Sangakkara: The middle order won the match for us. I don't think it's anything to worry about. AFP Enlarge #p#"My job was to hang around with Dilshan and build a partnership, but with two down and 60 runs to go on hindsight it was good for the middle order to show us what they can do as well. Thilan did exactly what was expected of him, Chamara Silva chipped in and Angelo Mathews as usual finished it up for us." #p#It was the second time in successive knockout matches that Sri Lanka had chased and won under lights. "We won two matches chasing because we lost the toss not because of anything else. If we had won the toss we would have batted first," Sangakkara said. "Chasing and winning does a lot more for your confidence than batting first and defending because you got the bowling attack to defend. You just need to see off ourselves how well we do in a chase especially in two crunch games. I thought New Zealand adapted to the conditions a lot better. #p#"They always have the variety to trouble us at home because they have the bits and pieces cricketers and quality spinners. But today the wicket was really great it didn't take a huge amount of spin and actually the seam bowlers were a bit more difficult to attack than spin." #p#Reaching a World Cup final was the culmination of a long journey and careful planning, Sangakkara said. "We planned for it for over two years. We missed a great opportunity in 2007. Ours was to recreate those opportunities in 2011 and to be there is very special for us. If we had not won the World Cup in 1996 we wouldn't have come to this level. We must thank players like Murali [Muralitharan], Vaasy [Chaminda Vaas], Sanath [Sanath Jayasuriya], Aravinda de Silva and Arjuna [Ranatunga]. #p#"From that winning side only one member is with us and that is Murali. The amount of input he has given to us we cannot measure. If you take his bowling and his character he has played a big part in our cricket. Not only the players but the rest of Sri Lanka look at him as someone special." #p#The game was Muralitharan's final appearance in an ODI at home and he was rightfully given a lap of honour at the end of the match. "It was a bit emotional because it was the last game we were playing in front of our home crowd. The next match is not going to be here. It was a very special moment for us and even more so because it is the last time Murali will ever play an ODI. When the magnitude of that occasion hits you it kind of overwhelms you." #p#In his farewell Test against India last year, Muralitharan took his 800th wicket with the last ball he bowled in Test cricket. Against New Zealand, he again took a wicket off the final ball he bowled in his final ODI appearance at home. #p#"The good thing about Murali is he has no ego and he is a great team man," Sangakarra said. "Why these kind of fairytale endings keep happening to him is because he is a great human being. He has a great heart, he is an honest hardworking guy and he has no pretenses about it. When he is such a nice guy good things happen to him." #p#Looking ahead at the final on Saturday, Sangakkara said, "Kicking off from here it is easy to get carried away. We won a semi-final but we haven't won a final. We are in the final, we need to keep our heads down and keep playing good cricket. There is a lot of work to do in the next three days to play in the biggest match of our lives. #p#"It means a great deal especially in a new future that is envisioned for Sri Lanka. For us to be in this position, to host a World Cup and for the Sri Lankan team to get into a final it bodes well for the future of our country. Cricket's always been the panacea that's healed all wounds in Sri Lanka. Whenever cricket is played it seems as if life was back to normal. We carry that responsible job and it has been with us whenever we played. We understand the gravity of work but we also understand what privilege it is to be able to represent our country. #p#"Every single match we play is for our country. What people outside don't see is the greatest pride we have when we don our national colours. You go to the dressing room and there is a national flag with every player above their seat before we go out to play."
47	508659			Guyanga Weerasekera		Choice of game For a country where superstar musicians like Bryan Adams and ABBA only come to perform well into their retirement, any place that gathers more than 30,000 people is either a political rally or a cricket match. With no political influence at Kyazoonga, I managed to win two tickets through their ballot process, and then who wouldn't choose this game, eh? #p# Team supported Just typing "Sri Lanka" is an understatement. I rooted for SRI LANKA. #p# World Cup prediction Sri Lanka have the edge, with good temperament of the top order and the bowling unit. #p# Key performer Tillakaratne Dilshan sneaked in with, first a wicket from five overs, and then an important 73. #p# One thing I'd have changed Mr Chamara Silva. Tim Southee did the home crowd a favour when he bowled Silva out for a depressing 13 from 25. #p# Face-off I relished After Ross Taylor won the Shoaib Akhtar battle, I was waiting for the Taylor-Malinga face-off. Taylor just got one boundary off Malinga and was beaten by Mendis later on. It was not quite what I hoped for. #p# Wow moment Jesse Ryder's crazy catch to send Upul Tharanga back. For those few seconds, I forgot which team I was supporting. #p# Close encounter Tharanga's family and friends were sitting in front of me, and coincidence or not, the man himself was stationed at the boundary in front of us. He turned to us and waved and the whole section of the crowd went nuts. #p# Shot of the day The injured Angelo Mathews' 47th-over six. His lofted on-drive could not have come at a better time. After Silva's lack of heroics, Mathews made the final sprint over the finish line. #p# Crowd meter There were some South Africans (who had presumably booked tickets in advance), Pakistanis (probably got the semi-final days mixed up), Indians (because Indians are everywhere) and only about 35,000-odd Sri Lankans. They came in all shapes and sizes, gave the great Murali the biggest cheer he could get when bowling his final over in Colombo. There were some high-profile fans in attendance too, including Mahinda Rajapaksa, the Sri Lankan president. #p# Entertainment The PA system kept the crowd going, but it was the local papare bands, in full flow, who were the main attraction. If you haven't heard the papare, you haven't been to Sri Lanka. #p# ODIs v Twenty20 The ODI is like a ten-course meal, while Twenty20 is like KFC. An ODI requires technique, talent and temperament, whereas a Twenty20 only needs Yusuf Pathan. ODIs are Mercedes Benzes where the Twenty20 is a Subaru STI. #p# Bye bye Colombo I'm definitely going to miss the World Cup action in Colombo. I truly believe this was the best World Cup so far. It had its fair share of upsets, but the favourites pulled through. Paring future World Cups down to 10 teams will only hurt the game; 12 should be ideal: divided into four groups of three, with two teams qualifying from each group to play the quarter-finals. #p# Now I can't wait for the Twenty20 action to begin here next year. #p# Marks out of 10 8.5. Dilshan, Murali, Sangakkara and Ryder were largely responsible. #p# Overall A World Cup semi-final, with the host team in full flow - what more can we ask for? Great fielding kept the Kiwis in the contest till the last few minutes, and in the end Sri Lanka pulled through. An unmatchable World Cup experience.

He had earlier decided to step down as New Zealand captain following the World Cup, and his one-day plans remain unclear, though he is committed to playing Tests. #p#"I may take a break but this might not be my last one-dayer for New Zealand," Vettori said, after his team's five-wicket loss to Sri Lanka in the World Cup semi-final in Colombo. "I've played my last Twenty20 match (though)." #p#New Zealand's next one-day assignment in Zimbabwe is still six months away and Vettori said that gave him "lot of time to sit down and think about it [retiring from ODIs] and talk to my family" However, he confirmed that he will continue to play Test cricket. #p#"Tests are a big part of why I play the game, for team and myself, because there is no better feeling than winning a Test." #p#Tuesday's defeat to Sri Lanka was New Zealand's sixth World Cup semi-final loss, but Vettori said there were many positives to emerge from their campaign. "The batsmen are starting to develop and understand their roles," Vettori said. "Of the players at this tournament, I was pleased with the likes of Ross Taylor, Jacob Oram and Tim Southee. Nathan McCullum, in particular, also grew as a bowler. #p#"There will be different stages of grief between those beginning and ending their careers [about the World Cup result] but this is a catalyst for a lot of guys to get better and better." #p#Vettori has captained the side in 32 Tests, 82 ODIs and 28 Twenty20 internationals. Taylor has stepped in as captain in Vettori's absence in recent times, but New Zealand Cricket are yet to announce a full-time successor.
48	508565		An encounter to stop a subcontinent	Peter Roebuck	March 30, 2011	Yuvraj: the big ticket AFP Enlarge Related Links Matches: India v Pakistan at Mohali Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: India | Pakistan #p#A cricket match can hold only so much weight. In that regard the forthcoming semi-final, a local derby as well, and a tussle between sometimes agitated old rivals, is bursting at the seams. In Chandigarh on the eve of the match, I came across someone offering US###1500 for a ticket, whilst a favoured tuk-tuk driver was urgently but forlornly seeking four for his family. Reporters have been instructed to arrive four hours before the first ball - happily it is not a morning start - and the local airport has been forced to find room for 50 private planes. #p#Interest is at fever pitch across the region. India's parliament is shutting up shop at 2.30 pm. A large screen has been erected in the halls of debate. Mumbai's taxi drivers are taking the day off. Companies are asking their employers to arrive at 7am, promising to stop work in time for the first ball. They, too, have put up screens in offices and on factory floors. Otherwise no one would turn up for work. The Melbourne Cup might stop a nation. India versus Pakistan in the World Cup stops a subcontinent. #p#It is a truth often repeated that locals follow not cricket but cricketers. At times that can seem to be the case, but on other occasions it seems unjust, even a little patronising. After all tens of thousands of supporters attended matches played between other nations, and along the way showed every sign of appreciating good cricket. And the same applies in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Keeping ticket prices low gave the common man and humble cricket lover an opportunity to watch the game. And he took it. #p#Now people are paying small fortunes to watch this clash of the neighbours, also described as a confrontation of the titans. Doubtless they are going to watch Sachin Tendulkar and Yuvraj Singh, the reviving local champion. Doubtless they are keen to view the showdown. Is it possible, though, that the supporters might also be capable of appreciating the game itself? #p#As this World Cup has reminded all and sundry once again, cricket can count itself fortunate that it took hold in this region. Certainly trouble comes along with the location, but it is well worth the bother. Vast populations whose interest in the game shows no sign of waning, a rapidly rising middle class, and immense ability have been on display in this tournament. Three of the semi-finalists are from the area and they include the powerful, the impassioned and the original. #p#As far as the semi-final is concerned it has been cast as a battle between India's batting and Pakistan's bowling, and played before a baying crowd, the match ought to be memorable. Having outstared doom against Australia, the Indians may conclude their time has come. Advised by a government minister to avoid match-fixing, the Pakistanis may feel at once affronted and motivated. They, too, have come a long way, further than expected. In that regard they have nothing to lose, or nothing except a nation's foolishly attached pride. #p#India's strength lies in the depth and vigour of their batting. Sachin Tendulkar remains the master of all he surveys, but though the spotlight is still on him the pressure has been spread wider. Virender Sehwag is properly fit again, Virat Kohli looks at home, Suresh Raina will take confidence from his vital innings against Australia, and Mahendra Dhoni knows his mustard. #p#Having outstared doom against Australia, the Indians may conclude their time has come. Advised by a government minister to avoid match-fixing, the Pakistanis may feel at once affronted and motivated #p#Nevertheless Yuvraj Singh is regarded as the most dangerous batsman. Already he has taken three Man-of-the-Match awards in this World Cup. Previously dismissed as a swiper with an inflated reputation, Yuvraj has emerged as a powerful and destructive batsman with a sturdy temperament. Nowadays he keeps the ball on the floor and looks fitter. His bowling has helped because it means he can be certain of his place and knows that whatever happens with the bat, he will contribute to the cause. Allrounders have a lot on their plate but less on their mind. #p#Like all the teams, India has batted without contrivance. Besides showing that 50-over cricket is alive and well, this tournament has also confirmed that cricket does not change all that much, remains a game between bat and ball, and that the laws of physics ought to be respected. The main asset needed by batsmen is the ability to flick the ball pitching on middle and heading towards leg away to the boundary with a neat roll of the wrists. Dilscoops, reverse sweeps, open-chested straight hits and the other innovations have been notable by their absence. They are too unreliable. The basics are back in business. #p#India's weakness is their bowling. One wag on ESPNcricinfo has suggested that India has been devastated by the news that Ashish Nehra and Munaf Patel are fit. A year or two ago India seemed to have a cupboard full of promising pacemen. Now the shelves seem almost empty. It is hard to avoid thinking that premature exposure to the good life takes a toll. Fast bowling demands high levels of focus and fitness. #p#Nehra and Patel have been ineffective, a headache for a team that recognises the importance of the No. 7 position - which has been one of the main developments in the game these last few years - and so opts to field a five-pronged attack, and that's including Yuvraj. However, Zaheer Khan has been superb, especially with the old ball, and Harbhajan is steady and combative. Even so, the Pakistanis will feel they can dominate. #p#Pakistan's main asset is their bowling. Shahid Afridi is the leading wicket-taker in the tournament and Umar Gul has been the best speedster. Afridi career has taken more twists and turns than an Agatha Christie story, but in these twilight years he has found his true calling as a leader, purveyor of tight, flat legbreaks, and lower-order smiter - in which regard his head remains a little hot. #p#Gul has improved enormously in a short period. His work depends on rhythm. His stride is long and unless precise can leave him off balance at delivery. Armed with the new ball, he nowadays approaches the crease purposefully, uses his height, musters a fine pace and swings the ball away from the bat. Later he retains his accuracy but adds a concealed slower ball. In short, he is a handful. If he can take a couple of early wickets the balance of power might shift. #p#Shafiq could hold the key for Pakistan Getty Images Enlarge #p#Pakistan's batting has been steadied by the recall of the two elders, Younis Khan and Misbah-ul-Haq. Not so long ago both were considered surplus to requirements - one of these quirks that seems to crop up more often in Pakistani cricket than in other dispensations. Now they walk out with the air of genial veterans tolerant of the wayward ways of youth and used to sorting out the messes they leave behind. #p#Pakistan's progress will also depend on the form shown by the mercurial Akmal brothers, Umar and Kamran. Both have cheerful round faces, lots of ability and the fearless outlook that makes the entire team dangerous. Afridi, too, can give the ball a wallop and will want to make up for his reckless dismissal in a previous match. Yet Asad Shafiq might hold the key because he brings skill and fortitude to his position at first wicket down. Some colleagues rely on mood and instinct but he sets a higher store by method and a technique tightened in the tape-ball contests in his childhood. #p#Both teams are capably coached and both are captained by characters expressing their contrasting traditions: Dhoni the cool, slightly detached and committed Indian and Afridi his impassioned, volatile and dangerous counterpart. Pakistan has every reason to be proud of its progress, whilst India can likewise be pleased that the pressures of favouritism and hosting the event have not so far told on them. #p#If Pakistan can get going it ought to be a cracker. But the main thing is that it is only a cricket match, a sporting encounter, an exhibition of nerve and skill, a contest at the mercy of the whims. The players will strive with every fibre in their bodies to rise to the occasion. The crowd faces the same challenge. Despite the foreboding, past performance indicates that all parties will bend over backwards to make sure that the meeting is as happy as is possible in a semi-final, an essentially mournful occasion, when much can be lost and nothing won.
48	508574	India v Pakistan, World Cup 2011, 2nd semi-final, Mohali	Only a match in Mohali	Sambit Bal	March 29, 2011	Revelling in victory is the easiest thing, but grace in defeat is easily the highest of virtues Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Features : A visceral leader of men Analysis : Dhoni's unnerving equilibrium Preview : Mercurial outsiders v solid favourites News : Playing the pressure game Features : The joy of cricket Features : The mayhem of an India-Pakistan game Matches: India v Pakistan at Mohali Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: India | Pakistan #p#Fresh from his match-winning performance against Australia in the quarter-final, Yuvraj Singh inevitably found himself confronted with questions about the semi-final against Pakistan. "No point saying it will be a normal match," Yuvraj said. "You all expect us to win, the whole country expects us to win. We are doing the best we can and leaving the rest to God." #p#It's impossible not to feel for the players, all 22 of them. It is no point pretending that this is just another match. It is the semi-final of the World Cup. And it's between India and Pakistan. Between them, there has been Partition. Three wars. Suspicion. Animosity. Kashmir. #p#Also diplomacy. Politics. Attempted reconciliation. Cricket can never expect to fully free itself of the web of history. And though it is a huge and unfair burden that the cricketers carry, it is their reality. #p#But there is another way of looking at India and Pakistan. No two cricket nations have so much in common. There is the language and culture. Food. A shared passion for films and music. So much so that when an Indian or Pakistani lands either in Delhi or Lahore, it feels just like home. And Indian and Pakistani cricketers are friendlier with each other than they are with players from any other country. It's a natural kinship shared among them, perhaps reinforced by empathy. Look at this photograph of Shahid Afridi and MS Dhoni: it's hard to picture any other pair of captains presenting a picture of such warmth and comradeship. #p#I remember a conversation I had with Younis Khan, then captain of Pakistan, a couple of days after his team had beaten India in a Champions Trophy match in Pretoria in 2009. Younis spoke of chiding a couple of Indian television journalists who'd been chasing him for a quote that would damn Dhoni. "Why are you after Dhoni?" he asked them. "Winning and losing, it keeps happening. Today it is his turn, tomorrow it could be mine." #p#Younis wasn't being prescient, just real. A couple of days later he found himself before the firing squad, answering questions about match-fixing after having dropped a simple catch off Grant Elliot in the semi-final against New Zealand. Elliot went on to play a match-winning innings. Younis was playing with a broken finger. "A few days ago I took a catch and effected a run-out and I was praised for playing with a broken finger," he said. Some questioned his wisdom of playing with an injury, but had he pulled out, he would surely been accused of abdicating his responsibility to the country. #p#Sport is inextricably linked to national identity. Which isn't a bad thing by itself, because sport for the most part is a feel-good, positive force. It makes fans appreciate skills and beauty, the thrill of competition and of overcoming odds. But being a sports fan is as much about joy as it is about pain. It's part of the deal. For every winner there must be a loser. In fact, victory would never feel so thrilling without the experience of loss. #p#India v Pakistan will be a test for the fans as well as the players AFP Enlarge #p#All sports, wrote Simon Barnes in The Meaning of Sport , "represent the collision of wills: people or teams who want the same thing and have to cause somebody pain in order to get it" It is easy, if you so choose, to find in this a metaphor for warfare, but the beauty of sport is that people rarely die playing it. Sportsmen compete fiercely and proudly, exhausting themselves mentally and physically in the pursuit of victory, and then the victor and vanquished walk off the field, shaking each other's hand, and often with the knowledge that no victory or loss is final. They will compete again tomorrow and there will be another shot at redemption. That is the essence of sport. #p#Partisanship is fundamental to fandom. It is the bedrock of sport. Without it sport would be reduced to a mere spectacle, devoid of its emotional core. By the same token, triumphalism is its biggest bane. Allied with nationalism, it presents the ugly face of sport. It blinds fans to the very spirit of competition between athletes. #p#Twenty-two cricketers will subject their skills and temperament to the toughest of tests tomorrow. Equally, the fans in both the nations will be on trial too. #p#Very few expected Pakistan to go so far so smoothly in this World Cup. Only a month ago their team lay in tatters following the spot-fixing verdict. Irrespective of what happens in Mohali, their performance in the World Cup is worthy of celebration. Indian fans never forget to remind the world that their team has not lost to Pakistan in a World Cup match. That is an impressive record. But it's not a run that can last forever. Nothing in life is permanent. #p#Fans should feel grateful the tournament has produced a semi-final that feels like a final. It is also appropriate that the match is taking place in Punjab. Mohali is a small town, lacking the facilities and space for such a high-profile match, but there couldn't have been a more perfect place, geographically and culturally, for a World Cup match between these two rivals. #p#Punjabiyat is the biggest common theme between these nations, and the spirit of hospitality is the defining characteristic of the Punjabi culture on both sides of the border. It has become a cliché now, but travelling to Pakistan during India's landmark tour of 2004 provided me with some of the most moving and uplifting experiences of my life. It was, and will remain, one of the greatest examples of how sport - and in the subcontinent that means cricket - can be a beacon for goodwill and fellow feeling. #p#And after the fans have spent themselves in cheering their teams, irrespective of the result, they will do well to evoke the spirit of Chennai in 1999 or Karachi in 2004. After their teams had lost emotionally draining encounters, the fans rose to make their sport, and nations, proud. #p#On the field tomorrow there is the opportunity for one team to take the penultimate step towards cricket's biggest prize. For Pakistan, for all its troubles inside and outside the game, a World Cup win will be the tonic that the nation needs. For Indians, above everything else, it will be the perfect gift for their most-adored sport hero. But a bigger opportunity lies beyond the boundary. To revel in victory is the greatest reward for the sports fan, but nothing dignifies the sport more than grace in defeat.
48	508592	India v Pakistan, World Cup 2011, 2nd semi-final, Mohali	A visceral leader of men	Osman Samiuddin in Mohali	March 29, 2011	The success of any Pakistan captain lies basically in his own individual success, and Shahid Afridi has had that in this World Cup AFP Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: Shahid Afridi Matches: India v Pakistan at Mohali Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Pakistan #p#Until two weeks before this World Cup began, it mustn't be forgotten, Shahid Afridi wasn't even captain of Pakistan. Misbah-ul-Haq was a strong contender and a number of players were said to be unhappy with Afridi's gift - and curse - for public straight-talk, particularly when criticising players. #p#Yet, in four days time, he may well be a World Cup winning captain. He continues to be appointed on a series-by-series basis and he must be the only captain in the world who doesn't complain about that unstable arrangement. Every game, he insists after all, he plays as if his first or last. He thrives on it. #p#So now he leads his team into a World Cup semi-final, precisely as he said he would before the tournament began. It's India, so it will be among the biggest games he has played, and for many of his younger players, a game that can make a career. Ian Chappell has criticised him, but really? Afridi, as captain, taking Pakistan this far? If you'd said it two years ago, you would have been committed. #p#The success of any Pakistan captain lies basically in his own individual success. Players respond naturally to the man who does well, because they think that makes him strong, the man who can get stuff done, the man who can make 'em or break 'em. Afridi has done it by becoming arguably the most important player in the side and its very personification. Few would have expected him to be the leading wicket-taker at this tournament so far but here he is, having bowled vital, wicket-taking spells throughout. Take him out and the nature, to say nothing of the threat, of the side is greatly diminished. #p#Without ball in hand, on the field, he has led by energy, keeping his players alert and on edge. Occasionally he has shown tactical awareness. No Pakistani captain had opened with spin, for example, until he did so with Abdur Rehman against New Zealand. Against West Indies, he picked Saeed Ajmal to combat their left-hand batsmen but opened with Mohammad Hafeez, whose spell set up the game. He has brought back his strike fast bowlers at the right time, early when needed. #p#Behind him, Waqar Younis has provided a very organic assistance. They haven't used any gizmos, there is no nutrition expert or fitness guru or mental conditioner. They've just made the players work damned hard in practice and allowed them to play a game of bat and ball on the field. #p#Probably the two smartest things Afridi has done have been away from the play. One, he has taken on board a clutch of senior players in the side, men such as Younis Khan, Misbah-ul-Haq, Abdul Razzaq and Umar Gul. He has mostly just let them be, trusting their experience, but involving them as well on the field and in training, where Younis and Misbah have been particularly influential. #p#And in the public eye he has backed each and every one of his players, making some tough calls. Players from the periphery, like Razzaq, to the under-fire, like Kamran Akmal (apart from a brief period of wobble in the immediate aftermath of New Zealand) to the out-of-form, like Ahmed Shehzad and Mohammad Hafeez, have been persevered with. He has backed them in the name of stability, in the name of a winning combination. Not all has made sense, but togetherness has been built, hardly a murmur from the dressing room. #p#"Some things I do very emotionally in team meetings, to get the boys fired up and they do get fired up because of that," he said ahead of the semi-final in Mohali. "We are an emotional people, both countries. I don't think that the unity of the team, or where we have reached, it is not down to me. I don't want to take credit for that. When the team does well, 15 out of 15 do well and that is when you get a proper unit. All the credit I will give to the 15 guys, the seniors, our management, our coaches, they have made all the effort." #p#It was a good appearance ahead of the game, full of humour, bonhomie, wisecracks and digs; Afridi in a good, relaxed mood, comfortable as captain of Pakistan. To follow him through Sri Lanka and Dhaka has been to humanise him, an expressive man given to moods, but a naturally charismatic presence in any gathering. Over the last month and more, he has also been surprisingly focused, surprising given his generally short attention spans. #p#But in every sense, come what may on Wednesday, Afridi has been a true leader of men, with them on bad days and good days, taking them ultimately to a place few expected them to reach.
48	508618	India v Pakistan, 2nd semi-final, World Cup 2011, Mohali	The mayhem of an India-Pakistan game	Sharda Ugra in Mohali	March 29, 2011	Nothing stirs up passions like a clash between the two arch-rivals Associated Press Enlarge Related Links Analysis : Dhoni's unnerving equilibrium Preview : Mercurial outsiders v solid favourites Sambit Bal : Only a match in Mohali Features : The joy of cricket Audio/Video: Misbah-ul-Haq: Afridi has led by example Matches: India v Pakistan at Mohali Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Pakistan #p#There was thunder and lightning in Mohali. The night before a game of cricket, the clouds were rumbling, the winds were howling and the skies were streaked with flashes of heated silver. The advent of summer in this part of the Punjab isn't usually marked by loud messages from the Himalayas like these. It is not hard to imagine why it was different on Tuesday night. The subcontinent's fractious, umbilically-bound neighbours have opened their windows and let in a World Cup semi-final. #p#India and Pakistan co-exist in general grumpiness, rubbing shoulders like two men diving into a phone booth at the same time or jostling for elbow room when sitting next to each other in a darkened cinema. #p#India versus Pakistan is a bit different. #p#When that happens, the cricket suddenly morphs into a new life form. On the day of every match, for countrymen on either side, along with thirteen cricketers, history, culture, war, and geopolitics also walk out to the middle. It is a completely unfair notion, particularly for the teams involved. But the idea has stoked a rivalry for over six decades and ensures that reality and reason leave the stadium and millions of living rooms at the same time. India versus Pakistan brings the two nations to a standstill and - and this should come as a public advisory below the live feed of every India v Pakistan match - makes television executives go ga-ga. #p#When India versus Pakistan happens in the World Cup semi-final on Wednesday it is two teams of players who will be required to be the sober professionals because most of the subcontinent will by then have been drugged by jingoism and chauvinism. Once the handshaking is done, the teams must forget that their two prime ministers are watching them from the stands and have only decided to start talking after several years it would seem because this match turned up. #p#All of that that must somehow be rendered unimportant - because when the two nations play, the abnormality of all around them is what is normal. In this scenario, both the Indian and Pakistani cricketers are well-trained. This extreme is their everyday. #p#India have spent the World Cup living in their bullet-proof bubble so far, progressing at an unhurried pace which can be seem unnerving to watch. Yet, after a straggly start, it was only in their last match, after seven attempts, that India went from being the Cup's slightly underdone hosts to genuine contenders. #p#In Ahmedabad, they lost the toss, fielded in the heat with a standard that suddenly went from grandfatherly to athletic middle age, before chasing against three-time world champions Australia and showing their steel. #p#In Mohali, they have to be sharp and shiny, too because between the two teams, it is India's margins that are far more narrow. To not progress to the final of a World Cup where everything has been laid out to take them to the trophy would be seen as a crushing let down by MS Dhoni's men. The scale of this match against Pakistan can only be understood by two things: the security personnel involved, who teem through Mohali in scores, and the fact that the semi-final has even diminished the attention around Sachin Tendulkar's 100 international 100s. The man appears to have streaked his hair in what looks like red. When he first arrived on the ground in Mohali on Sunday he began knocking with a set of new bats and shouted across to his mates who had begun their football, "Call me if your are in trouble, I will be there." Against Pakistan, India will want Tendulkar around, minus trouble. #p#In the midst of the mayhem, if there is one constant at work for the Indians during this World Cup - which Zaheer Khan described the day before the game - it is its "nice and calm dressing room" India's has been a slow journey in the tournament, as if the gas in the tank was far too low and could only be used sparingly. It all goes well until Pakistan turns up because trying to cling to ideas of calm at that point is like trying to meditate in an Aerosmith concert. It is not impossible but requires very high skill to achieve. If slow turn at most of the other venues - and Yuvraj Singh - is what has helped them against other teams so far, in Mohali, India will want the sheer weight of runs to wear out the Pakistan bowlers. #p#Pakistan are happy to embrace whatever is being thrown at them. Be it questions about the spot-fixing crisis, the statements from their Interior Minister talking about tapping their phones, the entire Shoaib Akhtar drama or people back home demanding victories. If Shahid Afridi's media conference is to be believed, getting to the World Cup semi-final and being in Mohali, represents everything: team unity, Indo-Pak relations, the overall Pakistani strike-rate with the bat, issues of the average age of his team and future relations and cricket itineraries between the two nations. #p#India are playing a most un-Indian percentage game and Pakistan are Pakistan and now playing without fear. The size of the ground, the pace off the wicket and the enormity of the occasion may force teams to even throw the last dice of their World Cup in here on Wednesday. So it could be Shoaib Akhtar turning up for one last tilt at Tendulkar. And Yusuf Pathan turning up to match Afridi and Razzak, brutish blow for brutish blow. #p#In a match of this magnitude, India will be secure in the knowledge, like Yuvraj said after the quarter-final, that they know how to handle high pressure situations during difficult passages of play. Afridi's "emotional" captaincy has brought Pakistan this far, yet in a this game, where emotions have boiled over before a ball has been bowled, it is the lack of it that may just work better. Reason and reality may have left the stadium and both their countries, but the men that can hang on to it on the field will take their team to the World Cup final. #p#In the midst of all this, there will be talks between prime ministers, paperwork between bureaucrats and dinners of vital importance laid out in stadium dining halls with many backs no doubt turned away from the cricket. #p#Given the importance both governments have placed on this single cricket match, perhaps an equal regard should be extended to those involved in it. Maybe Afridi and Dhoni's crisis management capabilities should be recognised by inviting them sit in during one of those Indo-Pak 'summit meetings.' Between them, the captains of India and Pakistan can cover the entire spectrum of responses that work in conflict resolution. Or at the very least they certainly know how to deal with a larger audience outside that just wants a result.
48	508668	India v Pakistan, 2nd semi-final, World Cup 2011, Mohali	News channels granted semi-final access	ESPNcricinfo staff	March 30, 2011	#p#News channels will be allowed access to the Mohali stadium for the India-Pakistan semi-final after India's information and broadcasting minister Ambika Soni intervened on their behalf. The ICC had withdrawn accreditation for Indian news channels on Tuesday after "a dispute was created by Indian non-rights holders (NRH) breaching the terms and conditions they had agreed to follow" when they were awarded accreditation for the World Cup. #p#The ICC said Soni had proposed a 24-hour 'truce'. "Ms Soni had written to ICC President Sharad Pawar and asked for the television channels to be allowed access into the ground at Mohali for this important game," ICC chief Haroon Lorgat said. "At the same time she agreed to convene a meeting at the ministry on March 31, to address the dispute which has been caused by repeated and serious breaches of the terms and conditions which these organisations had signed up to." #p#The guidelines for covering the World Cup were issued to news broadcasters in January by the ICC. "No objections to the guidelines were received and accreditations were issued to reporters and cameramen on condition that these guidelines were followed," Lorgat said. "Sadly there have been many breaches and despite requests for such activity to cease the NRH stations continued to break the rules. #p#"It was only as a last resort that the ICC withdrew the accreditation of these companies when they refused to sign an undertaking that they would desist from breaching the guidelines." Lorgat reminded the press that removal of accreditation only meant that the news channels did not have access to the stadium. "It does not prevent these channels from reporting the ICC Cricket World Cup. Footage is provided to them from several agencies." #p#If the relevant media houses do not comply with the ICC's requirements, Lorgat said, accreditation would once again be withdrawn for the final.

Despite the customary speculation surrounding his participation before each game ever since he announced his international retirement (before the group game against Australia), Pakistan chose an unchanged line-up from the quarter-final win against West Indies in Dhaka. That means Wahab Riaz retains his place. #p#The question of Shoaib's inclusion was the subject of considerable discussion within the team management in the build-up to the game. Essentially it came down to Shoaib's fitness to last an entire innings - and multiple spells - but his big-game experience weighed up against Riaz's freshness and inexperience, but importantly, the variation he provides as a left-arm paceman. On Tuesday evening, they opted for the latter. The team were also keen to stick as much as possible with the same XI throughout the tournament. #p#The issue was confused by comments made by Afridi in the pre-match press conference, in which he said, "Shoaib is not 100% but he is trying his level best. We will decide this evening." That was widely interpreted to mean that he was carrying an injury or wasn't fit enough to play this game, but it is the line that Pakistan have trotted out throughout the tournament and it relates to his general fitness levels, rather than a specific injury. #p#Both Afridi and coach Waqar Younis have talked repeatedly of Shoaib not being at optimum fitness levels, though he has still played three group games, picking up three wickets. Their concerns grew after he struggled to bowl his last over against New Zealand, the 47th of the innings, which ultimately went for 28 runs. #p#Until that over, however, he had bowled well without much luck, knocking over Brendan McCullum in his first over before seeing centurion Ross Taylor missed twice in three balls in his second spell. He hasn't played a game since. Earlier in the tournament, incidentally, when asked about his fitness, Shoaib said that he had played much of his career not entirely fit. #p#Sources within the team management admitted the decision to exclude Shoaib had upset him considerably. He believes he is fit enough to play and that his experience of big games should have seen him in the line-up. He bowled in the pre-match warm-ups and looked to be running in as he has through the last year. #p#The occasion of the match, and missing out on it, will also have upset him. Shoaib has always enjoyed the rivalry with India, from his Eden Gardens introduction in 1998-99 even through the World Cup Centurion game and he remains one of the most popular Pakistani cricketers in India.

Saturday's decider will now be a battle of the hosts, and while Sri Lanka might have been surprised by the strength of India's bowling effort, they would also have taken note of a slightly lacklustre batting performance. #p#In the end, India's 260 for 9 was enough as their bowlers did a fine job, but had Pakistan helped themselves, the target could have been so much more gettable. Sachin Tendulkar was dropped four times in his 85, MS Dhoni was put down once and while Wahab Riaz was extremely impressive in collecting five wickets, Umar Gul had one of his most forgettable days, wilting under the pressure of a World Cup semi-final. #p#By contrast, India's display in the field was much more professional, and that was the difference in a match that lived up to the extreme pre-match hype. The decision to leave R Ashwin out to make room for Ashish Nehra was an odd choice on a pitch offering plenty of spin, but Nehra and his bowling colleagues built the pressure and gave Pakistan's batsmen little to attack after they made a promising start and reached 70 for 1. #p#The Indians didn't give away an extra until the 37th over of the innings, and the way they put together strings of dot balls and tight overs was key to their success. Munaf Patel picked up two victims and Yuvraj Singh made up for his golden duck with a pair of wickets, but the most important breakthrough came when Harbhajan Singh bowled Umar Akmal for 29. #p#Akmal had struck a pair of sixes off Yuvraj, driving him over the sight screen and pulling him over midwicket, and anything was possible while he was at the crease. But Dhoni called on Harbhajan to replace Yuvraj, and with the first ball of his spell he came around the wicket and pushed one across Akmal, taking the off stump when the batsman played for the spin. #p#Shahid Afridi also fell to Harbhajan when he skied a catch off a full toss, and the obdurate Misbah-ul-Haq was left to steer the chase. He found it difficult to lift his tempo and was the last man out, caught on the boundary for 56 in the final over, but he ate up 76 deliveries and had he shown some more intent earlier, Pakistan might have had a chance. #p#It was a disappointing end for Pakistan after their top order gave them hope. Mohammad Hafeez made an encouraging 43 before a string of eight dot balls from Munaf brought a brain-fade as Hafeez tried a premeditated paddle sweep from outside off stump and edged behind to Dhoni. #p#Soon after, the loss of Asad Shafiq brought the Mohali crowd to life, when he tried to cut a Yuvraj delivery that was much too full and straight, and the middle stump was knocked back. Shafiq had made 30 and had displayed a cool temperament until that point, but the required run-rate started to balloon, and Pakistan never recovered. #p#But while India have booked a place in the final, they must hope they haven't used all their good fortune too soon. Tendulkar might be the finest batsman of his generation, but today he was the luckiest, dropped on 27, 45, 70 and 81. It seemed as though he was going to bring up his 100th international century with one of his least convincing innings. #p#Misbah at midwicket was the first to put him down, before Younis Khan spilled a regulation chance at cover, both off the bowling of Afridi. The third opportunity came when Kamran Akmal didn't move his hands quickly enough to a thick edge, again off Afridi, and while that was a tough opportunity, a pull to Umar at mid-on from the offspin of Hafeez should have been taken. #p#Before he had any of those lives, Tendulkar had survived two very tight calls on 23: an lbw decision that was given out by Ian Gould but on review proved to be spinning down leg, and a near-stumping the next delivery when he just got his back foot down in time after losing his balance reaching outside off. When Tendulkar was finally taken at cover by Afridi off the bowling of Ajmal, Pakistan's relief was evident. #p#Soon after, a scratchy Dhoni, who was also dropped by Kamran, made the mistake of challenging Simon Taufel on an lbw decision. Dhoni had 25 when he missed a Riaz delivery that pitched just in line and was hitting the stumps. It was the second outstanding call by Taufel, who had given Virender Sehwag lbw in a similar fashion earlier, even though the left-armer's angle meant pitching outside leg was a possibility. #p#Riaz was the man who Afridi had to thank for keeping Pakistan in the contest after India made a strong start and reached 114 for 1 off their first 18 overs. After Gautam Gambhir was stumped wandering down the pitch against Hafeez, Riaz grabbed two wickets in two balls - Virat Kohli caught at backward point and Yuvraj bowled by a low full toss for a golden duck. #p#Nobody looked as fluent as the crease as Sehwag, who took 21 off Gul (0 for 69) from the third over of the innings. What looked like a 300-plus total in those early overs became 260 when Suresh Raina helped them recover from their middle-order failures. #p#It was enough, but India's batsmen will need to improve if they want to lift the trophy on Saturday. For now, they can dream of their first World Cup in 28 years. #p#Match Timeline
48	508753	India v Pakistan, World Cup 2011, semi-final, Mohali	Fielding clangers and Wahab's big day	Osman Samiuddin and Sharda Ugra at the PCA Stadium	March 30, 2011	That's how you do it: Shahid Afridi celebrates Sachin Tendulkar's dismissal... eventually Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Analysis : Pakistan let it slip through their fingers, literally Matches: India v Pakistan at Mohali Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: India | Pakistan #p#The Moment of Truth The DRS may actually work. Well, only the Indians were not yet fully convinced. Until, the ICC hopes, today. In Saeed Ajmal's second over, he had Sachin Tendulkar plumb - and the umpire thought so - or what looked like plumb first shot as well as in the replay. Tendulkar, though, was far from convinced. He walked over to his partner Gautam Gambhir and after a brief discussion asked for a review. The dead surety of Tendulkar's refusal, everyone thought, could only be due to an inside edge. Not quite. But Tendulkar asking for the review seemed almost prescient: the replay predictive path showed the ball going over and well past the leg stump. #p#The Epidemic After being quoted as saying that he would not allow Tendulkar to score his 100th international century, Shahid Afridi and friends then did their best to guide him in that direction. It took an epidemic of clangers to make Tendulkar's 85 happen. Three times off Afridi's bowling Tendulkar was dropped - by Misbah-ul-Haq at midwicket (on 27), Younis Khan at extra cover (on 45) and Kamran Akmal (70) failing to hang on to a thin, quick snick. A fourth chance with Tendulkar on 81 was spilt off Mohammed Hafeez's bowling. Finally, Afridi decided to show his underlings how catches needed to be seized. Given that the ball had come straight at him and he'd actually hung on, Boom Boom was allowed to do a bit of celebrating. But before everyone was able to forget about the dropped catches, Kamran let an edge from Dhoni get past him. #p#The assault Umar Gul against Virender Sehwag was always going to be one of the mini-battles of the game: one of the tournament's leading fast bowlers against the leading slayer of Pakistani fast bowling. Sehwag ended it as early as the third over of the innings, Gul's second. The first two balls were too straight and full, duly dispatched to the leg-side boundary. Fields were changed, slips came out but to no avail: Sehwag casually picked off three more boundaries in a 21-run over and Gul never recovered. #p#The Shoaibi It was always going to be a tough call in such a big game: Wahab Riaz or Shoaib Akhtar? Pakistan opted for the former and it paid off spectacularly as Riaz ended with a maiden five-wicket haul. The pick of the wickets was the dipping, swerving full toss to dismiss Yuvraj Singh first ball, a delivery, in fact, Shoaib himself would've been proud of. It led to a pumped-up airplane celebration, made famous by   none other than Shoaib of course. #p#The shot Pakistan were well set at 70 for 1, Mohammad Hafeez was better set on 43. He'd hit some fine drives, cut well, pulled authoritatively once. It looked one of the match's prettier knocks. Munaf Patel then pitched one well outside off, on a length, and Hafeez decided the best option was not to leave it, or drive it, but to try and somehow paddle it over his left shoulder. Instead it took an edge to be safely pouched by MS Dhoni. It was the Hafeez moment, the one which occurs in almost every innings he plays, and the template on which his ODI career is based (his average is just over 23).
48	508787	India v Pakistan, World Cup 2011, semi-final, Mohali	The crucial first 15 overs, and mysterious Misbah	S Rajesh	March 30, 2011	#p#As it turned out, almost all the experts read the wicket wrong. MS Dhoni and Sachin Tendulkar admitted as much in the post-match presentation, and from the scores it's obvious that run-making was a lot more difficult on this Mohali pitch than it was expected to be. The team composition and the early overs suggested a score of around 300 would be a par total, but later events showed it was another subcontinent track on which run-scoring against the hard new ball was much easier. #p#In that context, the difference between the two teams was the runs they scored in the first 15 overs, when the ball was new. Pakistan's top three played useful cameos too, but none of them exploded in the manner that Virender Sehwag had. Sehwag's 25-ball 38 allowed India to rack up 99 in the first 15 overs, compared to Pakistan's 70. The difference of 29 was exactly the margin by which Pakistan lost the match, which means in the remaining 35 overs, the two teams scored exactly the same number of runs. Of course, the approaches of the two teams at the start were obviously different since Pakistan knew the target in front of them, but Pakistan struggled as much as India did in the middle overs. What made their case worse was the fact that they got no reciprocal help from the Indian fielders, or from the dew which was expected to set in later in the evening. #p#How the Indian and Pakistan innings shaped up Team - overs Score Dots 1s/ 2s 4s/ 6s India - 1 to 15 99 for 1 52 18/ 2 16/ 0 Pakistan - 1 to 15 70 for 1 57 19/ 2 11/ 0 India - 16 to 40 101 for 4 85 50/ 6 8/ 0 Pakistan - 16 to 40 107 for 5 79 53/ 12 4/ 2 India - 41 to 50 60 for 4 29 21/ 4 6/ 0 Pakistan - 41 to 50 54 for 4 33 20/ 1 5/ 1 #p#Misbah's mystery innings Misbah-ul-Haq's strike rate at the end of his innings was 73.68; Tendulkar's rate for his 85 was 73.91. That, perhaps, is as good an example as any to illustrate the fact that stats without context is meaningless. Misbah's inexplicable go-slow through the first half of his innings resulted in the asking rate climbing to unmanageable proportions, and it also forced the other batsmen to take risks that might otherwise have been unnecessary. He tried to make up for it later, but apart from helping him reach a personal landmark and improving his strike-rate, his late hits counted for little. #p#Overall, Misbah played out 42 dot balls, which was the most among Pakistan's batsmen. In his first 42 balls, he scored only 17 and played 27 dots. During this period, Pakistan's asking rate went up from 6.07 to 8.45. Younis Khan's sluggish innings didn't help either - add his 13 from 32 balls to Misbah's 17 in his first 42, and Pakistan have every reason to feel their two most experienced batsmen didn't serve them well: in those 74 balls, the two batsmen got a grand total of 30 runs, with no boundaries. Even with the power-hitters to follow, that was a bridge too far. #p#Misbah's mis-paced innings Runs Dots 1s/ 2s 4s/ 6s First 42 balls 17 27 13/ 2 0/ 0 Last 34 balls 39 15 13/ 0 5/ 1 Full innings (76 balls) 56 42 26/ 0 5/ 1 #p#A spell to remember The batsmen's poor effort ensured that a wonderful bowling performance by Wahab Riaz went in vain. He became only the second bowler, after Venkatesh Prasad, to take a five-for in an India-Pakistan World Cup match. He joins eight other Pakistan bowlers to have taken a five-for in an ODI against India. #p#More stats This is India's first World Cup semi-final win at home in three attempts. They'd lost to England in 1987, and to Sri Lanka in 1996. However, they've won both their World Cup semi-final matches away from home (in 1983 and 2003). #p#Tendulkar has won nine Man-of-the-Match awards in World Cups, which is easily the highest. Three of those have been against Pakistan: he'd also won the prize against them in 1992 and in 2003. #p#Sehwag and Dhoni joined five other Indian batsmen to score 1000 ODI runs against Pakistan. Tendulkar leads with 2474 runs at an average of 39.90. #p#It was only the second time in his ODI career that Yuvraj Singh was dismissed for a golden duck - the first instance was against Kenya nearly ten years ago.
48	508795	India v Pakistan, World Cup 2011, semi-final, Mohali	Shahid Afridi proud of Pakistan's performance	Osman Samiuddin at the PCA Stadium	March 30, 2011	#p#Shahid Afridi pronounced himself "proud" of his team's performance in the World Cup and hoped that their reception on arrival in Pakistan would reflect the side's achievement in getting to the last four at a time when expectations were significantly lower. #p#Pakistan lost by 29 runs to India in Mohali in a scrappy match, in which they were generally off their game with bat, ball and, most damagingly, in the field. They were in with a chance at various stages, including when they began the chase, only to let it slip each time. #p#Afridi said the batting, their weaker suit, had been problematic again. There were several starts but no stand greater than the opening one of 44. "We were struggling to build partnerships right through the tournament," he said. "The matches where we had partnerships we made good scores. Because we couldn't make partnerships, today we struggled and played some bad shots at the wrong time as well." #p#But their run-in to the game, with only one loss in seven matches, came after another period of turmoil which saw them lose three key players in last year's spot-fixing scandal, including a dangerous new-ball opening pair in Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Amir. To add to the instability, Afridi wasn't appointed captain until two weeks before the tournament began but an unheralded Pakistan side beat Sri Lanka, Australia and West Indies en route to the semi-final. #p#Afridi had said before the tournament he wanted his team in the last four and despite the loss, seemed in generally upbeat mood. "I am proud of my team and the boys have done a great job in this World Cup. A few of the youngsters are very promising and we played as a unit. Winning and losing is something different but we really played really good cricket and no one was expecting us to play cricket like this. As captain I'm very happy." #p#Shahid Afridi: "To build this team and the effort we put in was phenomenal." Getty Images Enlarge #p#The run was Pakistan's best in a World Cup since 1999, when they were runners-up to Australia. In 2003 and 2007 they were eliminated before the knock-out stages, disastrous results which led to intense anger and criticism on their return. It is unlikely Afridi's side will receive a similar reception though already the early signs of reaction from Pakistan seemed to focus on Misbah-ul-Haq's slow batting in the chase as the cause of defeat. #p#"We have played better than those sides [of 2003 and 2007] and they were good sides," Afridi said. "We didn't have much hope from this side but I have respect for my team. Reception? We will go back, people will give us confidence, they backed us. If those people who make us stars say a little what's wrong with that? It's nothing big. Nobody wanted Pakistan to lose, we wanted to win, but people I think realize we gave it our all. To win six games from eight is a big achievement." #p#A few incidents apart, Pakistan went through the tournament without any major scandal and a visible sense of unity and togetherness within the squad. That in itself was a minor triumph given what had gone before. "The difficult circumstances we played cricket in, the difficult circumstances we have gone through in the last nine-ten months, to build this team and the effort we put in was phenomenal. #p#"I'd like to thank the PCB chairman for giving me support and the way the boys supported each other and me, the management and the coach, they really helped me a lot. To take a broken team, make it into a team for the World Cup and to perform like no one was expecting, I'm happy with that."
48	508797	India v Pakistan, 2nd semi-final, World Cup 2011, Mohali	India well prepared for pressure games - Dhoni	Sharda Ugra at the PCA Stadium	March 30, 2011	#p#One of the most important benefits from India's scrappy World Cup semi-final victory over Pakistan - apart from the sound and sight of a hundred firecrackers going out around the PCA stadium on a Mohali night and the adoration of millions - is their team's sense of being in what captain MS Dhoni equated to a good spell. #p#Dhoni said the format of the World Cup had helped the Indians get to a stage just before the final where off-field distractions and on-field pressures could both be handled. "The format really helped us. We have had quite a few close games where we were tested. Some of the youngsters were tested. They were at the crease at a time when a big performance was needed from them. Slowly they are getting into the groove." #p#Dhoni said India's performances in the knockouts had given the team a greater sense of comfort going into the final, with regard to the pressures of the event. He compared the last week of the World Cup to a bowler bowling at more than 150kph. "Once you do that you don't think whether you are bowling 155 or 160. So I think after the semis, the final won't feel much different. The feeling (of the importance of a game) has been static for a while and hopefully that will really help us." #p#In the semi-final, Dhoni said the Indians had read the wicket incorrectly in deciding to opt for a 3-1 attack, replacing offspinner R Ashwin with left-arm seamer Ashish Nehra. It was driven, he said, by India's part-time options as well as Pakistani batsmen generally being at ease against spin. "We can manoeuvre with the part-timers. We thought on a normal Mohali pitch, you don't see assistance to spinners. The ball doesn't turn big time. Here the ball was stopping. #p#India have developed a familiarity with that winning feeling in two knockout games this World Cup Getty Images Enlarge #p#"I felt it was better to go with safer option, but we went with a safe option and misread the wicket." #p#The Indians, Dhoni said, had paced their innings against Pakistan well, particularly when compared to how they had handled the World Cup's middle and end overs prior to this game. The track, he said, became slower at the halfway stage, and with the Pakistanis bowling tight and India losing Virat Kohli and Yuvraj Singh off consecutive deliveries, it had become difficult to rotate the strike. "Their spinners bowled really well, even Mohammad Hafeez was able to capitalise." The innings calculation had then been tempered down. "After losing two wickets in the middle overs it is important to bat 50 overs in big games, you shouldn't look to score 300-320. If the wicket is behaving in a different way, re-adjust your target." #p#Dhoni said he had thought India's total of 260 was "a good score not a safe score" and India's immediate target had been to "not give away runs with the new ball." #p#All that Dhoni was willing to comment on about the first-ever all-Asian World Cup final to be held on April 2 was to praise the Sri Lankans for their progress through the tournament. India he said, "have also really been tested more often than not and it will be a really good game. It's not about what your rating is but how good you are on the day. You have to be at your best."
48	508808	India v Pakistan, 2nd semi-final, World Cup 2011, Mohali	Pakistan let it slip through their fingers, literally	Osman Samiuddin at the PCA Stadium	March 30, 2011	Younis Khan's drop was one of four reprieves handed to Sachin Tendulkar AFP Enlarge Related Links Features : Fielding clangers and Wahab's big day Players/Officials: Kamran Akmal | Misbah-ul-Haq | Sachin Tendulkar | Umar Akmal | Younis Khan Matches: India v Pakistan at Mohali Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: India | Pakistan #p#At some point over the next couple of days, Pakistan will come to understand just how close they actually got - with this side whom few gave a chance - to getting to a World Cup final. The margin of defeat looks comfortable enough but there wasn't a whole lot between them and India, ultimately, other than a safe pair of hands somewhere, anywhere in the field. #p#There are many frustrating ways to lose a game, let alone one as big as this, but few gnaw away at reason and rationality quite like those lost to dropped catches. In this age of the instant vent and search for a "match ka mujrim" (criminal of the match), Misbah-ul-Haq's innings is already being pilloried in Pakistan for its poor pacing. The reaction is misplaced and overdone, for the pitch wasn't given to fluent strokeplay, particularly after the ball softened, and there had already been some momentum-losing poor shots earlier from the openers. #p#Blaming the batting in any case misses the point. Pakistan are never comfortable chasers and 261, in a World Cup semi-final, at the home of the opposition is an entirely different kind of 261 from the ones they might chase down in a bilateral series in the UAE. The point is, they shouldn't have been chasing that much in the first place. #p#There are some truisms in cricket that Pakistan quite brazenly and joyously ignore; leading among them are those to do with catching. They win matches? Yes, but not as much as scoring runs and taking wickets, thank you. They once dropped Graeme Smith five times as he ground out 65 in an ODI in Lahore, and still won the match comfortably. They dropped seven catches in an innings in New Zealand in 2009-10 and won the Test comfortably. These are to recall just two examples from a sizeable sample. #p#But there are some rules in life you cannot defy, some batsmen you really cannot give a chance to. And if you give Sachin Tendulkar four chances - not one but four! Tendulkar! - you cannot expect to win a game, no matter what else you do. It was one of Tendulkar's least fluent recent innings as well, but in the drops of Misbah, Younis Khan - their two best catchers -Kamran Akmal and Umar Akmal, went the game. It is as simple as that. #p#It wasn't - as it never is - just the runs that came after the drops, though Tendulkar did add 58 runs after the first chance went down. It was the mood that was lost each time. The first spill, with Tendulkar on 27, came as Pakistan were beginning to regain their senses after Virender Sehwag's early blast. Tendulkar had just survived two torrid overs from Saeed Ajmal and a seminal moment was at hand. #p#The second, on 45, came the over after Gautam Gambhir had gone. Momentum again was at stake. The third came a few overs after Wahab Riaz's two-wicket over left India in a position of real danger. All chances, incidentally, were created by the tournament's leading wicket-taker, the man to whom Pakistan look for inspiration, for breakthroughs, for controlling the middle overs of the game, their captain, a man who thrives on taking precisely such wickets, Shahid Afridi. #p#The effects of this on a game cannot possibly be calculated, except to say the obvious, that it changes everything and goes beyond runs alone. Who knows what target Pakistan could have been chasing? There was another, less important, miss later, on 81, but a miss nonetheless and none of the outfield catches were difficult. #p#"We made some big mistakes in fielding, we dropped some catches, and catches for Sachin," Afridi said. He then quipped, referring to his much-discussed phantom statement in the build-up of trying to prevent a 100th international Tendulkar hundred, "I told you he wouldn't score a hundred." It was gallows humour. #p#It is sad - but also predictable - that ultimately it came down to Pakistan's fielding, for that is the one area they have really worked hard on in training and actually thought about methodically, making sure for once of placing the right fielders in the right places. Younger players have come in who genuinely enjoy fielding, a couple of older ones have led the way. #p#They have been very sharp as they were against Australia but also still capable of sudden, unexpected tragi-comedy as against Sri Lanka at the R Premadasa in the second half of the hosts' chase and today. Overall, they have been considerably better than before, in particular with the energy they have brought on to the field. But there is much, much more to be done. #p#If they are skilled and contrary enough to get away with it against most sides and players, to expect to do so against the game's greatest modern-day batsman, in such a setting, is to expect miracles.

Annie, shaking her head, said they wanted to feel the emotions of the people and immerse themselves into the big occasion that was an India versus Pakistan match. She said there was no way she and her family would sit anywhere else than with the crowd. It is a unique experience. Only few events in team sport - probably 'The Old Firm' (Rangers v Celtic) - attract such fervour where the political tensions and the fractured history between two neighbours stoke up the fires when they meet on the field of play. "We wanted to sit in the crowds to experience the atmosphere," Annie said. #p#And it was some atmosphere. The journalist inside me found it hard to stay neutral, to sit on my seat and not stand up and dance, to be part of the Mexican wave, to chant slogans, cheer, jeer, dance, clap. It was impossible to sit and stay quiet. Even if I tried to, the fans around me would shout, stare, whistle, scream in my ears and make sure I was distracted. It was hard being a neutral when the rest around me were gunning for Pakistan's downfall. #p#At 2 pm, when Shahid Afridi called the toss wrong the crowd came up with a spirited cheer. When Sachin Tendulkar walked out in the company of Virender Sehwag to open the Indian innings it grew a few more notches. When Sehwag slapped Umar Gul for a powerful cover drive the noise reached a crescendo. Mohali was rocking and Lahore, supposedly closer to Chandigarh than New Delhi is, could have heard the noise. Back in Mohali, Afridi had swung his hands like the pendulum in the old wall clock before pacing a few steps up and down the pitch while MS Dhoni told Ravi Shastri that there was no pressure playing in front of a full house at home. Afridi said the semi-final was his biggest match as captain. #p#"Is it a big game", I asked a couple of Pakistani fans. One of them, holding aloft the Pakistan flag, simply said "we just want to enjoy." Minutes later an Indian gentleman walked up to the same fan, and politely shook hands and exchanged courtesies. "All the best brother," the Indian man said very formally. When the time came for the team's national anthems, every Indian stood up and sang proudly. According to Sharda Ugra, ESPNcricinfo's senior editor, who has seen every India match this World Cup, this was the first time the whole stadium was singing the national anthem so loudly. The captains, who need to behave as ambassadors for their countries, can be diplomatic but the fan is always stirred by the rivalry, which is registered in his subconscious. And he uses events like today to make sure he is heard. In a bizarre way it does instill belief in the players. #p#Today when India seemed to have floundered after getting off to a bright start and seemed to be losing the plot once Dhoni played a wrong shot, the fans sitting around me started singing religious chants intensely. Men, women, boys, girls all gathered force to give momentum to the prayer. In that moment, these people seemed less like cricket fans and more like belonging to some cult. It was not blind, this fervour. The fans do believe that they can uplift the tempo of the match and they would do anything possible to help their team. A good example was when superstitions took over instinctively when the Pakistan wickets failed to fall at the desired rate. Many clairvoyant fans kept predicting the outcome on the next delivery and kept failing but did not give up. "Sit down, sit down, wickets are falling," said a fan speaking with a South Indian accent. The rest of the fans obliged. Everyone urged others to join the wave of emotion and support. It was contagious. #p#The fan uses events like today to make sure he is heard Getty Images Enlarge #p#A group of Indian teenage girls squeaked " Jitega bhai jitega Pakistan jitega (Pakistan will win)." As soon as they started chanting in support of Pakistan, the Indians around them rolled their eyes. But the girls had not yet delivered the punch line. "India ne joke mara. Ha ha ha (India played a joke)," the girls chuckled their way and drew a good clap. The Pakistani fan corner was not quiet either. When the Indian middle order lost its way after the fall of Gautam Gambhir, Virat Kohli and Yuvraj Singh the Pakistanis unveiled a banner that read: "Munnis & Sheelas are back in the pavilion," after two famous Bollywood numbers. There was a lot of eye-balling from the Indians of the miniscule Pakistan fans' contingent, which was like a drop to the ocean of the Indian tri-colour. Most of the Pakistan fans were either top functionaries in the PCB or in a corporate sponsor of the Pakistan board. They were not used to listening to people but today they were heckled. #p#Riaz, who bowled spectacularly to pick his maiden ODI five-for, returned from the field briefly during the change of innings carrying a few bottles of water meant for his family sitting in the stands. Seven members of his family including his parents, sister, younger brother and a niece had travelled by road to reach Chandigarh close to midnight on Tuesday. Annie, trying hard to keep her daughter in check in the crowded stands, said that her brother, before leaving for the World Cup, had said that the one thing he would like to do if Pakistan met India was to erase the bad memories of the only time he had played them in the past. Few years ago in Dhaka, in a tri-series, Riaz was belted for 86 off 9.2 overs before being removed midway into his final over after he bowled consecutive beamers. "He just said that he was not under any pressure at all and would do his best," Annie said. #p#Everybody wanted to be a hero. " Chak de India (Go India)", a middle-aged, rotund Pakistan fan, who had been waving his flag and dancing all day, screamed looking in the direction of the Indian fans. Instantly he drew big cheers. A fan recorded himself for posterity, citing that he was part of "such a high voltage match. It is a crazy atmosphere," he screamed into the phone as he pirouetted on one leg to catch a 360 degree angle of the stadium. On days like these every fan becomes an actor. The cricket arena becomes a world stage. #p#Outside in the streets after India's victory fans blew horns, sat atop roofs and bonnets of their four-wheelers screaming "Indiaaaa, Indiaaaa" Fireworks lit up the sky as groups of people gathered around various town squares to dance to the popular bhangra music. An ice-cream vendor even gave a discount of five rupees. #p#Yet in the end one image remained. A five-year-old toddler sat in the front row to my right. Throughout the match he had stayed quiet. A cute face, he only smiled whenever there was a wicket or a four. Each time either of the two contestants scored a point over the other, this kid would raise the flag of that country. For him, both teams were the winners.

It was believed it would be dominated by an epic performance from a handful of cricketers who would make game-altering, life-changing contributions over 100 overs. It would be a grand declaration of skill that befitted a contest watched by heads of state and government meeting at a cricket ground to talk about peace because a match had suddenly broken out in the neighbourhood. #p#Nothing of the sort. India's 29-run win over Pakistan was steadily carved out amid the heat and noise of Mohali not by its aristocracy but its plebs: the bit-part men who live in the halfway house between belonging and dispensability in the XI. Who can be picked and dropped at a fluctuating rate that is faster than the stock exchange. #p#The big occasion in Mohali today didn't quite find the alpha males. India's World Cup MVP was sent back home within a minute of arrival, by a swinging full-toss, and Sachin Tendulkar scratched out an 85 that was quite the opposite of one his many routine, treasured, "chanceless" innings. #p#It wasn't a night made by India's batsmen or even the improved Yuvraj Singh, now virtually considered the team's fifth bowler, in his new allrounder avatar, or even Zaheer Khan on a hot streak as a partnership breaker. The men who did the thorough rigorous housekeeping when 260 had to be defended were the ones who have not been certainties in an Indian starting line-up through the tournament. #p#Ashish Nehra and Munaf Patel will never make crowds go wild. What they did against Pakistan all through their multiple spells of right hand-left hand art, was to ensure that the oxygen levels during the chase began to slowly drop. #p#It was Munaf who struck the earlier of the two, varying his pace - bowling some cutters and some that to the naked eye, never mind the speed gun reading of 140kph, looked quicker. He of the wild hair, big smile, relaxed manner and the most dangerous of variations, cracked open the Pakistani middle order. Munaf abhors width but he understands depth and significance. The wicket of Abdul Razzaq, who played securely for everything except the ball that was bowled to him, was to be the sign that India had switched on the exit sign for their neighbours. #p#Nehra was a man mercilessly pilloried for conceding 16 to South Africa in a final over during a group game in Nagpur. South Africa are heading home and Nehra is still around, pickpocket run-up, mournful game face and ability now to use his left-armer's approach to find invisible protractor angles to right-hand batsmen. He was brought into the game because, MS Dhoni confessed, the Indians had read the wicket incorrectly. Their choice of bowler to step in turned out to be right, though, and Nehra knew what had to be done, and particularly how, in Mohali where the ball begins swinging for about an hour and a half in the second session. He bowled in four spells on Wednesday unrewarded until his last two overs, when he cleaned up the tail, 7-0-22-0 turning into 10-0-33-2. #p#Pros like Nehra and Patel can run rings around batsmen unsure of themselves, like the Pakistanis were on Wednesday, and trip them up on those very rings. Dhoni said that while India's bowlers were far from express, their stock in trade was their deception and their ability to change length, line and speed depending on the conditions. #p#India's win was steadily carved out amid the heat and noise of Mohali not by its aristocracy but its plebs: the bit-part men who live in the halfway house between belonging and dispensability in the XI #p#It could go unnoticed and he is definitely a bit-part player, but in the afternoon, Suresh Raina's innings of 36 became India's last push up the incline, after an early burst from the openers was turned into a long, dry passage in the middle. He came in at an awkward time, in the 37th over, and lost his senior partner, Dhoni, inside the next half hour. Stretching before Raina were more than eight overs with the tail for company and a final Powerplay to be taken. The batsman known best for his flamboyant shot-making went about his innings with faith in his partners, and surety and confidence in what he was doing. It was as if Raina had not stopped batting since the quarter-final in Ahmedabad. #p#Dhoni said Raina's had been an innings of measured calculation, particularly as he was batting alongside the tail. "It was important to rotate strike, and with their best bowlers bowling at that point, he had to make sure he had to bat the full number of overs and to see if he could capitalise on the Powerplay." India's track record in this World Cup's batting Powerplays had usually been centered around a collapse but against Pakistan, led by Raina it ended up being 43 for 1. Dhoni said that it was one of India's better Powerplay performances in the World Cup: "Even though there weren't two specialist batsmen we got a fair amount of runs and that really made a difference for us" #p#Raina's was an assured performance, not quite as dramatic as against Australia but as weighty. He decided the tone at which India would end their innings. With Harbhajan Singh and Zaheer Khan, Raina put up 51 for the seventh and eighth wickets. Take it away or halve it and Pakistan would have been able to stumble into the unexpected. #p#One member of India's star cast, though, did make an impact whose ripple effect started early in the afternoon and has ended up at the door of the World Cup final. Virender Sehwag's half- hour burst of 38 gave India its kickstart, first dismantling Pakistan's leading bowler and then maximising every scoring opportunity put before him. The difference between the two teams in the 15 overs was based on Sehwag's innings. It may have looked like a typical casual dash, but what was important in this innings was not the casualness but the dash. #p#Going into Mumbai, India have taken one step closer to the World Cup. If they played expansively and boldly in Ahmedabad, in Mohali they took what would be small, secure steps that could go virtually unheralded but did the business. #p#In the last week, over their two knockout games, where teams usually unravel, India have looked more and more sure of how they are going to get to their destination. They have won and lost tosses, they have chased and they have defended, and always they have known how to seize control. They are now the emphatic favourites to win the title, Mohali emphasising the chasm that now exists between India and Pakistan on the field. The rivalry is a heart-thumping business for the fans, but in the middle it is evident which team is accepted and recognised as better than the other. #p#In the dressing room India were watched by Mike Horn, adventurer extraordinaire, who has been speaking to the side about his experiences circumnavigating the Arctic Circle and going around the world without motorised transport. His presence has taken the ranks of the team's support staff to 12. In Mohali on Wednesday, though, it was the on-field support crew who proved they can soak up pressure like industrial-sized sponges. What were once considered the weak links of the Indian team have turned out to be its toughest cookies. And with no crumbling.
48	508839			Rahul Bhasin		Choice of game India v Pakistan in a World Cup semi-final. I don't think I need to give a reason why I went for this match. Just the fact that I was able to get my hands on tickets was a miracle in itself. #p# Team supported "India! India! India! India!" (Forgive me for the chants, but mentally I'm still in the stadium). #p# World Cup prediction I'm going to go with India as the winner, partly because I am an Indian, but also because they are a very, very formidable side right now. Sri Lanka are very strong, no doubt, but I just get this feeling that this Cup is destined to go to India. #p# Key performer Sachin Tendulkar. The minute he went, the match could have gone either way. #p# One thing I'd have changed Security. It was understandable why it was tight, but it was a problem that could have been taken care of if preparations were better. #p# Accessories I wore the Indian jersey along with a tri-coloured jester's hat with bells on it. I also carried a big flag and a whistle. #p# Face-off I relished Sehwag v Gul was a sight to behold. Those five fours in an over were worth paying the price of entry once again. Absolutely brutal. #p# Wow moment Tendulkar's two third-umpire referrals. The first was a leg-before decision overturned on review. And the other was a stumping chance, which we thought was out till we saw the replay. In fact, both had seemed out when seen with the naked eye, and getting the referral in his favour twice was just something else. #p# Shot of the day Umar Akmal's six off Yuvraj Singh in the 32nd over. It seemed like a match-turning shot, and it went over the bowler's head. Fortunately for India, his innings didn't last long. #p# Crowd meter The stands were beyond packed. It was more than a full house. I think there were more people inside the stadium than the actual capacity. The Indian team had huge support, but the crowd also applauded the Pakistan players when they deserved it. However there weren't that many Pakistani supporters in my stand. #p# Besides the usual "Sachin! Sachin!" and "Jeetega bhai jeetega, India jeetega!" (India will win!), there was one particular chant that went on for a while, which I really liked: "Pakistan sangharsh karo, hum tumhare saath hai! Tum humare bachche ho, hum tumhare baap hai!" (Rough translation: Pakistan try harder, we support you! You're our children, we're your daddy.) #p# Fancy-dress index I'd say nearly every spectator had his or her face painted and was wearing an India jersey. Besides that, I didn't see anything fancy. There was a man in a Santa Claus outfit; hats off to him for wearing that for 100 overs in the Mohali heat. #p# Banner of the day "I wasn't born in 83. Do it for me!" Maybe because I feel the same way. #p# ODI v Twenty20 No comparison. A well-played ODI is better than a Twenty20 anytime. This is my third World Cup game, after the West Indies v South Africa game and India v South Africa. I remember every detail from these matches. I also went to two IPL matches in 2010. I remember what teams were playing but I just can't recall the results or any of the individual performances. #p# Marks out of 10 10. Absolutely brilliant. Amazing atmosphere. Great game of cricket. What more can you ask for in a semi-final? 
48	508967	India v Pakistan, 2nd semi-final, World Cup 2011	Is this really patriotism?	Aakash Chopra	April 1, 2011	Fans celebrating after India's win in Mohali: is this really good-spirited patriotism ? Associated Press Enlarge Related Links Matches: India v Pakistan at Mohali Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: India | Pakistan #p#Was it really good-spirited patriotism that strutted itself in all forms decipherable in the lead up the semi-final game against Pakistan, or was it in fact an obsessive case of fervent jingoism? The support for the Indian team bordered on crass, the nation did not just support Team India but ridiculed the opposition. The media, in order to grab eyeballs and increase TRPs, went to unimaginable extremes and added fuel to the fire. Losing to Pakistan seemed no longer an option for the Men in Blue. But wasn't it a game of cricket in which one side had to lose? Yes, it was the semi-final of the World Cup and hence an important game, but would the build-up have been the same if the opponent had been any other team? I doubt it. In fact, now that we have beaten Pakistan it's considered okay if we lose to Sri Lanka in the final, for we have been avenged. Don't you find it strange? What does it tell you about our evolution as a responsible nation? #p#Let me go back to the 1920s when India was reeling under the British rule and cricket, a European sport, was finding its feet in India. There was an annual quadrangular tournament featuring a team each of Hindus, Muslims, Parsis and the British. Initially, these matches were played and seen as a sport but when the freedom movement gained steam, the stakes changed too. These annual cricket encounters were seen and used as the vehicles to assert our presence and our right to freedom. Every British loss on the cricket pitch was viewed as the nation's victory over its rulers. And one could easily relate to those emotions because the country was struggling for its existence and survival. But even then the Indians (called natives) didn't take up the sport to get even with the rulers; they took it up because they liked playing it. #p#Post independence and the division of the country, we just carried forward the same sentiment i.e. sport being the vehicle to assert supremacy. The relations between India and Pakistan remained sour for the longest time. We've fought wars and still continue to have other equally important issues plaguing us. Yet, there's enough reason to believe that we as people, have matured and come a long way in trimming down that animosity, especially via Bollywood and numerous other cultural exchanges, perhaps reiterating time and again that the rivalry is only political. Or at least I'd like to believe that India has definitely evolved and has become a responsible nation. Unfortunately though, all it took was a cricket match to topple that process of evolution. Are we not, in a sense, pushing ourselves back a 100 years? #p#Besides that would it not be fair to spare a moment of thought for cricketers involved in the game? We cricketers are also the product of the environment we've grown in. We also understand the importance of an India-Pakistan game and dearly want to beat them every time we meet. But we also realise that it might not be possible every single time, for a game of cricket is not won by the team that is more emotionally charged but by that team which executes its plans properly and has the skill to support those plans. We know that we carry the expectations of a billion people and would do anything to not let them down. But at the same time we are humans too and can take only so much pressure. We try to insulate ourselves by not reading the newspapers or watching the news channels but despite our best efforts, we can't completely go into our cocoon. While we want to think positively all the time, the thought of a possible loss followed by a backlash finds its way into our mind. What if we lose this game against Pakistan? Will our effigies be burnt across India? Will our houses be vandalised and will our families be safe? Will we be the nation's pariah just because we couldn't win a game of cricket? #p#It's about time that we, as a nation, answer these questions. Are we going to behave like this every time we play Pakistan? If we detest them so much, it may not be a bad idea to severe all cricketing ties with them, for a cricket match can't be used as a benchmark to prove our superiority as a nation. Every time we behave like the way we did this time, it pulls us down as a responsible nation #p#You must be thinking right now -- since we love you so much, it's only fair to receive the ridicule. While we agree that we are what we are because of your love and support, we are humans too who can and should be allowed to fail from time to time. Memories from 2003 loom large in my mind, when fans vandalised Mohammad Kaif's house and left the players completely gobsmacked. For the first time ever, we felt unsure about our families, and their safety back home. I also vividly remember my tour to Pakistan in 2004. That was the first time I saw cricket being the lead story on the front page of all national dailies for almost every single day. As a player, however much you want the recognition, you'd rather stay within the sports pages, for the repercussions of featuring on the front pages can be manifold. We have in a way, learnt to take even appreciation with a pinch of salt. #p#I, personally, have taken immense pleasure when we defeated Pakistan in Multan and Rawalpindi and felt gutted when we lost to them at Lahore. The point I'm trying to make is that we also go through the same set of emotions as you do, albeit objectively. And believe me, the Pakistan cricketers, who are otherwise a friendly lot, don't forget to remind us about the repercussions of a possible loss during an event. While they envy the status our cricketers enjoy, they're happy that their country receives a loss in a much better fashion. England did not go to Zimbabwe during the 2003 World Cup because they received threats. While the English players were warned by the outsiders, cricketers in India get that word of warning, quite strangely, from their own fans. #p#It's about time that we, as a nation, answer these questions. Are we going to behave like this every time we play Pakistan? If we detest them so much, it may not be a bad idea to sever all cricketing ties with them, for a cricket match can't be used as a benchmark to prove our superiority as a nation. Every time we behave like the way we did this time, it pulls us down as a responsible nation. The choice is ours.
48	509008	India v Pakistan, 2nd semi-final, World Cup 2011	Ajmal still baffled by Tendulkar lbw reversal	ESPNcricinfo staff	April 1, 2011	Wahab Riaz: ""The wickets of [Virender] Sehwag and Yuvraj [Singh] were most memorable for me" Getty Images Enlarge Related Links News : Hawk-Eye dismisses doubts over Tendulkar lbw Players/Officials: Intikhab Alam | Mohammad Hafeez | Saeed Ajmal | Wahab Riaz Matches: India v Pakistan at Mohali Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Pakistan #p#Pakistan offspinner Saeed Ajmal has said that he is still not sure how the Decision Review System (DRS) overturned on-field umpire Ian Gould's lbw ruling against Sachin Tendulkar during the World Cup semi-final against India in Mohali. Gould ruled Tendulkar lbw off Ajmal in the 11th over, but the batsman reviewed the decision. Replays showed that the ball pitched in line but according to Hawk Eye the ball was missing leg stump and the decision was overturned. #p#"I don't know how the television replays showed my delivery turning towards the leg side because I had bowled an arm ball and it went straight," Ajmal told AFP on the team's arrival in Lahore. "I was 110% confident when the referral was made that the batsman was out." Tendulkar was on 23 at that point, and survived four dropped chances before he was dismissed after making a crucial 85 that earned him the Man of the Match award. #p#Ajmal picked up two wickets and said that he was happy with his bowling performance but disappointed that Pakistan lost the high-voltage clash to India by 29 runs. "All of us were very disappointed at losing the match because there was so much interest and hype attached to it. But in cricket one team has to lose and one has to win," he said. #p#The pick of the Pakistan bowlers in that game was left-arm seamer Wahab Riaz who picked up his first five-wicket haul in ODIs and had India in trouble at 205 for 6 before Suresh Raina's cameo. "The wickets of [Virender] Sehwag and Yuvraj [Singh] were most memorable for me as they are very dangerous players of pace and spin," Riaz said. Riaz had Sehwag lbw for 38 and accounted for Yuvraj Singh for a duck with a swinging, dipping full toss. #p#Pakistan were warmly welcomed by their fans when they arrived in Lahore and captain Shahid Afridi, who landed in Karachi, was mobbed by joyous fans on the way to his house. Opening batsman Mohammad Hafeez, who made a quick-fire 43, urged the Pakistan fans to have faith in the team. "This team has a lot of capability and will get better results in the future," he said. #p#Pakistan manager Intikhab Alam praised the team spirit and said the way the team had gelled together and played as a unit through the tournament was the most satisfying aspect of the campaign. "My main task was to unite the team and make it perform collectively and I think we achieved that to a great extent and that is satisfying for me." #p#Pakistan next travel to West Indies to play Twenty20, five one-dayers and two Tests. That tour begins on April 18.
48	509589	World Cup 2011	Three sleepless nights before semi-final - Riaz	ESPNcricinfo staff	April 5, 2011	'I planned how and where to bowl to each [India] batsman' - Wahab Riaz Getty Images Enlarge Related Links Players/Officials: Wahab Riaz Matches: India v Pakistan at Mohali Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Pakistan #p#Wahab Riaz, who picked up his maiden ODI five-for in the World Cup semi-final against India, had spent three sleepless nights ahead of the clash planning his strategy for India's batsmen. Though admittedly disappointed that the performance had come in a losing cause, the extensive preparation, he said, is what helped him deliver in the high-pressure match. #p#"I had three sleepless nights ahead of the semi-final," Riaz told the Express Tribune. "I planned how and where to bowl to each batsman. The planning, and the confidence the team management showed in me, was crucial to my success in that all-important game. #p#"There was a lot of disappointment when we lost to India. It was sad to fall just short of making it to the final," he said. "We failed to build partnerships in that match. I believe a couple of significant partnerships could have made the difference and given us the win." #p#Riaz, who claimed a five-for on Test debut against England last August made Pakistan's World Cup squad after bans were handed out to fast bowlers Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Amir for spot fixing. He made it to the playing XI on the back of Pakistan's bowling attack being ripped apart during a late assault by New Zealand's Ross Taylor in a group match in Pallekele on March 8. #p#Riaz said the team spirit displayed by Pakistan during the World Cup was key to their good performance. "We were a side that no one took seriously before the tournament but we still reached the last-four, as we were united and supported each other. I firmly believe cricket is a team game and once every player in the side pulls his weight, the winning graph goes up. We should now look ahead, rather than keep focussing on the [semi-final] defeat. Constantly lamenting the loss will only be detrimental for us."
48	509796	India v Pakistan, 2nd semi-final, World Cup 2011, Mohali	Hawk-Eye dismisses doubts over Tendulkar lbw	ESPNcricinfo staff	April 6, 2011	Sachin Tendulkar was eventually dismissed for 85 Getty Images Enlarge Related Links News : Ajmal still baffled by Tendulkar lbw reversal In Focus: Technology in cricket Players/Officials: Saeed Ajmal | Sachin Tendulkar Matches: India v Pakistan at Mohali Teams: India | Pakistan #p#Hawk-Eye Innovations, the company responsible for the ball-tracking technology used in the DRS during the World Cup, has sought to dismiss doubts over the accuracy of the technology during the semi-final between India and Pakistan when an lbw decision against Sachin Tendulkar was overturned by the referral system. The company has published a detailed report of the Tendulkar referral on its website. #p#"The path Hawk-Eye showed was accurate and the Decision Review System was used correctly to overturn the umpire's original decision," Stephen Carter, managing director of Hawk-Eye Innovations told the Guardian. "The Hawk-Eye track lines up perfectly with the video of the real ball from release to impact point." #p#Tendulkar was ruled out lbw by umpire Ian Gould in the 11th over, bowled by Saeed Ajmal when on 23 (he went on to make 85). After much deliberation, Tendulkar asked for a referral and replays showed that the ball, delivered from an angle, pitched outside the line of off stump before turning in to hit his front pad in front of middle. Hawk-Eye suggested that the ball would have gone on to miss leg stump. Ajmal, after the game, expressed bafflement, claiming he had bowled an arm ball that went on straight when it had appeared as though the ball had been an offspinner that spun down after pitching in line. #p#"The commentators said on air that Tendulkar had been 'caught on the crease'," Carter said on his website. "From the front-on angle it does look like Tendulkar has been hit when batting in his crease. However, Tendulkar was almost two metres out of his crease when struck." #p#He also dismissed suggestions that the wrong ball may have been superimposed during the referral. "Theoretically it is possible but in a practical sense you couldn't superimpose a wrong ball," he said. "It would not line up perfectly and it would be perfectly obvious to everybody."
49	509288	India v Sri Lanka, final, World Cup 2011, Mumbai	The partnerships that won the Cup	S Rajesh	April 2, 2011	The wagon-wheel of MS Dhoni's runs scored in front of the wicket on the off side: 48 of his runs came in this region ESPNcricinfo Ltd Enlarge Related Links Report : Dhoni and Gambhir lead India to World Cup glory Players/Officials: MS Dhoni | Gautam Gambhir | Mahela Jayawardene Matches: India v Sri Lanka at Mumbai Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: India | Sri Lanka #p#At two wickets down for 31, chasing a target of 275 in a World Cup final, it all seemed to be headed in Sri Lanka's direction. In all ODIs since 2000, a first-innings total of 270 or more had been a winning score 394 times, while only 100 times had it been chased down. Add to that the pressures of the occasion - only twice in nine previous finals had the team batting second won a World Cup final, plus no side had ever lost their first wicket without a run on the board - and there was no doubt about which team held the whip at that stage. #p#That's when India's middle order stepped up, with a couple of stunning partnerships that completely turned the run-chase around. Virat Kohli and Gautam Gambhir's 83-run partnership consumed only 15.3 overs and resurrected India's innings, while the Gambhir-MS Dhoni stand more or less sealed the deal, adding an outstanding 109 off 19.4 overs to ensure the highest sucessful run-chase in a World Cup final. #p#The highlight of both those partnerships was the manner in which the batsmen soaked up the pressure, kept the risks to a minimum, and yet scored their runs at an excellent rate. In the third-wicket stand, Gambhir and Kohli scored only 32 out of 83 runs in fours and yet scored at 5.35 runs per over. Gambhir and Dhoni were even better, scoring 32 out of 109 in fours, yet achieving a run-rate of 5.54. #p#Going into this innings, Dhoni's performances with the bat had been disappointing, but there were no half-measures about the way he batted today. He showed, once again, his ability to excel in a run-chase: in 81 innings when he has batted second, Dhoni averaged 50.92, with 19 fifties and two hundreds. Among batsmen who've scored at least 2500 runs batting second, only Michael Bevan has a higher average. #p#Of the 91 runs he scored, more than half - 48 - came in the region between point and mid-off, several of them through back-foot punches off the spinners. Muttiah Muralitharan went for 22 off 22 balls, while Suraj Randiv conceded 14 off 15, as Dhoni repeatedly made room and played against the spin, carving the ball through cover and extra cover. #p#The other key contribution came from Gambhir, who clearly relishes playing Sri Lanka. Four of his nine ODI hundreds have come against them, and he almost made it a fifth with a superbly paced 97. One of the key tasks he accomplished was playing out Muralitharan and Lasith Malinga: 42 out of the 122 balls he faced were from them, and though he scored only 28 from those deliveries, he did his job by playing out a fair number. #p#The key partnerships for India For wkt Runs Balls 1s/ 2s 4s/ 6s 3rd 83 93 27/ 9 8/ 0 4th 109 118 49/ 11 8/ 0 #p#Overall, there was little to choose between the Sri Lankan and Indian innings.

Clive Lloyd, Viv Richards, Aravinda de Silva, Ricky Ponting and Adam Gilchrist had all scored hundreds in winning causes, but Mahela Jayawardene's sublime 103 not out wasn't enough to seal the win for Sri Lanka. None of that was Jayawardene's fault, though, as he crafted a magnificent knock, scoring at at least a run a ball against each of the Indian bowlers. Zaheer Khan, so incisive in his opening spell, was taken apart by Jayawardene, who scored 23 from 14 balls off Zaheer. #p#The flawless manner in which Jayawardene batted made it look as if he was batting on another pitch. A comparison of his innings' stats with those of the other Sri Lankan batsmen illustrate the gulf: Jayawardene didn't score off less than 32% of the deliveries he faced; for the rest of his team, that percentage was more than 56. #p#This was also the first of Jayawardene's 14 ODI hundreds which ended in defeat. Considering how classy the knock was, it probably deserved a better result. #p#Jayawardene v the rest of the Sri Lankan batsmen Runs Balls Strike rate Dot balls Dot ball % Mahela Jayawardene 103 88 117.04 28 31.82 Rest of SL team 159 214 74.30 120 56.07
49	509297	India v Sri Lanka, final, World Cup 2011, Mumbai	'We're going to miss Murali terribly' - Sangakkara	ESPNcricinfo staff	April 2, 2011	India deprived Muttiah Muralitharan of the send-off he sought Associated Press Enlarge Related Links News : Malinga says wet ball hampered bowling News : We felt the pressure - Dhoni Players/Officials: Muttiah Muralitharan | Kumar Sangakkara Matches: India v Sri Lanka at Mumbai Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Sri Lanka #p#Kumar Sangakkara rued not being able to give Muttiah Muralitharan the perfect send-off in what was his final international appearance for Sri Lanka and admitted the team would "miss him terribly." Sri Lanka were beaten by six wickets in the World Cup final by India in Mumbai and Murali, on one of his rare off days, went wicketless in eight overs and conceded 39 runs. #p#"It's one of those rare days when he hasn't really done the job for us, but it happens maybe once in a 100 games," Sangakkara said. "We're going to miss him terribly. Unfortunately we couldn't give him a great send-off but that's the way it goes. We were outplayed and we have to accept that." #p#Sri Lanka had done well after winning the toss, posting 274 thanks to a superlative century from Mahela Jayawardene. They were in command when Lasith Malinga dismissed India's openers, Virender Sehwag and Sachin Tendulkar, early in the chase. But the Indian middle order stepped up with Gautam Gambhir and MS Dhoni reviving the innings with match-winning half-centuries. #p#Murali was dealt with easily by Gambhir and Dhoni, who hit him repeatedly to the extra-cover boundary. Murali had come into this game with a groin injury, and while it was considered a risk to play him, the game was just too big to leave him out. Sangakkara, however, said fitness didn't affect Murali's performance. #p#"He's our best bowler, even if half-fit," Sangakkara said. "But he was fine, he was almost at full fitness when he played today. I don't think it was an issue." #p#Murali had ended his Test career on a high, picking up a wicket with his final delivery to win Sri Lanka a game against India last year. And while that perfect ending eluded him this World Cup, Sangakkara summed up what he meant for Sri lanka. "Murali is the icon of Sri Lanka," he said. "As a champion on the field and off the field. As a human being and a cricketer, I don't think there is anyone to match him."
49	509300	India v Sri Lanka, final, World Cup 2011, Mumbai	'India were a step ahead of us' - Sangakkara	ESPNcricinfo staff	April 2, 2011	#p#Kumar Sangakkara, the Sri Lanka captain, took heart from his team's performance to reach the final of the World Cup but described the defeat to India in Mumbai as "hugely disappointing" It was Sri Lanka's third defeat - starting with the World Cup in the West Indies, followed by the World Twenty20 in England - in a global tournament final since 2007 and Sangakkara regretted not grabbing what he said was a "once in a lifetime opportunity." #p#"It is hugely disappointing but satisfying as well in a strange sense because we understand the magnitude of what we've done to get here," Sangakkara said. "We can be proud of the way we played our cricket. We tried exceptionally hard to win games, but today unfortunately we couldn't convert." #p#Sri Lanka had the upper hand after Mahela Jayawardene scored a sublime century to take them to 274 and Lasith Malinga struck early to remove the Indian openers. There had been confusion during the toss, which had to redone after, as Sangakkara claimed, Dhoni thought his counterpart had called incorrectly, while the others weren't able to hear the call. Sangakkara won the second toss but said the score his team managed after batting first wasn't adequate given the depth of the Indian batting line-up. "Batting first and putting those runs up on the board was never enough the way the Indians batted," he said. "Their batting is unbelievable. They probably have the best top seven in ODI cricket." #p#Gautam Gambhir and MS Dhoni struck match-winning 90s to get India's chase on track after those two early setbacks, and Sangakkara admitted his bowlers didn't apply enough pressure. "After we got the first two wickets, we weren't really tight enough with our bowling. We bowled quite a few loose balls and Gambhir and Kohli made us pay for that. MS really stuck it out there and saw through the tough periods. Once they matched and then went past the asking-rate, it was very difficult to pull them back. #p#The World Cup eluded Kumar Sangakkara's team in a gripping final Getty Images Enlarge #p#"It was a great pitch, it lasted throughout. It turned a little in the middle part of the innings but the Indians are great players of spin. We didn't bother them too much today apart from Malinga's two wickets at the start." #p#Dhoni's calm leadership under pressure has come in for praise this tournament and Sangakkara joined in. "Dhoni has been the epitome of captain cool. He's intelligent, very smart in the way he does things. #p#"It's a combination of various factors that has helped them win in different conditions. We also have played very well against them, but playing at home they took that inspiration that one step further." #p#Sangakkara also lauded Jayawardene for helping Sri Lanka overcome a slow start and set a challenging target. It was the first time a batsman ended up on the losing side in a World Cup final after scoring a century. "It was an exceptional innings. He made this wonderful stage his own. He really showed us what he is capable of and what a classy player he is. He got us to where we reached, otherwise we were looking at a total of 240-250. #p#"It doesn't matter how often you play each other. It is the World Cup final. You need to do something special. We had that in Jayawardene and they had that in Gambhir and Dhoni. They were one step ahead of us." #p#Sangakkara also acknowledged the contribution of Trevor Bayliss, the Sri Lanka coach, who will be stepping down. "Trevor grounded us very well. A lot of old-fashioned hard work, a lot of common sense. He's a man of few words but what he does say really counts. He's been one of our most successful coaches."
49	509303	India v Sri Lanka, final, World Cup 2011, Mumbai	Sri Lanka let down sublime Jayawardene	Sambit Bal at the Wankhede Stadium	April 2, 2011	Grace on a cricket field - Mahela Jayawardene AFP Enlarge Related Links Features : Sri Lanka's heartbeat News : Century no consolation for Jayawardene News : We felt the pressure - Dhoni Players/Officials: Mahela Jayawardene Matches: India v Sri Lanka at Mumbai Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: Sri Lanka #p#The World Cup hasn't been blessed with grand finals. From a distance now, 1975 looks much closer than it actually was; 1983 was memorable because it produced a stunning upset; and 1992 was sealed with two magic balls from Wasim Akram. Only 1987 produced a tense finish, but it was played between two middling teams. To the dispassionate eye, the regret about 2011 will be that Sri Lanka, so clinical until the final, were so off the boil on the field that the biggest chase in a World Cup final became a canter in the end. #p#Sri Lanka had the distinction of chasing the highest score to win a World Cup. In 1996 they were generously assisted by the dew in Lahore as they knocked off 241 with plenty to spare. While dew was a factor on Saturday night too, Sri Lanka were so feeble on the field that 274 felt like 50 short. Kumar Sangakkara was full of grace in conceding India's superiority in the contest, but when he said they would have needed 350 to challenge India, he might have been reflecting on his team's out-cricket. #p#It was a pity because it rendered absolutely inconsequential a magnificent hundred from Mahela Jayawardene. #p#In fact, it could be said that there were two Sri Lankas in the final in Mumbai. There was Jayawardene: beautiful, balanced and inspired. And then there was the Sri Lanka on the field: sloppy, uncoordinated, listless and a bundle of nerves. India were worthy winners because they carried more class and depth, but Sri Lanka's inability to stretch them despite the early tremors caused by Lasith Malinga robbed the final of the tension it deserved. #p#Jayawardene must feel hard done by because the world remembers only winners. His team-mates didn't drop as many catches as Pakistan did in the semi final - in fact, Tillakaratne Dilshan grabbed a stunner off his own bowling to dismiss Virat Kohli - but they leaked so many runs in the field that the India batsmen, once they settled down, were never made to work hard. #p#This was in dramatic contrast to the Indian fielding effort that peaked on Saturday, after gradually improving through the knockout stages. Now trimmer and considerably fitter, Yuvraj Singh, back in his old position at point, was electric: and, along with Suresh Raina and Virat Kohli, he formed an offside cordon the Sri Lankan top order found impossible to breach. They starved Sri Lanka of singles by attacking the ball and cut off certain boundaries with spectacular dives. Even the fast bowlers, usually liabilities in the outfield, seemed to have acquired springs. Zaheer Khan saved a couple of fours at third man, and Sreesanth sprinted and slid at square leg to stop another. #p#While India rose well above themselves, Sri Lanka, though never among the most sparkling fielding sides, sunk way below their usual standards, and the combined difference could well have been 40 runs. This piece of comic fielding summed up the Sri Lankan performance: Gautam Gambhir sliced Muttiah Muralitharan straight to point where Chamara Kapugedera fumbled the ball, allowing a single, and then fired in a throw wide of the bowler to concede another run. #p#With the ball too, Sri Lanka were below par. Malinga produced two huge wickets when it was least expected. He hasn't been a threat with the new ball throughout the World Cup and to nail Virender Sehwag and Sachin Tendulkar in his first spell was a huge bonus. But Malinga couldn't do the job expected from him and MS Dhoni and Yuvraj picked him off easily when he returned for what could have been a match-turning spell. #p#Murali was perhaps not fully fit and got easily annoyed with the wet ball and Suraj Randiv, who was brought in as cover for Murali but played ahead of Ajantha Mendis and Rangana Herath, was the most economical bowler of the day but never threatened to produce a wicket. Nuwan Kulasekara and Thilan Perera more than compensated for the absence of Angelo Mathews with the bat but they were clearly ill equipped as lead bowlers. Sometimes in seeking to address the conditions, teams veer away from their strengths. #p#What a let-down this effort was for Jayawardene, who produced an innings worthy of a final. The world feels a lovely place when he gets going, but beauty is nothing without purpose and substance. His was a beautifully structured innings that first lifted Sri Lanka from a sluggish start and then gradually led them towards a challenging total. As ever, Jayawardene, who had had an indifferent World Cup so far, persuaded the ball through gaps affectionately, using the pace that the pitch offered and creating space with gentle wrist work. His first fifty came off 49 balls, and the second, without any noticeable shift in gear, in 35, with the century coming with two superbly executed fours off Zaheer Khan. #p#This was his second virtuoso innings in knockout matches of successive World Cups. In 2007, his unbeaten hundred against New Zealand had come in similar circumstances (he came in to bat at 67 for 2 then, as against 60 for 2 today) and had carried his team to the final. #p#On Saturday, he became the first centurion in a losing cause in a World Cup final. How empty it must feel.
49	509304	India v Sri Lanka, final, World Cup 2011, Mumbai	The dive that defined Gambhir	Sidharth Monga at the Wankhede Stadium	April 2, 2011	The day Gautam Gambhir dived, and how AFP Enlarge Related Links News : We felt the pressure - Dhoni Report : Dhoni and Gambhir lead India to World Cup glory Players/Officials: Gautam Gambhir Matches: India v Sri Lanka at Mumbai Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: India #p#There is a photo from the World Cup final that Gautam Gambhir can be truly proud of. Yes, he will enjoy the victory pictures along with his team-mates, but this one is more personal. And no, he didn't score a century, so this is not a celebration photo. It is a picture of his completing a second run after he had punched Muttiah Muralitharan in the 19th over, two runs that took him to 49. #p#Gambhir doesn't like the 40s and the 90s; he prefers racing through those phases. He had tried to cut the previous ball even though there was a slip and two backward points at an arm's length from each other. Gambhir was a bit edgy, and the shot was uppish but fell short of one of the points. The next ball he punched straighter of point, and immediately called two. Midway during the second Gambhir realised he was struggling, and what happened next was the defining moment of his innings. He dived full length, legs and waist forming an inverted C along the ground, elbows scraping against the pitch, head inches above the turf. It will be a significant image in Gambhir's career. #p#Twice in the past Gambhir has had two potentially great ODI knocks cut short by careless run-outs. Had those innings reached appropriate completion, they would have taken him from being a very good batsman to an absolute class act. #p#The first was against Pakistan in a Champions Trophy game in 2009. To say Gambhir was charged up that day would be an understatement. India had been shoddy in letting Pakistan get 302, but Gambhir was a man possessed during the chase. He stepped out and slashed, he cover-drove like a dream, he flicked off the pads, and despite Sachin Tendukar's early dismissal, he stunned Pakistan. But just when a match-winning knock against Pakistan at a world event was being played, Rahul Dravid hit powerfully to mid-off, and both he and Gambhir took few instinctive steps, then decided against the single. Gambhir, 59 off 46 then, turned around to see Younis Khan hit the stumps direct. Had he dived then, or attempted to hurry the fielder by trying to, he would have been allowed to continue what was looking like a dream effort. Instead he had to walk back, cursing himself, and India collapsed. #p#Against Australia in the quarter-final a week ago, Gambhir had begun another match-winning effort. He came in early at the fall of Virender Sehwag and serenely took India to a position of control. In the 40s, he started running absurdly. Twice either Yuvraj Singh or Gambhir could have got run out, and on the third occasion Gambhir ran himself out, giving Australia an opening. That time Yuvraj absorbed the pressure and took India through, but Gambhir was cursing again. It could have been perfect riposte to those who were calling for his head in the initial stages of the tournament. #p#Failures, especially these careless errors, torture Gambhir, an introspective person who is hard on himself. And so they should. He is an intense person, a fiery character, a superb batsman who loves the big occasion and the strife. And yet he can be casual with the running. Not sliding the bat, not diving, overestimating his legs. Tonight he dived, and the moment he did, it seemed he was onto something special. #p#Gambhir played the second half of his innings with obvious back pain; he even seemed to have taken a painkilling tablet during one of the unscheduled drinks breaks. For this special occasion, however, Gambhir was not only charged up, he was prepared to be a workman too. Diving was not the only new thing he did. He also played the orthodox sweep, something he rarely does. The paddle sweep that guides the ball fine yes, but not the proper sweep, where he needs to get down on one knee. #p#Perhaps Gambhir is so good a player that he doesn't need to play the sweep. He uses his feet to get to the pitch of the ball, and also to go back after a decoy half step forward, creating a cuttable length. After he had looked good against pace, Gambhir tried to come down the track against spin. The first time he tried it, he nearly lost his wicket to Suraj Randiv, who got extra bounce because of his height and tall action. Then Gambhir swept the next ball. It wasn't a pretty shot, it was a shot of a man who doesn't often need to sweep. It was an effective shot though. He went on to, awkwardly again, slog-sweep Randiv for four. Kumar Sangakkara had blocked the chip and the cut with strong off-side fields, and Gambhir was improvising. Charged up for the big night he was. #p#In the 90s Gambhir got edgy again. Tiredness, back pain and edginess are hardly good bedfellows. He reached 90 in the 38th over, and in the 42nd he was still on 97. Those who have seen Gambhir enough knew he was going to charge at the bowler. Charge he did, and played a tired shot, falling three short of a match-winning century in a World Cup final, at a ground where he also has a century in a Ranji Trophy-winning final. Had he got those three runs, he would surely have been Man of the Match too. #p#As he walked back, Gambhir kept admonishing himself. Only when he was near the stairway to the dressing room did he realise the huge cheer from the crowd and acknowledge it. Despite that shot, though, Gambhir had done his job tonight, leaving MS Dhoni, Yuvraj and Suresh Raina not many to get. And that photograph is just as priceless as the hundred he should have got.
49	509312	India v Sri Lanka, final, World Cup 2011, Mumbai	We felt the pressure - Dhoni	Sharda Ugra at the Wankhede Stadium	April 3, 2011	#p#It was the first time in six weeks that MS Dhoni could be heard doing what can only be described as giggling. Usually self-contained, the India captain arrived at the underground media conference room, World Cup medal around his neck, Man-of-the-Tournament Yuvraj Singh at his side, and turned into someone else. #p#Twisted into a knot of concentration and anxiety for six weeks during the World Cup, now that the title has been won, Dhoni suddenly found he could let all the tension go, take a step back from the edge, and relax. More than once in a 25-minute conversation, Dhoni collapsed in mirth, pressing the microphone to his forehead because he couldn't remember the first part of two long questions he had been asked. Or it may have been because one of the questions wanted his reaction to some public sentiment that he should now try to run the country. #p#Normally he replies to questions only in English, even when asked in Hindi. But on Saturday night, Dhoni switched languages several times as he spoke of the strains his team had been under during the World Cup. #p#"The pressure you go through is a lot; we felt it throughout the tournament," he said before describing what it was like inside the Indian team's bubble. "If you ask the players, they were not eating well because of anxiety. Not pressure, but anxiety. There would be food in front of you but you wouldn't feel like eating it." #p#To find a way to adjust to the nervousness, Dhoni said the players tried dealing with nerves in differnt ways. "We said avoid it, do this, do that," but the strain was always felt. However, everyone in the squad had, Dhoni said, eventually coped well. "The kind of extra responsibility that each and everybody had was enormous. This is what we had wanted to achieve; we had set our eyes on it one-and-a-half years ago." #p#Sitting next to him was Yuvraj, the player who exemplified both the performance India put in and the anxiety they had been through on their way to becoming the first team to win a World Cup final at home. When Dhoni was asked how Yuvraj had been in the dressing room during the tournament, he replied with a smile: "He has been vomiting a lot," and then went on to answer the question. #p#MS Dhoni was confused with emotion for a moment after hitting the winning runs, before he reached for a stump AFP Enlarge #p#Yuvraj told ESPNcricinfo, as he crossed the Wankhede to return to his dressing room, that he had been physically ill several times during the tournament. "Anxiety, anxiety," he explained. "This was the World Cup and that anxiety can really be heavy." #p#The burden that Yuvraj and his team-mates had been carrying around over the last six weeks suddenly fell away after the final. Everything had turned into lightness. When he first entered the media conference room, Yuvraj climbed onto the dais, calling out loudly to the journalists: " badhaiyaan ho, badhaiyaan ho [congratulations, congratulations]" During the session the two men traded jokes, and towards the end, Yuvraj was heard saying under his breath to his captain in Hindi: "short answer, please." #p#Dhoni is not given to particularly short answers, except when he kills a question with a joke. He spoke lucidly of what was going through his mind after he hit the winning runs. "Emotionally, I was confused; I wanted a wicket [stump]" But he found himself at the centre of the pitch with Yuvraj at the other end. "I thought hug-vug we will do later, first take the wicket." He then ran over to his own end to pull out the stump, after which Yuvraj jumped on him, pulling him into a bear hug. "It was an emotional moment," Dhoni said. "I was confused, I didn't know what to do at the time, how to show my emotions." #p#The decision to promote himself up the order ahead of the in-form Yuvraj had also, Dhoni said, been taken under a certain kind of pressure because of the risk it involved. "It was a big decision, I knew that if I promoted myself and didn't score runs I would be asked why I couldn't stay back? If I promoted myself there would be two left-hand batsmen after me and if I got out the side may have been in trouble." #p#He said the decision was based on the logic that as Gambhir was batting well, all Dhoni would need to do was rotate strike. Also, India knew the dew factor was going to kick in and Dhoni believed he had the added advantage of being able to read Muttiah Muralitharan's doosra. "I have played a lot with Murali [for the Chennai Super Kings] and I know his doosra quite well, and he knows that also. I was able to put a bit of pressure on him" #p#The advantage of running well with Gambhir - their partnership extending back to their India A days in 2003-2004 - also tilted the decision towards promoting himself. "We don't take risky singles but try to convert one or one-and-a-half runs into two runs. It was an ideal combination and we were batting together after a long time. We ran well, and backed each other. We knew if we took the game close enough with the Powerplay left, we would achieve the target even if the runs needed were eight an over." #p#Dhoni is now India's most successful captain in limited-overs cricket, having won both the World Twenty20 and the World Cup, and when asked to explain his success, he laughed. "I'm lucky. I always get good players. The players have responded to me even if it's a Test side, where there were senior players who were part of the side before I started playing for India. Then, the youngsters coming in have contributed a lot, they have been willing to give more than 100%." He said it was "the character of the individuals [in the team] that helped us win this trophy." #p#India's win came inside the refurbished Wankhede Stadium, where the stands are now built on a vertical climb and the capacity has been reduced to 33,000. On Saturday night, however, the sound created was amplified as the partnerships for the third and fourth wickets grew. The crowd, Dhoni said, gave the batsmen strength. "During the Gambhir-Kohli partnership, ever run was applauded as if it was a boundary." #p#The dew on the ground had helped the Indian batsmen, as did the easing up of the wicket. But the key according to Dhoni was the combined effort. "It was a pressure game, but everyone contributed. When you share the pressure then it becomes easy." #p#India's performance at the World Cup, Dhoni said, had been based on a plan that was born about 18 months ago and was a result of methodically resting and rotating players. "We wanted to win the trophy for each other first. The first thing you want to do is give them [team-mates and support staff] happiness; to see it in their eyes." #p#He said that rather than try to expand the number of people for whom the World Cup was to be won, the team said: "Okay let's concentrate and keep it small. If you do well and win the World Cup, the whole country has a share in it."
49	509313	India v Sri Lanka, final, World Cup 2011, Mumbai	Perfect timing by MS Dhoni	Sidharth Monga at the Wankhede Stadium	April 3, 2011	The back-foot punch was MS Dhoni's most favoured shot and helped keep the required rate in check Associated Press Enlarge Related Links Report : Dhoni and Gambhir lead India to World Cup glory Players/Officials: MS Dhoni Matches: India v Sri Lanka at Mumbai Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: India #p#MS Dhoni had just sent the Wankhede Stadium into delirium by upper-cutting Thisara Perera for a six over point. That made it 37 required off 41, with six wickets in hand and the World Cup in sight. He dabbed the next ball towards point, took a couple of steps and stopped, and then hared across, realising Yuvraj Singh had come too far down. The single was completed, everything seemed all right, but Dhoni smashed his pad with his bat. The thud was so loud it could be heard from near the sightscreen, despite all the noise from the stands, where the crowd was going crazy. #p#It is rare that Dhoni makes such shows of emotion. The one other notable time he did so was during an IPL game in Dharamsala, when he upper-cut his own helmeted face after he had just hit the winning six. He had felt under pressure then. The pressure he will have been under coming into this final is quite perceivable. Before Saturday he had managed just 150 runs in seven innings. He had also made a few unpopular calls as captain during the course of the tournament. And after a poor finish to their bowling effort in this match, and an ordinary start batting, India's World Cup dream was coming apart. #p#When Virat Kohli fell to a fabulous return catch by Tillakaratne Dilshan, the seemingly out-of-form captain promoted himself ahead of the eventual Man of the Tournament. It was a sensible move. As Dhoni himself said later, he wanted to split the cluster of left-hand batsmen in India's middle order, but he also thinks he reads Muttiah Muralitharan's doosra better than the others in that middle order. #p#Sense or no sense, it was a risky move. "It was a big decision," Dhoni said later. "I knew that if I promoted myself and didn't score runs I would be asked why I couldn't stay back." Even though Dhoni has become a much safer captain than he was at the start of his captaincy, he still has it in him to come up with inspired moves in big games. #p#Just making the move was not enough this time, though. He had to go out himself and make the move work. Dhoni certainly can't be blamed for not having a sense of occasion or timing. On the night of the big final, out came the calculating Dhoni, the perfect mix of caution and aggression, strong as an ox, fast as a hare, the same batsman who, not long ago, was quite deservingly the No. 1 in ODIs. #p#During that golden period which took him to the top of the rankings, Dhoni instinctively knew how he'd have to react in any situation. He could absorb pressure, he could accumulate, he could explode. The last year hasn't been that good, but a World Cup final is not a bad time at all for a reprise. #p#On the eve of the final, all Dhoni practised in the nets was hitting big sixes. He batted on the pitch adjacent to the one used for the match, and kept smashing bowlers towards Marine Drive. That was not what was required in the actual match, and Dhoni knew that. When he came in to bat, the required run rate was headed towards six, but it also needed to be maintained for 28.2 overs. It would require a lot of ones and twos, and the loose balls would need to be punished wholesomely. #p#No loose ball went unpunished once Dhoni was set. He did take his time getting set, and relied on Gambhir to maintain the momentum. He was itching to charge down to the part-time offspin of Dilshan, but didn't want to take the risk. In his head the rate was worked out. For the first 10 overs of his stay Dhoni didn't hit a single boundary. Then Muttiah Muralitharan pitched short, and in his own special way Dhoni managed to punch it powerfully enough to beat sweeper cover. That shot alone kept the rate in check, accounting for all of Dhoni's first four boundaries. #p#It takes more than just timing to beat the sweeper cover with shots along the ground in the middle overs. That seems like a safe route to go to, but it generally only provides singles or twos. Dhoni, though, gives those punches a solid whack; the power is generated as his massive legs rock back. In between, he and his India A partner from the start of their respective careers, Gambhir, ran well, ever alert to overthrows and misfields. #p#Once Gambhir tired, Dhoni took over the responsibility of scoring. In the time that Gambhir moved from 87 to 97, Dhoni went from 29 to 60. A perfect transition was taking place when Gambhir got out. Dhoni took some more responsibility then, waiting for the batting Powerplay, but not risking taking it earlier. He knows better by now. It began with India needing 30 off 30, and a good over from Lasith Malinga made it 27 from 24. #p#Now another Dhoni special surfaced: the drag-flick-like shot that he plays with a much-defined bottom hand and an extravagant flick of his wrists, keeping the ball along the ground but imparting immense power. Three bottom-handed blows, and the game was over. The stylist in Dhoni, though, remains. With five required, he almost pulled Yuvraj out of his crease to get on strike. #p#And then he put his pre-match practice to use, lofting Nuwan Kulasekara for the match-winning, hell-raising six. India's World Cup began on Dhoni's terms; how could the end be different?
49	509314	India v Sri Lanka, final, World Cup 2011, Mumbai	India's cup of joy overflows	Nagraj Gollapudi at the Wankhede Stadium	April 3, 2011	A moment to cherish: Sachin Tendulkar celebrates with one of his longtime fans, Sudhir Gautam Getty Images Enlarge Related Links News : Tendulkar won't stop - Kirsten Matches: India v Sri Lanka at Mumbai Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: India #p#Sachin Tendulkar walked out of the changing room and gestured to Sudhir Gautam to come up. Gautam is the thin man with the shaven head - for the past few weeks adorned with a replica of the World Cup - and body covered in the Indian tri-colour. For at least half a decade now, Gautam has been Tendulkar's biggest fan, waving the Indian flag and blowing his conch shell at every venue Tendulkar plays. Today, Tendulkar decided to repay Gautam for his devotion. #p#No sooner had he realised that Tendulkar was calling, than Gautam jumped the electronic advertising hoarding and skipped up the 30-odd stairs on to the corridor of the Indian changing room. All through his short journey he screamed in delight. Tendulkar shook hands with him, then embraced him and finally asked one of his team-mates to get the World Cup trophy. Zaheer Khan brought the cup outside with utmost care and held it tight. Gautam almost snatched it out of his hands but Zaheer held on. Eventually Zaheer let go and Gautam lifted the Cup with both hands, screaming "India" Tendulkar could not help but smile; he started clapping and was joined by a few of his team-mates. The sweat on Tendulkar's face glistened under the floodlights, enhancing his joy of winning the World Cup. #p#It was a day when the common man felt he was part of something special, when the gap between fan and superstar was bridged, with Gautam becoming the envy of fellow fans as he freely slipped in and out of the most sought after place in India, the team's dressing room. #p#It was also a time for private moments. Dhoni held his wife Sakshi close to him; Virender Sehwag hugged his wife Aarti and son Aryavir; Ashish Nehra's wife wore a replica of his team shirt as she moved in and out of the dressing room. Gary Kirsten's wife Deborah joined the rest later. Yuvraj Singh, returning from the media conference, started dancing as he entered the dressing room. On his way inside, he had let out a scream of jubilation. #p#The tempo in the dressing room had remained positive through the day and by the time MS Dhoni hit his spectacular six over long on against Nuwan Kulasekara, it had become a well of joy. As soon as Tendulkar found a private moment with his wife, Anjali, he embraced her tightly. It was a poignant moment. He knew how much she had sacrificed to support him in his endeavours. On the field, during the victory celebrations, he had hugged Yuvraj Singh, the man of the World Cup. Yuvraj had already declared he had dedicated the victory to Tendulkar. Virat Kohli had delivered the line of the evening when he said that for 21 years Tendulkar had shouldered the dreams of a billion Indians. Today youngsters such as Kohli and Suresh Raina carried Tendulkar over their shoulders during the lap of honour. Tears came easily to Tendulkar then. #p#On their way to the team bus, the players got a loud round of applause from hundreds of cops, who turned themselves into fans for a few minutes by taking pictures. Some looked in awe at Tendulkar, who sat in the front seat with his wife sitting next to him. Both their kids sat on their laps. Some of the security people played with Sehwag's son, tapping on the window shield. When Yuvraj walked into the team bus with the trophy in hand, all the administrators and cops let him know how much they enjoyed his performances during the tournament. Gautam blowed his conch shell marking the departure of the bus. The cops yelled " Bharat mata ki, jai (long live India)" #p#The streets of Mumbai were flooded with ecstatic fans Associated Press Enlarge #p#Unfortunately, there was no victory ride back to the team hotel unlike in 2007, when Dhoni had led India to victory in the World Twenty20. Also, disappointingly, the team hotel was out of bounds to the public. Barricades were put in place at all entry points leading up to the Taj Mahal Palace hotel in South Mumbai. The players had planned to celebrate the whole night and the Taj security did not want to take the chance of letting people inside. #p#It did not matter to the fans. Marine Drive, one of the city's most scenic spots, became party central. Fans celebrated by blowing horns, trumpets, whistling, screaming into megaphones, peeping out of open-air cars, sometimes even standing by holding on to the window doors, climbing atop water tankers while waving the flag and dancing. It was a complete carnival atmosphere and the traffic came to a standstill as fireworks lit up the sky for more than two hours. For the first two hours after the match ended, it was hard to find public transport. Even Dave Richardson, the ICC general manager, was forced to leave the Wankhede on foot, walking along with thousands of others #p#In the Trident hotel, there were many Indian fans, who had come from the UK and were enjoying their beer while chanting stuff like "Ala la la.. Ala la la.. Let's all do some bhangra." The hotel's coffee shop, normally pretty vacant, was full. The fans were not disappointed. They continued singing India's praises when they spotted Sourav Ganguly. "Sourav, Sourav" gave way to "Ganguly, Ganguly." #p#It was the Taj Mahal Palace and the Trident that were part of the terrorist attacks on November 26, 2008. Today, they wore a happy look, as did the people of Mumbai. Both were dressed to party; Saturday night fever had taken over.

They were players from the Class of 2003. Each of them told their team-mates his own story about what had happened at the Wanderers that day, about the mistakes of eight years ago that should not be repeated. They had tried too hard, they had been too eager, they had allowed the situation to overwhelm them. It was a cautionary tale. Their words were few, short, and plain and they gave the younger, newer, less-scarred group in front of them a simple instruction: not again. #p#It is how India have performed at the tail end of the World Cup, looking at how their group stage had gone and saying "never again" So that in the last fortnight of this World Cup, they could find a way to ensure that their early mistakes would not be repeated. #p#It is often believed that finals somehow never turn out to be the events that are expected because the high stakes make athletes go cold and freeze up. Much is also said about what captain MS Dhoni called "peaking" in an event, which works more smoothly with individuals than it does with teams. #p#On both counts the Indians came off at the Wankhede Stadium, like the fireworks that lit up the Mumbai night seconds after Dhoni's bold signature six sealed their triumph. The final was the time when all the incomplete notes of India's World Cup performance fell into sync. #p#Gautam Gambhir, who had three fifties in the Cup but had not seized a game by its throat, produced his most convincing performance to lift India from the shock of losing their openers. He was central to two partnerships that took India from 31 for 2 to a six-wicket victory. #p#Dhoni, whose top World Cup score up until the final had been 34, strode out and did not leave the field until victory had been achieved. Of course Yuvraj Singh, the Player of the Tournament and the Indian team's totem through the early rough stages of the tournament, had to be with him at the other end. After defeat to South Africa in the group stages in Nagpur, India's biggest stumble in the World Cup, Yuvraj had told a friend, "I have to take us to the World Cup final. Just you watch. I'm going to take them there." #p#There they were. Not a familiar India, dependent on their batting, but a more secure, self-assured India, batting as if chases in finals were like having a net, except with a crowd cheering them on. This was India in their most accomplished situational batting performance of the event, chasing down 274 with 99 singles, 24 twos and even a three. In every knock-out game, India have, through sheer consistency of method, exposed the weakness of their opposition. They made the most of Australia's uneven bowling attack, defended against Pakistan by pressing hard in the field and forcing their batsmen to fumble, and stunned Sri Lanka by letting the weight and experience of their batting bear down, by taking the barest minimum of risks but making sure to always keep the score moving. #p#India's danger signs for the opposition in this World Cup lay not in their attacking openers or any flood of fours but in what their weakest links were able to do. When Indian fielders start diving, their batsmen start taking threes or sprinting surprising singles, or their most medium of pacers begin to repeatedly beat the edges and hurry batsmen, it is time for the opposition to worry. Or as the old says goes, to be afraid. In a World Cup knockout, that should have read be very afraid. #p#After the game at the Wankhede, Dhoni said that the World Cup win had ended a chapter in Indian cricket that had opened with the World Twenty20 win of 2007. "Right now we can close the chapter. We need to build a team again. Because of the amount of cricket we play, we need quite a few reserve players to come in and bowl. We need spinners and batsmen to be at their best because if we want to do well at the international level, we will have to try out quite a few players and not think about the result." #p#Two weeks ago the audience would have guffawed. Now it must nod in agreement. Today it is perhaps wiser to give Dhoni and India's theories the time to be tried out. After all, over the course of six weeks, with their victory, they have busted a few old ones and proved several of their own right. #p#- That home teams are jinxed in the World Cup and chasing in finals is only a prelude to a meltdown. The Indians managed both at the Wankhede, setting the benchmark for World Cup final chases. If playing at home meant enduring the growing weight of public hope, it was also about enjoying the familiarity of conditions. #p#Yuvraj Singh and Suresh Raina were battle tested by the time India reached the final AFP Enlarge #p#- That options exercised, whether in matches or training, can work if planned smartly. Dhoni said the Indians had known the group stages were going to contain "weak games" and they would need to keep their most seasoned players in prime condition going into the knockouts. "It was a big challenge, series by series we gave rest, or players opted for rest. And to be in a position where we were able to give 100% on the field, each individual throwing themselves around. They had a bit of reserve battery, which they applied throughout the tournament." #p#- That in a major event, covering the most trying of yards and being pushed to the edge is always more useful than coasting through to the final hurdle. In the final, Sri Lanka faced the heat for the first time in their World Cup and could not fall back into producing what their opponents know as their trademark move when defending a score: the mid-innings garotte. It begins with a few tight overs, the tap of runs suddenly shrinking to a trickle, moves onto a field closing in on the batsmen, and finally ends with one wicket and then another. On the contrary, the Indians had earlier survived several 31 for 2-like scenarios before. Had they lost Dhoni soon, the batsmen who followed - Yuvraj Singh and Suresh Raina knew how to resuscitate an innings because they had been there, done that. Yuvraj with Raina versus Australia, and Raina with the lower order against Pakistan. #p#- That fielding can be lifted, no matter what vintage the players may belong to. All through the tournament Dhoni had constantly reminded outsiders that the Indians were not really good fielders, yet in the knockouts they stepped up a level with every game. No matter how clumsy or unpolished their techniques, the oldest and creakiest of the Indians were diving to stop boundaries. #p#Had the India of the World Cup group stages, the India seen in Bangalore or Nagpur, been fielding at the Wankhede, the target could have touched 300, because the wicket had smoothed out towards the end of Sri Lanka's innings. The dazzle of India's batting is well known; the bowling, led by Zaheer Khan all through the tournament, had fought back to win territory in the early rounds, like they did against England. #p#Where India were most astonishingly impressive during the knockouts was in cricket's most "unselfish" art - in the field. All through the tournament Dhoni, who specialises in automobile analogies, had compared the Indian fielding to an old car engine trying to adjust to working with hybrid fuel. After the semi-final, he said that all he hoped for now was one more game. "After that, even if some of the cars fall down, it is okay." #p#Then there is this last theory: about India not really hacking it in recent ICC tournaments. Partly true. Not in the World Twenty20 after 2007, not in the Champions Trophy either. But in this one, the ICC's biggest tournament, the Indians more than hacked it. When it came down to the rounds where both ability and nerve came into play, India became the team that refused to be beaten.
49	509369	India v Sri Lanka, final, World Cup 2011, Mumbai	India fined for slow over-rate	ESPNcricinfo staff	April 3, 2011	#p#India have been fined for maintaining a slow over-rate during the World Cup final in Mumbai against Sri Lanka on Saturday. Sri Lanka opted to bat and match referee Jeff Crowe ruled that India were one over short when time allowances were taken into consideration. In accordance with ICC's Code of Conduct regulations governing minor over-rate offences, players are fined 10% of their match fees for every over their side fails to bowl in the allotted time, with the captain fined double that amount. #p#As a result MS Dhoni was fined 20% of his match fee while the rest of the team were fined 10% each. India played three fast bowlers in the match and the innings break had to be reduced to twenty minutes as a result of India's over-rate. India won the match by six wickets.
49	509387	India v Sri Lanka, final, World Cup 2011, Mumbai	Malinga says wet ball hampered bowling	ESPNcricinfo staff	April 3, 2011	Muttiah Muralitharan said the spinners not capitalising on Lasith Malinga's early wickets in the final cost Sri Lanka the match AFP Enlarge Related Links News : 'We're going to miss Murali terribly' - Sangakkara Report : Dhoni and Gambhir lead India to World Cup glory Players/Officials: Lasith Malinga | Muttiah Muralitharan Matches: India v Sri Lanka at Mumbai Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: India | Sri Lanka #p#Lasith Malinga and Muttiah Muralitharan came in to the World Cup final with 27 wickets between them in the tournament. They were expected to lead Sri Lanka's attack on Saturday, but Murali went wicketless and Malinga couldn't build on his first spell of 2 for 11 in four overs. #p#Malinga got the early wickets of Virender Sehwag and Sachin Tendulkar, but failed to give Sri Lanka a breakthrough in the middle overs, as he so often does with the old ball. When he came on in the end, with India closing in on a win, he bowled one over for three runs, but his next went for 11, relieving the pressure on India's batsmen. Malinga suggested the dew may have affected his bowling later on in the innings. #p#"I couldn't bowl yorkers properly because the ball was too wet," Malinga said on his return to Colombo on Sunday. "It was difficult to swing the ball. I tried hard. I regret I couldn't take more wickets." This was not the first time in the World Cup that a player had said he was hampered by dew. After England's loss to Bangladesh in Chittagong, Graeme Swann had likened bowling with a wet ball to playing football with your hands tied behind your back. #p#On that occasion, England had been put in to bat by Bangladesh, but on Saturday, it was Sri Lanka's decision to bat first. They had bowled second during their group match against New Zealand in Mumbai, and on that occasion dismissed the opposition for 153. Malinga had been expensive in that match, going for more than seven runs an over, but had not been required to bowl more than five overs, as Sri Lanka's spinners ran through New Zealand. Murali, who took four wickets in that game, had said that it was tough to turn the wet ball but one had to learn how to adjust and think of other ways to dismiss batsmen. #p#During the final, Murali didn't look 100% fit - though his captain later insisted "he was fine" - and rarely troubled India's batsmen in his eight overs which went for 39. He said the 274 Sri Lanka had posted was enough to defend but the spinners not capitalising on Malinga's start was the main reason for the loss. #p#"We got enough runs on the board; 274 was a good score. Malinga took two vital wickets but after that we couldn't crack their side, especially in the middle part," Murali said. "The spinners didn't take enough wickets. #p#"If I or Suraj [Randiv] took a few wickets then the story would have been different. These things happen in cricket so you have to move on and I'd like to wish the team well for the future. Hopefully, in 2015 they'll bring home the cup." #p#Randiv, who had only joined the squad after an injury to Angelo Mathews and found himself playing in the tournament for the first time in the final, went wicketless in nine overs, while Tillakaratne Dilshan picked up one wicket with his part-time offspin. #p#The loss meant Murali's one-day career did not have the dream finish that his Test career did - he took eight wickets, including his 800th in a victorious last Test - and he admitted he was disappointed. "It was a little bit disappointing because my main aim was to win the World Cup. But unfortunately we couldn't do that because India were a better side on the day." #p#While Murali had announced before the tournament started that this would be his last international series, Malinga has now said he will not play another World Cup. He has been injury prone, with a recurring knee injury being a source of constant concern, and said he will not last till 2015, by when he will be 31. #p#"I hope to be of service to my team as long as I can, but I won't be able to play in the next World Cup in 2015," Malinga said. "I have been carrying injuries for the past few weeks with little rest." He was rested from Sri Lanka's first two group games but has since played seven matches in just over a month. #p#Malinga has been part of two losing teams in World Cup finals, in a stop-start career that comprised only 30 Tests and 84 one-dayers since debuting in 2004. #p#While they couldn't do enough in the final, Murali and Malinga both had their moments in the tournament. Malinga grabbed a second World Cup hat-trick in Sri Lanka's group-stage match against Kenya, and then took three wickets in the semi-final against New Zealand. Murali bagged three wickets in his last game in his hometown of Kandy, got four in the group match against New Zealand and then struck with his last ball in Sri Lanka, in the semi-final. #p#When he announced his retirement, Murali had said he would continue playing domestic Twenty20 tournaments, and he will turn out for Kochi Tuskers Kerala in the IPL, which starts on April 8. After that he plans to play for Wellington for a couple of seasons on New Zealand's domestic circuit, most likely in the HRV Cup. He said he would go to Wellington because he had promised former Chennai Super Kings team-mate Stephen Fleming he would. #p#"Stephen has a bit to do with Wellington, so I have promised him I would come to play for two years to help them," Muralitharan said. "It's up to Stephen to put through a deal for me. I've always enjoyed playing there. You have nice, friendly people and a competitive [international] cricket team given that they made the [World Cup] semi-finals again." #p#Murali will also spend time working on his plan to build a sports complex for war-displaced civilians. "Cricket unites communities," he said. "We can use the game to reach out and help those who are less privileged than us, to make their lives a little bit easier."

Jayawardene's was the first instance of a batsman scoring a century in a World Cup final in a losing cause. #p#"I would swap that century any day for a championship medal," Jayawardene told the ICC , adding that India's batting line-up proved too strong to defend 274 against. "We fought well but it wasn't enough. We had to take wickets to control this Indian batting line-up. We got a couple of early wickets but we couldn't get anything going after that. "We didn't have the penetration that we normally do, and they batted very well." #p#Jayawardene's unbeaten innings of 103 was a flawless one. He struck boundaries and rotated the strike with ease, and was supported by Nuwan Kulasekara and Thisara Perera in the batting Powerplay. "When I went in it felt really good, got a couple of loose balls and I struck a few boundaries. That gave me the rhythm and momentum. #p#"When Kumar got out I knew I had to bat the 50 overs. With the Powerplays you know you can catch up. I'm quite happy with the effort but unfortunately we ended up on the losing side." #p#About his own future with Sri Lanka, Jayawardene said he was keen to continue playing. "It's important for us to mould the next generation of cricketers in Sri Lanka as well. I'll try and push myself to do that and be better than I am right now. There'll come a day when I'll feel I won't be able to contribute to this team, that's when I'll call it a day."

It was India's victory in the World Twenty20 under Dhoni that was one of the factors that led to the speedy launch of the Indian Premier League. Dhoni then led his team, the Chennai Super Kings, to a double last year, winning the IPL and the Champions League Twenty20 in South Africa. #p#Yet, more than once during this World Cup, Dhoni has demonstrated that he is conscious of the course taken by Indian cricket in the last three decades and where Saturday's victory now stands. #p#At the media conference following India's six-wicket victory, Dhoni was asked by an English reporter to explain what the World Cup victory actually meant to Indians who, Dhoni was told, did not enjoy much success in other world-level sport. Yuvraj Singh, the World Cup's Player of the Tournament sitting next to Dhoni, raised his eyebrow, and his captain took the opportunity to say that India had been growing as a nation that supports sport, citing the examples from shooting, badminton, hockey and football. #p#But cricket, Dhoni said, "was special" to Indians because of the change that the 1983 victory achieved for Indian cricket. "People started loving the sport and you then saw two individuals making their debut, Anil Kumble and Sachin Tendulkar." He then said that the successful careers of Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid, which began in 1996, marked the next step. "This was the chain of players because of whom we are in this position right now. We earn a lot of money, we get a lot respect and what we are trying to do is to pass it onto the next generation." #p#Three of the players mentioned by Dhoni were at the Wankhede Stadium on Saturday night; Tendulkar a part of Dhoni's team, Kumble in the audience and new commentator-columnist Ganguly, who stood at the boundary on the far side of dressing room from where he watched the Indian team go past on its lap of honour with Tendulkar sitting on Yusuf Pathan's shoulders. Ganguly, who led India to the final of the 2003 World Cup and who still responds to India's performance as if he were a part of the team, was beaming. "What a win," he said, "what a performance." #p#Dhoni was asked to compare his two biggest victories as India captain and said, that while every format was "special" in its own way, "I have always loved the ODI format. Because I always think you see a lot of variety in one-day cricket." The final he said had been the best example. "In this game, we lost a couple of early wickets and then you have two batsmen struggling to get runs." He said that the one-day game showed "a glimpse" of what may not be Test cricket but was a shortened version of its demands. #p#"Two batsmen looking for survival and looking to get runs at the same time. At the end you saw a slog, from Yuvraj and me. And at the end of it," Dhoni said, "you see a result." It is a summary that would please the ICC enormously which, after the unfortunate 2007 event in the Caribbean, has needed a successful World Cup to prove to its community that the three formats of the sport could survive. Between that World Cup and this one, there has been a mushrooming of the Twenty20 leagues, and was seen as a threat to the 50-over format. Now with the captain of the 2011 World Cup winners, and the biggest audience and market in the sport, enthusiastically endorsing the format, the ICC has further proof of what it has always maintained: that the 50-over game can play a few more innings.

But he may not hang up his boots just yet. When asked about retirement, Tendulkar deflected the question initially, before saying he saw no reason to change things as he was still enjoying the game. #p#"This is a moment to celebrate, not one to think about my future," Tendulkar told the ICC. "This is the reason I started playing cricket; to do something for the country. The process has been a long one, and I am still enjoying my game, so I don't see the reason to change anything." #p#Gary Kirsten, for whom the World Cup final was his last game as coach of India, also said he didn't think Tendulkar would stop here. "Sachin is the greatest sporting role model I've met in my life," Kirsten said. "He's had an incredible last three or four years, and he's enjoying his cricket even more. I don't think he is going to stop." #p#Tendulkar had to wait till his sixth World Cup campaign to win the trophy, and when asked whether this was the final accolade he needed to complete his closet-full of achievements, he said it was in fact the first thing he wanted to achieve. #p#"As a young boy I dreamt of winning this trophy; that's where it all started. This is by far the best moment and it's the one I've been waiting for for 24 years. There have been heart-breaking losses; in past campaigns we lost in the semi-finals and finals. I never gave up because this was my dream and now the team has managed to win this cup for the nation." #p#After their victory on Saturday, the Indian team spent the night celebrating with their families and friends before going to Raj Bhavan on Sunday to meet the Indian president. But what Tendulkar is looking forward to is sharing the experience with the Indian public. #p#"The victory hasn't sunk in yet because I haven't faced the general crowd outside. I've just mingled around with my friends and family. We've been in a close unit behind a wall of security. We haven't had a chance to experience or share our joy with everyone else. That's a reaction I'm really looking forward to because I can imagine what it would be like. All I've seen is their reactions on the news channels and it's absolutely fascinating." #p#India have now achieved the two things Kirsten had planned on during his tenure as coach: winning the World Cup and attaining the No. 1 ranking in Tests, but he gave all the credit to his team. #p#"The players are the ones who have had to deal with the pressure and expectations," he said. "They've prepared hard and when they've had to make the plays and make the contributions under pressure they've done that." #p#The final at the Wankhede Stadium started with an odd incident where the toss had to be redone because the match referee had not heard Kumar Sangakkara's call. Dhoni thought he had won the toss initially, but Kirsten said they weren't too worried anyway. #p#"I didn't hear too much about what happened at the toss, but we just got on with it because we had already spoken about how we would face obstacles in the final. We would have batted first, but we felt confident after the Australia chase that it didn't matter whether we won or lost the toss. We would have liked to bat first and put up a big total, but cometh the hour cometh the man, and MS Dhoni left his big knock of the World Cup for the final." #p#While Dhoni, Tendulkar and Man-of-the-Tournament Yuvraj Singh have been the centre of attention after the win, India's campaign has had several heroes. Zaheer Khan finished as the joint-leading wicket-taker in the tournament, with 21 scalps, and though his figures on Saturday were marred by an expensive last two overs, Kirsten acknowledged his opening spell of 5-3-6-1 played a key role in restricting Sri Lanka to a chaseable target. #p#"Zak's early spell was what kept them down to 270 despite a strong finish by them. We kept them anchored in their innings; they couldn't really get going. [Mahela] Jayawardene's incredible knock gave them some momentum and they did well to get to where they did. But we felt 270 was very gettable." #p#There has been much speculation about what Kirsten will do next, but, though he acknowledged he had been approached about the position of coach of the South African side, he said he would take a month or two off before making any decisions. #p#"I'm going to take some time off and spend some time with my family who haven't seen me in a while, and I'll decide on my future after one or two months. South Africa have approached me, but I've told them I'm not going to make any decisions just yet. I'm going to clear my mind for a while after this magnificent journey."

"He is very sharp and always alert. He reads the situation well and is open to sharing ideas. He always has discussions with bowlers, batsmen and senior players separately." #p#Tendulkar, who has played under six captains, including Mohammad Azharuddin, Sourav Ganguly and Anil Kumble, praised Dhoni's ability to maintain his composure whatever the match situation. "He is always calm and never shows his frustration. These are some of the human qualities which have made him such a good captain. He is a fantastic captain." #p#India beat Sri Lanka by six wickets in the final in Mumbai after coming through the knockout stages with hard-fought wins over Australia and Pakistan and a patchy performance in the group matches. Tendulkar said that India had "peaked" when it mattered the most. "In the knockout stage we peaked at the right time; it was most important. We knew either the batting was clicking, or bowling, or fielding but everything was not clicking together, but [apart from] in the last three games. Everybody contributed, right from seniors to the juniors in the team. No one can guarantee results but efforts can be [guaranteed]." #p#After India's victory in the final, Dhoni had said the team had felt the pressure of expectations right through the tournament. Tendulkar said the key to handling that pressure lay in focussing on individual performances. "Pressure and expectation are always there, we were thinking that as individuals we should perform our best. We were not thinking that if a bowler fails, others will take wickets like that; we wanted to do our individual best and perform as a team. #p#"The responsibility is on all the team members equally. Like me, it was the dream of all the team members to get this World Cup." #p#Tendulkar said that while lifting the trophy was on the players' minds, the focus was on restricting Sri Lanka to a gettable target and "go through the process and finish the game" He said the pre-World Cup preparatory camp the team had in Bangalore also played a key role in the team's preparation. #p#Tendulkar paid tribute to the efforts of outgoing coach Gary Kirsten, saying that while he would like Kirsten to continue, he respected his decision to leave, and that the team would "miss" him.

Talking to Mid-Day after India's victory in the World Cup final, Tendulkar said the prospect of lifting the Cup in front of his home crowd had motivated him through tough times. #p#"That [winning the World Cup at the Wankhede Stadium] was my dream after we lost in 2007," Tendulkar said. "I took up that challenge. I said, the next World Cup is in Mumbai and this is where I would want the trophy. It was a challenge and I started working towards that. #p#"After the 2007 World Cup when we got to know that the next one is in India and the final would be held in Mumbai. That is when I felt that this is the place where we have to lift the trophy." #p#Tendulkar admitted the 2007 exit, which came on the back of a patch of poor personal form was the toughest phase of his career. "Yeah, it was really tough," Tendulkar said. "My family and friends really supported me at that stage. It was probably the toughest phase of my career and I was really demoralised. Talking about the World Cup in India at that time was something which motivated me. The final in Mumbai, that was greater motivation because here is where I grew up playing cricket. I wanted to do something really, really special here in India and Mumbai." #p#Tendulkar said MS Dhoni's winning hit in the final was the most unforgettable moment of the campaign. "The moment the winning runs were scored, I jumped," he said. "Viru [Virender Sehwag] who was next to me, jumped too. We were sitting in the dressing room and praying." #p#India's win included hard-fought victories against each of the former World Cup champions. Tendulkar scored two centuries in losing causes, but rated his chancy 85 against Pakistan as his most important contribution. Tendulkar recalled a couple of critical moments in that game, which India went on to win and extend their unbeaten record against Pakistan in World Cups. #p#"We set a 6-3 field against Pakistan at Mohali," Tendulkar said. "Their opening batsman, Mohammad Hafeez tried to play a sweep shot off Munaf Patel and got caught behind. I thought that was the turning point of the match. #p#"The catch Viru took off Shahid Afridi [was also crucial]. The match was very much alive then because Misbah-ul-Haq and Afridi were batting and we needed two-three big overs at that stage, so that was an important catch. An easy one, but important."

Obviously, he is the greatest ever captain to lead India." #p#Ganguly's pronouncement came a day after Sachin Tendulkar rated Dhoni as the best captain he had played under. Dhoni made his international debut under Ganguly, before becoming a key player under Rahul Dravid's captaincy. Eventually, Dhoni took over the reins of the side and Ganguly even played under him in the closing stages of his international career. #p#Ganguly said he was sure India would win the tournament once they got past their 2003 nemesis, Australia. "When they beat Australia in the quarter-finals, I knew India would win the World Cup," Ganguly said. "A lot of people thought Sri Lanka would win, but I was confident."
49	509644	India crowned world champions	Simons calls Munaf Patel the unsung hero	Sharda Ugra	April 5, 2011	Munaf Patel gave Zaheer Khan the freedom to bowl aggressively Getty Images Enlarge Related Links News : 'We knew we were going to win' - Kirsten Players/Officials: Munaf Patel | Eric Simons Matches: India v Sri Lanka at Mumbai Series/Tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup Teams: India #p#Bowling coach Eric Simons has called Munaf Patel the unsung hero of India's World Cup victory, saying the high degree of technical skills that India's bowling attack possessed made up for its lack of express pace all through the tournament. #p#After the World Cup win, as the Indian team made their euphoric victory lap around the Wankhede, Munaf and Simons, who had missed the lap, were found outside the group, talking and laughing. Munaf, Simons said, had been one of the most inspirational stories he had encountered. #p#Munaf would not have been an automatic choice for the playing XI, had injury not ruled out Praveen Kumar from the squad before the start of the World Cup. Praveen had until then formed, along with Ashish Nehra, the back-up unit for Zaheer Khan. "We had singled out the bowlers for the last 3-4 series and Praveen's injury had been a setback for us as he was part of our plans," Simons said. #p#It was Munaf, Simons said, who had given the bowling unit reassurance when he arrived, with both an awareness of his own skills and his ability to adapt. "Munaf is one of the unsung heroes of the World Cup for us - he stepped in and played a vital part for us, after we lost Praveen and Ashish suffered from injuries during the tournament. Munaf has learnt to understand his bowling and stuck to his game plan taking some crucial wickets." Munaf was India's third-highest wicket-taker in the World Cup behind Zaheer and Yuvraj Singh with 11 victims. #p#Munaf's wicket-to-wicket line and ability to generate bounce off the Indian tracks made him hard to get away by opposition batsman. Despite the pounding received by the bowlers in the early half of the tournament, "Munaf never once doubted himself or what he could offer the team," Simons said. "His work ethic is enormous; he has a very strong and steady head on his shoulders and calmness in any situation. He gave Zaheer the freedom to bowl very freely and aggressively." Simons said in his 15 months with the team, Munaf had become a "close friend." #p#When he came into the Indian set-up from South Africa, Simons said that it had been his job to "bring a different outlook to the bowling unit, not to tell them how to bowl, but just offer ideas about what options they could take." The main areas of focus during the World Cup, the bowlers understood, would be the advantage of familiar conditions and bowling to their strengths. "There was a great deal of talent in the bowling line-up and we knew that our plans had to be based around their skills. What happens is that a lot of time people make plans for bowlers that really don't suit them." #p#The bowlers understood that building pressure through containment could be made to play as important a role as taking wickets, particularly if they could give the batsmen a 100 runs less to chase when batting second. Simons said, "We spoke a lot about bowling partnerships, that if you weren't getting wickets, building pressure on one side could get wickets at the other." India's plans were flexible but the bowlers had talked about the different venues and batsmen they would be bowling to, working out possibilities of "lines, angles and variations of pace" that could come into play. "We talked about the fields that could be set to their bowling, who had to stay slightly deeper for the singles, who had to field where. #p#"My admiration for the guys grew and I have been very impressed by what they can do in conditions that do not suit them at all. It is what Indian bowlers have to do to succeed here. We had a high degree of technical skills in our side, which showed that you didn't need a bowler of express pace to make a difference." It is why, he said, that when overseas pace bowlers travelled to India, they looked what he described as "less daunting." #p#Zaheer had become one of the best practitioners of his art in the world according to Simons. In the months leading up to the World Cup, he had developed the slower slow ball that wobbles, and works particularly well against left-handers. In ESPNcricinfo commentary during the World Cup, it was first described as the 'bare knuckle ball', as it comes off the knuckle and rather than spin on its axis, wobbles over a couple of times. It has got the better of a few batsmen in the World Cup. Simons said that the team calls it the 'knuckle ball.' "Zaheer began working on it during the World Twenty20 in the West Indies and was ready to use it during the World Cup." The knuckle ball, Simons explained, could not be spotted by the batsmen through the grip and the bowler could even use arm-rotation at his normal speed to be able to bowl it. #p#About Harbhajan Singh's role in the tournament, in which he took nine wickets, but bowled at an economy rate of 4.48 Simons said, that the off-spinner, who "wears his heart on his sleeve and wants to perform" was affected at not taking wickets, in the first half of the tournament but hit his stride in the knock outs. "Early on he was frustrated at not getting more wickets and that is natural but we realised as a strike bowler for our team all opposition batsmen would see him as a threat and try to block out, which is what happened. But he got more aggressive in the second half of the tournament, and found when batsmen were forced to try and go after him, he took important wickets." #p#Given the future calendar for Indian cricket which involves tours to West Indies, England and Australia, Simons said he believed India would have to both rotate their best bowlers to keep them ready for the big events and also refresh their bench strength to get bowlers like Jaidev Unadkat and Umesh Yadav, for example, playing enough at the highest level to do the job when they had to be suddenly called in.
49	794215	50	A two-decade long dream			shares #p#Play 03:52 #p#1983. The top edge swirled high above him, teasing Kapil Dev as he chased after it. Head craning up, legs pumping and arms reaching for a catch that would crown Indian cricket folklore. It took 28 years to summon an instance that could match its impact. An India captain was at the epicenter again, twirling his bat as casually after he had creamed a six to win the Word Cup. #p#That shot would become the cornerstone of MS Dhoni's legend. It also became a signal of India's new identity - a team that believed they were more than a match for any opposition. Dhoni's innings was an emphatic advertisement. He had been struggling for form and his team had made a poor start, but none of that mattered as he promoted himself to No. 5 and cut, sliced, slapped and helicoptered 91 off 79 balls. The nation erupted and Kapil was moved to tears on live television. #p#For 22 of those years, Indian cricket had turned to one man for  everything. Sachin Tendulkar would have known this was the last chance he would have to claim the one title he craved, especially after the sting of 2007 when India were booted out after the first round. "That [winning the World Cup at the Wankhede Stadium] was my dream after we lost in 2007. I said, the next World Cup is in Mumbai and this is where I would want the trophy," Tendulkar had said. He had racked up international century numbers 98 and 99 but neither of them had been in a winning cause. He might have braced for heartbreak after being dismissed for 18. But by the end of the night, he was hoisted on the shoulders of his team-mates, whirling the national flag above his head. Finally, he was a World Cup champion. ESPN Sports Media Ltd..
49	794351	49	A pearl that could have been priceless			shares #p#Play 03:47 #p#There have been six centuries in a World Cup final. Only one of those has not been good enough to lift the trophy. Mahela Jayawardene couldn't really be blamed, though. He had mesmerised as he dissected India's attack. The bowlers found the leather in their hands betraying them, its favour won by Jayawardene's strokeplay. He walked out of a raucous Wankhede Stadium unconquered, with a serene 103 next to his name. #p#"I knew he was going to get runs that day. He just had that look," said Kumar Sangakkara. A look that Jayawardene regularly wears during a big match. A look that transforms his partner at the other end to the happiest spectator in the world. A look that has left opposition captains clueless. #p#The pace of the innings was precise and its construction careful. His first fifty came off 49 balls, the second in 35. It did not deserve to be the only one of Jayawardene's 16 ODI centuries to not have clinched victory for Sri Lanka. #p#"This was a lifetime opportunity of winning the World Cup. But it was taken away by a great innings." Perhaps he remembered his own words from 2007 when he had led Sri Lanka to the final, when their progress to the final could largely have been attributed to another memorable century by him, against New Zealand in Kingston. Back then, Sri Lanka bore the brunt of Adam Gilchrist's blitzkrieg innings; luck wasn't on their side in 2011 either, but 2015 is just around the corner and Jayawardene has even bargained off his Test career for the chance to travel to Australia and script a different ending.
